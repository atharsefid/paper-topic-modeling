The Saccharomyces cerevisiae small GTPase, Gsp1p/Ran, is involved in 3' processing of 7S-to-5.8S rRNA and in degradation of the excised 5'-A0 fragment of 35S pre-rRNA, both of which are carried out by the exosome.	Genetics	2001	Dis3p, a subunit of the exosome, interacts directly with Ran. To clarify the relationship between the exosome and the RanGTPase cycle, a series of temperature-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae dis3 mutants were isolated and their 5.8S rRNA processing was compared with processing in strains with mutations in a S. cerevisiae Ran homologue, Gsp1p. In both dis3 and gsp1 mutants, 3' processing of 7S-to-5.8S rRNA was blocked at three identical sites in an allele-specific manner. In contrast, the 5' end of 5.8S rRNA was terminated normally in gsp1 and in dis3. Inhibition of 5.8S rRNA maturation in gsp1 was rescued by overexpression of nuclear exosome components Dis3p, Rrp4p, and Mtr4p, but not by a cytoplasmic exosome component, Ski2p. Furthermore, gsp1 and dis3 accumulated the 5'-A0 fragment of 35S pre-rRNA, which is also degraded by the exosome, and the level of 27S rRNA was reduced. Neither 5.8S rRNA intermediates nor 5'-A0 fragments were observed in mutants defective in the nucleocytoplasmic transport, indicating that Gsp1p regulates rRNA processing through Dis3p, independent of nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Peptide-specific intercellular transfer of MHC class II to CD4+ T cells directly from the immunological synapse upon cellular dissociation.	J Immunol	2005	The transfer of membrane proteins from APC to T cells was initially described in the 1970s, and subsequent work has described two mechanisms of transfer: APC-derived exosomes and direct transfer of small packets, while cells remain conjugated. Using fibroblast APC expressing a GFP-tagged I-E(k) molecule with covalently attached antigenic peptide, we observed a third mechanism in live cell imaging: T cells spontaneously dissociating from APC often capture MHC:peptide complexes directly from the immunological synapse. Using two I-E(k)-restricted murine TCR transgenic T cells with different peptide specificity, we show in this study that the MHC transfer is peptide specific. Using blocking Abs, we found that MHC:peptide transfer in this system requires direct TCR-MHC:peptide interactions and is augmented by costimulation through CD28-CD80 interactions. Capture of the GFP-tagged MHC:peptide complexes correlates with an activated phenotype of the T cell, elevated CD69 with down-modulated TCR. The transferred MHC:peptide molecules transferred to the T cell are associated with molecules that imply continued TCR signaling; p56(lck), phosphotyrosine, and polarization of the actin cytoskeleton.	
16652390	David Tollervey	Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, University of Edinburgh, EH9 3JR, UK.			Microarray detection of novel nuclear RNA substrates for the exosome.	Yeast	2006	Microarray analyses were performed on yeast strains mutant for the nuclear-specific exosome components Rrp6p and Rrp47p/Lrp1p or the core component Rrp41p/Ski6p, at permissive temperature and following transfer to 37 degrees C. 339 mRNAs showed clearly altered expression levels, with an unexpectedly high degree of heterogeneity in the different exosome mutants. In contrast, no clear alterations were seen in strains lacking the cytoplasmic exosome component Ski7p. 27 mRNAs that were overexpressed in each strain defective in the nuclear exosome are good candidates for regulation by nuclear turnover. These included the mRNA for the autoregulated RNA-binding protein Nrd1p. Northern and primer extension analyses confirmed the elevated NRD1 mRNA levels in exosome mutants, and revealed the accumulation of truncated 5' fragments of the mRNA. These contain a predicted Nrd1p-binding site, potentially sequestering the protein and disrupting its autoregulation. Several genes located immediately downstream of independently transcribed snoRNA genes were overexpressed in exosome mutants, presumably due to stabilization of the products of transcription termination read-through. Further analyses indicated that many snoRNA and snRNA genes are inefficiently terminated, but read-through transcripts into downstream ORFs are normally rapidly degraded by the exosome.

Gastroenterology	2007	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intestinal epithelial cells release antigen-presenting vesicles (exosomes) bearing major histocompatibility complex class II/peptide complexes stimulating specific immune responses in vivo. To characterize further the role of human epithelial exosomes in antigen presentation, their capacity to load antigenic peptides, bind immune target cells, and induce T-cell activation was analyzed in vitro. METHODS: The capacity of exosomes derived from the HLA-DR4-expressing, intestinal epithelial cell line T84 to load the HLA-DR4-specific peptide (3)H-HSA 64-76 and to activate a HLA-DR4-restricted T-cell hybridoma was tested in the presence or absence of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Interaction of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled exosomes with T cells and DCs was analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: T84-derived exosomes, enriched in CD9, CD81, CD82, and A33 antigen, were capable of binding specifically human serum albumin (HSA) 64-76 peptide on HLA-DR4 molecules and of interacting preferentially with DCs. HSA-loaded exosomes were unable to activate the T-cell hybridoma directly but induced a productive T-cell activation through DCs. When HSA peptide was bound to exosomal HLA-DR4 molecules instead of in a soluble form, the threshold of peptide presentation by DCs was markedly decreased (x10(-3)). CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes released by intestinal epithelial cells bear exogenous peptides complexed to major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and interact preferentially with DCs, strongly potentiating peptide presentation to T cells. Epithelial exosomes constitute a powerful link between luminal antigens and local immune cells by mediating the transfer of tiny amounts of luminal antigenic information and facilitating immune surveillance at mucosal surfaces.

Accelerated release of exosome-associated GM1 ganglioside (GM1) by endocytic pathway abnormality: another putative pathway for GM1-induced amyloid fibril formation.	J Neurochem	2008	Exosomes are extracellularly released small vesicles that are derived from multivesicular bodies formed via the endocytic pathway. We treated pheochromocytoma PC12 cells with chloroquine, an acidotropic agent, which potently perturbs membrane trafficking from endosomes to lysosomes. Chloroquine treatment increased the level of GM1 ganglioside in cell media only when the cells were exposed to KCl for depolarization, which is known to enhance exosome release from neurons. In the sucrose-density-gradient fractionation of cell media, GM1 ganglioside was exclusively recovered with Alix, a specific marker of exosomes, in the fractions with the density corrresponding to that of exosomes. Notably, amyloid-beta assembly was markedly accelerated when incubated with the exosome fraction prepared from the culture media of PC12 cells treated with chloroquine and KCl. Furthermore, amyloid-beta assembly was significantly suppressed by the co-incubation with an antibody specific to GM1-bound amyloid-beta, an endogenous seed for amyloid formation of Alzheimer's disease. Together with our previous finding that chloroquine treatment induces the accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in early endosomes, results of this study suggest that endocytic pathway abnormality accelerates the release of exosome-associated GM1 ganglioside following its accumulation in early endosomes. Furthermore, this study also suggests that extracellular amyloid fibril formation is induced by not only GM1 gangliosides accumulated on the surface of the cells but also those released in association with exosomes.

Senescence-associated exosome release from human prostate cancer cells.	Cancer Res	2008	Males of advanced age represent a rapidly growing population at risk for prostate cancer. In the contemporary setting of earlier detection, a majority of prostate carcinomas are still clinically localized and often treated using radiation therapy. Our recent studies have shown that premature cellular senescence, rather than apoptosis, accounts for most of the clonogenic death induced by clinically relevant doses of irradiation in prostate cancer cells. We show here that this treatment-induced senescence was associated with a significantly increased release of exosome-like microvesicles. In premature senescence, this novel secretory phenotype was dependent on the activation of p53. In addition, the release of exosome-like microvesicles also increased during proliferative senescence in normal human diploid fibroblasts. These data support the hypothesis that senescence, initiated either by telomere attrition (e.g., aging) or DNA damage (e.g., radiotherapy), may induce a p53-dependent increase in the biogenesis of exosome-like vesicles. Ultrastructural analysis and RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Tsg101 provided significant evidence that the additional exosomes released by prematurely senescent prostate cancer cells were principally derived from multivesicular endosomes. Moreover, these exosomes were enriched in B7-H3 protein, a recently identified diagnostic marker for prostate cancer, and an abundance of what has recently been termed "exosomal shuttle RNA." Our findings are consistent with the proposal that exosomes can transfer cargos, with both immunoregulatory potential and genetic information, between cells through a novel mechanism that may be recruited to increase exosome release during accelerated and replicative cellular senescence.

PLoS One	2009	Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of central vision loss in the elderly and smoking is a primary risk factor associated with the prevalence and incidence of AMD. To better understand the cellular and molecular bases for the association between smoking and AMD, we determined the effects of Benzo(a)Pyrene (B(a)P), a toxic element in cigarette smoke, on cultured retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) and we examined the RPE/choroid from mice exposed to chronic cigarette smoke. We measured: mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, phagocytic activity, lysosomal enzymes, exosome markers and selected complement pathway components. In the presence of a non-cytotoxic dose of B(a)P, there was extensive mtDNA damage but no nuclear DNA damage. RPE phagocytic activity was not altered but there were increased lysosomal activity, exocytotic activity and complement pathway components. Retinas from mice exposed to cigarette smoke contained markers for mtDNA damage, exosomes and complement pathway components surrounding Bruch's membrane. Markers for these processes are found in drusen from AMD patients. Thus, smoking may cause damage to mtDNA and increased degradative processes in the RPE. These altered cell biological processes in the RPE may contribute to the formation of drusen in individuals who are cigarette smokers and underlie susceptibility to genetic mutations associated with AMD.

PLoS One	2010	BACKGROUND: Exosomes, derived from endocytic membrane vesicles are thought to participate in cell-cell communication and protein and RNA delivery. They are ubiquitous in most body fluids (breast milk, saliva, blood, urine, malignant ascites, amniotic, bronchoalveolar lavage, and synovial fluids). In particular, exosomes secreted in human saliva contain proteins and nucleic acids that could be exploited for diagnostic purposes. To investigate this potential use, we isolated exosomes from human saliva and characterized their structural and transcriptome contents. METHODOLOGY: Exosomes were purified by differential ultracentrifugation and identified by immunoelectron microscopy (EM), flow cytometry, and Western blot with CD63 and Alix antibodies. We then described the morphology, shape, size distribution, and density using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Microarray analysis revealed that 509 mRNA core transcripts are relatively stable and present in the exosomes. Exosomal mRNA stability was determined by detergent lysis with RNase A treatment. In vitro, fluorescently labeled saliva exosomes could communicate with human keratinocytes, transferring their genetic information to human oral keratinocytes to alter gene expression at a new location. CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that exosomes shuttle RNA between cells and that the RNAs present in the exosomes may be a possible resource for disease diagnostics.

The RNA degradosome in Bacillus subtilis: identification of CshA as the major RNA helicase in the multiprotein complex.	Mol Microbiol	2010	In most organisms, dedicated multiprotein complexes, called exosome or RNA degradosome, carry out RNA degradation and processing. In addition to varying exoribonucleases or endoribonucleases, most of these complexes contain a RNA helicase. In the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, a RNA degradosome has recently been described; however, no RNA helicase was identified. In this work, we tested the interaction of the four DEAD box RNA helicases encoded in the B. subtilis genome with the RNA degradosome components. One of these helicases, CshA, is able to interact with several of the degradosome proteins, i.e. RNase Y, the polynucleotide phosphorylase, and the glycolytic enzymes enolase and phosphofructokinase. The determination of in vivo protein-protein interactions revealed that CshA is indeed present in a complex with polynucleotide phosphorylase. CshA is composed of two RecA-like domains that are found in all DEAD box RNA helicases and a C-terminal domain that is present in some members of this protein family. An analysis of the contribution of the individual domains of CshA revealed that the C-terminal domain is crucial both for dimerization of CshA and for all interactions with components of the RNA degradosome, including RNase Y. A transfer of this domain to CshB allowed the resulting chimeric protein to interact with RNase Y suggesting that this domain confers interaction specificity. As a degradosome component, CshA is present in the cell in similar amounts under all conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that CshA is the functional equivalent of the RhlB helicase of the Escherichia coli RNA degradosome.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2010	The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is expressed in multiple human malignancies and has potent effects on cell growth. It has been detected in exosomes and shown to inhibit immune function. Exosomes are small secreted cellular vesicles that contain proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs). When produced by malignant cells, they can promote angiogenesis, cell proliferation, tumor-cell invasion, and immune evasion. In this study, exosomes released from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells harboring latent EBV were shown to contain LMP1, signal transduction molecules, and virus-encoded miRNAs. Exposure to these NPC exosomes activated the ERK and AKT signaling pathways in the recipient cells. Interestingly, NPC exosomes also contained viral miRNAs, several of which were enriched in comparison with their intracellular levels. LMP1 induces expression of the EGF receptor in an EBV-negative epithelial cell line, and exosomes produced by these cells also contain high levels of EGF receptor in exosomes. These findings suggest that the effects of EBV and LMP1 on cellular expression also modulate exosome content and properties. The exosomes may manipulate the tumor microenvironment to influence the growth of neighboring cells through the intercellular transfer of LMP1, signaling molecules, and viral miRNAs.	PMC2996715

Vaccine	2011	Current methods for sustainable control of avian coccidiosis, whether by prophylactic medication or parasite vaccination, are suboptimal. In this study, we describe an alternative immunization strategy against Eimeria tenella infection using parasite antigen (Ag)-loaded dendritic cells (DCs), or their derived exosomes, in the absence of free Ag. CD45(+) intestinal DCs were isolated from E. tenella-infected chickens and loaded ex vivo with an extract of sporozoites as parasite Ag. Extracellular vesicles purified from the Ag-pulsed DCs expressed surface proteins associated with DC-derived exosomes, including major histocompatibility complex proteins (MHC I and MHC II), CD80, flotillin, and heat shock protein (HSP70). Following intramuscular immunization of chickens with Ag-pulsed DCs or Ag-pulsed DC-derived exosomes, Ag-containing cells were observed diffusely localized in the lymphoid tissue and concentrated in germinal centers of caecal tonsils, and restricted to germinal centers (GC) in the spleen. Chickens immunized with pulsed DCs or exosomes exhibited (a) higher numbers of caecal tonsil and spleen cells expressing IgG and/or IgA antibodies that were reactive with E. tenella Ag, (b) greater numbers of IL-2-, IL-16-, and IFN-γ-producing cells, and (c) higher E. tenella Ag-driven cell proliferation, compared with chickens immunized with Ag in the absence of DCs or exosomes. Chickens immunized with Ag-pulsed DCs or Ag-pulsed DC-derived exosomes and subsequently given a live E. tenella challenge infection at 10d post-immunization displayed (a) increased body weight gains, (b) decreased feed conversion ratios, (c) reduced fecal oocyst shedding, (d) diminished intestinal lesions, and (e) lower mortality, compared with animals given Ag alone. This is the first demonstration of Ag-specific protective immunity against avian coccidiosis using parasite Ag-loaded DCs or DC-derived exosomes.

Kidney Int	2011	Renal dysfunction seen in patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) has been attributed to the use of antimonials for treatment. To determine whether ACL itself causes tubular dysfunction, we measured renal function in 37 patients with ACL prior to their treatment and compared results to that in 10 healthy volunteers of similar mean age. None of the patients presented with glomerular dysfunction; however, 27 had a urinary concentrating defect. There was no statistical difference between groups in the pre- and post-desmopressin test of urine osmolality, but the post-test urine osmolality of the controls was significantly higher. Urinary AQP2 levels, determined by western blot of isolated exosomes, were found to be significantly lower in patients than in controls, whereas that of the cotransporter (NKCC2) was significantly higher. A urinary acidification defect (post-test pH greater than 5.50 following calcium chloride) was found in 15 patients. Pretest plasma bicarbonate was below normal in 12 patients as was the pretest plasma pH in 14. Expression of the Na/H exchanger (NHE3), H(+)-ATPase, and pendrin were all significantly higher in patients with ACL than in controls. A combined urinary concentration and acidification defect was found in 12 patients. Thus, the urinary concentrating defect of ACL may be caused by decreased AQP2, with increased NKCC2 compensatory. Pendrin upregulation may be related to the urinary acidification defect with increased NHE3 and H(+)-ATPase also compensatory. Hence, ACL can cause asymptomatic renal tubular dysfunction.

Exosomes released by K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells promote angiogenesis in a Src-dependent fashion.	Angiogenesis	2012	Exosomes, microvesicles of endocytic origin released by normal and tumor cells, play an important role in cell-to-cell communication. Angiogenesis has been shown to regulate progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The mechanism through which this happens has not been elucidated. We isolated and characterized exosomes from K562 CML cells and evaluated their effects on human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). Fluorescent-labeled exosomes were internalized by HUVECs during tubular differentiation on Matrigel. Exosome localization was perinuclear early in differentiation, moving peripherally in cells undergoing elongation and connection. Exosomes move within and between nanotubular structures connecting the remodeling endothelial cells. They stimulated angiotube formation over a serum/growth factor-limited medium control, doubling total cumulative tube length (P = 0.003). Treatment of K562 cells with two clinically active tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and dasatinib, reduced their total exosome release (P < 0.009); equivalent concentrations of drug-treated exosomes induced a similar extent of tubular differentiation. However, dasatinib treatment of HUVECs markedly inhibited HUVEC response to drug control CML exosomes (P < 0.002). In an in vivo mouse Matrigel plug model angiogenesis was induced by K562 exosomes and abrogated by oral dasatinib treatment (P < 0.01). K562 exosomes induced dasatinib-sensitive Src phosphorylation and activation of downstream Src pathway proteins in HUVECs. Imatinib was minimally active against exosome stimulation of HUVEC cell differentiation and signaling. Thus, CML cell-derived exosomes induce angiogenic activity in HUVEC cells. The inhibitory effect of dasatinib on exosome production and vascular differentiation and signaling reveals a key role for Src in both the leukemia and its microenvironment.	PMC3595015

Mol Cytogenet	2012	BACKGROUND: Structural rearrangements of chromosomal band 19q13 are a non-random cytogenetic abnormality in thyroid adenomas and adenomatous goiters and lead to an expression of miRNAs of the chromosome 19 microRNA cluster C19MC. Normally, expression of these miRNAs is silenced except for embryonic stem cells and the placenta where they represent the majority of miRNAs not only in the trophoblast but also in exosomes derived from it. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: We have advanced the hypothesis that as part of the feto-maternal communication miRNAs of C19MC serve immunomodulatory functions in the placenta and confer a growth advantage to thyroid nodules by protecting them against autoimmune attacks. More precisely, the exosomes containing these miRNAs may specifically target immune cells in their local environment as well as systemically by transferring their cargo to recipient cells. Within these target cells the transferred miRNAs can interact with mRNAs of the recipient cells thereby suppressing their immune-specific functions. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: Experiments used to demonstrate the immunomodulatory capacity of placenta-derived exosomes can be modified by transfecting the target cells with those miRNAs of C19MC represented in placental exosomes. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Mimics of C19MC-derived miRNAs might develop to useful drug candidates for the treatment of autoimmune disease as e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome and for the prevention of transplant rejection. In case of tumor entities with elevated expression of C19MC miRNAs these miRNAs may be interesting targets for treatment with appropriate antagonists.	PMC3388007

Comparison of methods for isolating exosomes from bovine milk.	J Vet Med Sci	2012	Four methods were evaluated for isolating exosomes from bovine milk: (1) ExoQuick precipitation, (2) ultracentrifugation with ExoQuick precipitation, (3) ultracentrifugation with density gradient centrifugation, and (4) human milk exosome isolation. Methods 1 and 4 failed due to differences between bovine and human milk. Exosomes were efficiently isolated by ultracentrifugation with either ExoQuick precipitation (method 2) or density gradient centrifugation (method 3). The highest yield of exosomes was achieved using ultracentrifugation with ExoQuick precipitation, whereas higher quality exosome isolation with intact morphological structures was achieved by ultracentrifugation with density gradient centrifugation.

Comparative and targeted proteomic analyses of urinary microparticles from bladder cancer and hernia patients.	J Proteome Res	2012	Bladder cancer is a common urologic cancer whose incidence continues to rise annually. Urinary microparticles are an attractive material for noninvasive bladder cancer biomarker discovery. In this study, we applied isotopic dimethylation labeling coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to discover bladder cancer biomarkers in urinary microparticles isolated from hernia (control) and bladder cancer patients. This approach identified 2964 proteins based on more than two distinct peptides, of which 2058 had not previously been reported as constituents of human urine exosomes/microparticles. A total of 107 differentially expressed proteins were identified as candidate biomarkers. Differences in the concentrations of 29 proteins (41 signature peptides) were precisely quantified by LC-MRM/MS in 48 urine samples of bladder cancer, hernia, and urinary tract infection/hematuria. Concentrations of 24 proteins changed significantly (p<0.05) between bladder cancer (n=28) and hernia (n=12), with area-under-the-curve values ranging from 0.702 to 0.896. Finally, we quantified tumor-associated calcium-signal transducer 2 (TACSTD2) in raw urine specimens (n=221) using a commercial ELISA and confirmed its potential value for diagnosis of bladder cancer. Our study reveals a strong association of TACSTD2 with bladder cancer and highlights the potential of human urinary microparticles in the noninvasive diagnosis of bladder cancer.

Differential expression of exosomal microRNAs in prefrontal cortices of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients.	PLoS One	2013	Exosomes are cellular secretory vesicles containing microRNAs (miRNAs). Once secreted, exosomes are able to attach to recipient cells and release miRNAs potentially modulating the function of the recipient cell. We hypothesized that exosomal miRNA expression in brains of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) might differ from controls, reflecting either disease-specific or common aberrations in SZ and BD patients. The sources of the analyzed samples included McLean 66 Cohort Collection (Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center), BrainNet Europe II (BNE, a consortium of 18 brain banks across Europe) and Boston Medical Center (BMC). Exosomal miRNAs from frozen postmortem prefrontal cortices with well-preserved RNA were isolated and submitted to profiling by Luminex FLEXMAP 3D microfluidic device. Multiple statistical analyses of microarray data suggested that certain exosomal miRNAs were differentially expressed in SZ and BD subjects in comparison to controls. RT-PCR validation confirmed that two miRNAs, miR-497 in SZ samples and miR-29c in BD samples, have significantly increased expression when compared to control samples. These results warrant future studies to evaluate the potential of exosome-derived miRNAs to serve as biomarkers of SZ and BD.	PMC3559697

Proteome profiling of exosomes derived from human primary and metastatic colorectal cancer cells reveal differential expression of key metastatic factors and signal transduction components.	Proteomics	2013	Exosomes are small extracellular 40-100 nm diameter membrane vesicles of late endosomal origin that can mediate intercellular transfer of RNAs and proteins to assist premetastatic niche formation. Using primary (SW480) and metastatic (SW620) human isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines we compared exosome protein profiles to yield valuable insights into metastatic factors and signaling molecules fundamental to tumor progression. Exosomes purified using OptiPrep™ density gradient fractionation were 40-100 nm in diameter, were of a buoyant density ~1.09 g/mL, and displayed stereotypic exosomal markers TSG101, Alix, and CD63. A major finding was the selective enrichment of metastatic factors (MET, S100A8, S100A9, TNC), signal transduction molecules (EFNB2, JAG1, SRC, TNIK), and lipid raft and lipid raft-associated components (CAV1, FLOT1, FLOT2, PROM1) in exosomes derived from metastatic SW620 cells. Additionally, using cryo-electron microscopy, ultrastructural components in exosomes were identified. A key finding of this study was the detection and colocalization of protein complexes EPCAM-CLDN7 and TNIK-RAP2A in colorectal cancer cell exosomes. The selective enrichment of metastatic factors and signaling pathway components in metastatic colon cancer cell-derived exosomes contributes to our understanding of the cross-talk between tumor and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment.

Methods Mol Biol	2013	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNA molecules that modulate specific target mRNAs and play very important roles in physiological processes. They were recently detected in body fluids such as blood, urine, saliva, and milk. These body fluid miRNAs have been studied thoroughly as potential diagnostic biomarkers. However, there have been few studies of milk miRNAs, and their roles are not clearly understood. Milk is the only nutritional source for newborn infants, and bovine milk is used widely as a dairy product. Thus, it is important to study milk miRNAs. In general, body fluid RNA concentrations are extremely low and of diverse existence types. In this chapter, we compare two silica membrane column-based RNA purification kits, and also compare RNA obtained directly from whey with that isolated from whey-derived exosomes.

Regulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN through exosomes: a diagnostic potential for prostate cancer.	PLoS One	2013	PTEN is a potent tumor-suppressor protein. Aggressive and metastatic prostate cancer (PC) is associated with a reduction or loss of PTEN expression. PTEN reduction often occurs without gene mutations, and its downregulation is not fully understood. Herein, we show that PTEN is incorporated in the cargo of exosomes derived from cancer cells. PTEN is not detected in exosomes derived from normal, noncancerous cells. We found that PTEN can be transferred to other cells through exosomes. In cells that have a reduction or complete loss of PTEN expression, the transferred PTEN is competent to confer tumor-suppression activity to acceptor cells. In PC patients, we show that PTEN is incorporated in the cargo of exosomes that circulate in their blood. Interestingly, normal subjects have no PTEN expression in their blood exosomes. Further, we found that the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is incorporated in PC patients' and normal subjects' blood exosomes. These data suggest that exosomal PTEN can compensate for PTEN loss in PTEN deficient cells, and may have diagnostic value for prostate cancer.	PMC3723640

Cancer cell exosomes depend on cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans for their internalization and functional activity.	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2013	Extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated intercellular transfer of signaling proteins and nucleic acids has recently been implicated in the development of cancer and other pathological conditions; however, the mechanism of EV uptake and how this may be targeted remain as important questions. Here, we provide evidence that heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (PGs; HSPGs) function as internalizing receptors of cancer cell-derived EVs with exosome-like characteristics. Internalized exosomes colocalized with cell-surface HSPGs of the syndecan and glypican type, and exosome uptake was specifically inhibited by free HS chains, whereas closely related chondroitin sulfate had no effect. By using several cell mutants, we provide genetic evidence of a receptor function of HSPG in exosome uptake, which was dependent on intact HS, specifically on the 2-O and N-sulfation groups. Further, enzymatic depletion of cell-surface HSPG or pharmacological inhibition of endogenous PG biosynthesis by xyloside significantly attenuated exosome uptake. We provide biochemical evidence that HSPGs are sorted to and associate with exosomes; however, exosome-associated HSPGs appear to have no direct role in exosome internalization. On a functional level, exosome-induced ERK1/2 signaling activation was attenuated in PG-deficient mutant cells as well as in WT cells treated with xyloside. Importantly, exosome-mediated stimulation of cancer cell migration was significantly reduced in PG-deficient mutant cells, or by treatment of WT cells with heparin or xyloside. We conclude that cancer cell-derived exosomes use HSPGs for their internalization and functional activity, which significantly extends the emerging role of HSPGs as key receptors of macromolecular cargo.

MicroRNAs transfer from human macrophages to hepato-carcinoma cells and inhibit proliferation.	J Immunol	2013	Recent research has indicated a new mode of intercellular communication facilitated by the movement of RNA between cells. There is evidence that RNA can transfer between cells in a multitude of ways, including in complex with proteins or lipids or in vesicles, including apoptotic bodies and exosomes. However, there remains little understanding of the function of nucleic acid transfer between human cells. In this article, we report that human macrophages transfer microRNAs (miRNAs) to hepato-carcinoma cells (HCCs) in a manner that required intercellular contact and involved gap junctions. Two specific miRNAs transferred efficiently between these cells--miR-142 and miR-223--and both were endogenously expressed in macrophages and not in HCCs. Transfer of these miRNAs influenced posttranscriptional regulation of proteins in HCCs, including decreased expression of reporter proteins and endogenously expressed stathmin-1 and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor. Importantly, transfer of miRNAs from macrophages functionally inhibited proliferation of these cancerous cells. Thus, these data led us to propose that intercellular transfer of miRNA from immune cells could serve as a new defense against unwanted cell proliferation or tumor growth.	PMC3858238

J Transl Med	2014	BACKGROUND: The role of exosomes in the pathogenesis and metastatic spread of cancer remains to be fully elucidated. Recent studies support the hypothesis that the release of exosomes from cells modifies local extracellular conditions to promote cell growth and neovascularisation. In addition, exosomes may modify the phenotype of parent and/or target cell. For example, sequestration of signaling mediators into exosomes may reduce their intracellular bioavailability to the parent cell thereby altering cell phenotype and metastatic potential. The fusion of released exosomes with target cell and delivery may also modify cell function and activity. In this study, to further elucidate the role of exosomes in ovarian cancer, the release of exosomes from two ovarian cancer cell lines of different invasive capacity and their miRNA content of exosomes were compared. The hypothesis to be tested was that ovarian cancer cell invasiveness is associated with altered release of exosomes and discordant exosomal sequestration of miRNA. METHODS: High (SKOV-3) and low (OVCAR-3) invasive ovarian cancer cell lines were used to characterize their exosome release. SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells were cultured (DMEM, 20% exosome-free FBS) under an atmosphere of 8% O2 for 24 hours. Cell-conditioned media were collected and exosomes were isolated by differential and buoyant density centrifugation and characterised by Western blot (CD63 and CD9). Exosomal microRNA (let-7a-f and miR-200a-c) content was established by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Exosomes were identified with by the presence of typical cup-shaped spherical vesicle and the expression of exosome markers: CD63, CD9. SKOV-3 cells released 2.7-fold more exosomes (1.22 ± 0.11 μg/106 cells) compared to OVCAR-3 (0.44 ± 0.05 μg/106 cells). The let-7 family miRNA transcripts were identified in both ovarian cancer cell lines and their exosomes. The let-7 family transcripts were more abundant in OVCAR-3 cell than SKOV-3 cells. In contrast, let-7 family transcripts were more abundant in exosomes from SKOV-3 than OVCAR-3. miR-200 family transcripts were only identified in OVCAR-3 cells and their exosomes. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained in this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the releases of exosomes varies significantly between ovarian cancer cell lines and correlates with their invasive potential.

BMC Genomics	2014	BACKGROUND: Breast milk contains complex nutrients and facilitates the maturation of various biological systems in infants. Exosomes, membranous vesicles of endocytic origin found in different body fluids such as milk, can mediate intercellular communication. We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of non-coding small RNAs of 18-25 nt which are known to be packaged in exosomes of human, bovine and porcine milk, may play important roles in the development of piglets. RESULTS: In this study, exosomes of approximately 100 nm in diameter were isolated from porcine milk through serial centrifugation and ultracentrifugation procedures. Total RNA was extracted from exosomes, and 5S ribosomal RNA was found to be the major RNA component. Solexa sequencing showed a total of 491 miRNAs, including 176 known miRNAs and 315 novel mature miRNAs (representing 366 pre-miRNAs), which were distributed among 30 clusters and 35 families, and two predicted novel miRNAs were verified targeting 3'UTR of IGF-1R by luciferase assay. Interestingly, we observed that three miRNAs (ssc-let-7e, ssc-miR-27a, and ssc-miR-30a) could be generated from miRNA-offset RNAs (moRNAs). The top 10 miRNAs accounted for 74.5% (67,154 counts) of total counts, which were predicted to target 2,333 genes by RNAhybrid software. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses using DAVID bioinformatics resources indicated that the identified miRNAs targeted genes enriched in transcription, immunity and metabolism processes, and 14 of the top 20 miRNAs possibly participate in regulation of the IgA immune network. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that porcine milk exosomes contain a large number of miRNAs, which potentially play an important role in information transfer from sow milk to piglets. The predicted miRNAs of porcine milk exosomes in this study provide a basis for future biochemical and biophysical function studies.	PMC4008308

The overexpression of a single oncogene (ERBB2/HER2) alters the proteomic landscape of extracellular vesicles.	Proteomics	2014	ERBB2/HER2 amplification activates signaling cascades that lead to a tumor cell phenotype. However, despite its remarkable importance in oncology, the consequences of HER2 amplification over the extracellular vesicles (EVs) content have not yet been investigated. Here, we isolated EVs secreted by HB4a, a mammary luminal epithelial cell line and C5.2, its HER2-overexpressing clone. We isolated two EV sets (20 and 100 K) by ultracentrifugation and used electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis for their morphological characterization. We employed GeLC-MS/MS combined with isotope-coded protein labeling to evaluate cell-derived proteins and LC-MS/MS label free spectral counting to quantify the EVs proteome. We found higher HER2 levels in both C5.2-derived EVs when compared with C5.2 cells, suggesting its preferential shuttling. Proteins capable of inducing malignant transformation are enriched in both C5.2 EV subsets, including two HER2-related proteins involved in cell motility and invasion, cofilin and CD44. MetaCore™ analysis indicated an enrichment of cell adhesion and cytoskeleton-remodeling pathways in C5.2 EVs, as well as proteins related to HER2 signaling, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway. Together, our data indicate that in terms of protein content, distinct vesicle sets reinforce and complement each other. Our results also suggest that HER2-upregulated proteins from EVs may be relevant for cellular malignancy and can be potential biomarkers for HER2(+) cancer patients.	
24853207	Hussein H Aly				The J6JFH1 strain of hepatitis C virus infects human B-cells with low replication efficacy.	Viral Immunol	2014	Abstract Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a serious health problem worldwide that can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma or end-stage liver disease. Current treatment with pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and NS3/4A protease inhibitor would lead to a good prognosis in a large population of patients, but there is still no effective vaccine for HCV. HCV robustly infects hepatocytes in the liver. However, extrahepatic manifestations such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, a systemic immune complex-mediated disorder characterized by B-cell proliferation, which may evolve into overt B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, have been demonstrated. HCV-RNA is often found to be associated with peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggesting a possible interaction with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), especially B-cells with HCV. B-cell HCV infection was a matter of debate for a long time, and the new advance in HCV in vitro infectious systems suggest that exosome can transmit HCV genome to support "infection." We aimed to clarify the susceptibility of primary B-cells to HCV infection, and to study its functional effect. In this article, we found that the recombinant HCV J6JFH1 strain could infect human B-cells isolated from the peripheral blood of normal volunteers by the detection of both HCV-negative-strand RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and NS5A protein. We also show the blocking of HCV replication by type I interferon after B-cell HCV infection. Although HCV replication in B-lymphocytes showed lower efficiency, in comparison with hepatocyte line (Huh7) cells, our results clearly demonstrate that human B-lymphocytes without other non-B-cells can actually be infected with HCV, and that this interaction leads to the induction of B-cells' innate immune response, and change the response of these cells to apoptosis.

Stem Cell Reports	2014	The CADUCEUS trial of cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) has shown that it may be possible to regenerate injured heart muscle previously thought to be permanently scarred. The mechanisms of benefit are known to be indirect, but the mediators have yet to be identified. Here we pinpoint exosomes secreted by human CDCs as critical agents of regeneration and cardioprotection. CDC exosomes inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation of cardiomyocytes, while enhancing angiogenesis. Injection of exosomes into injured mouse hearts recapitulates the regenerative and functional effects produced by CDC transplantation, whereas inhibition of exosome production by CDCs blocks those benefits. CDC exosomes contain a distinctive complement of microRNAs, with particular enrichment of miR-146a. Selective administration of a miR-146a mimic reproduces some (but not all) of the benefits of CDC exosomes. The findings identify exosomes as key mediators of CDC-induced regeneration, while highlighting the potential utility of exosomes as cell-free therapeutic candidates.	PMC4050492

Immunology	2015	Soluble MHCII (sMHCII) molecules are present in body fluids of healthy individuals and are considered to be involved in the maintenance of self tolerance, and are also related to various diseases. Their concentration increases during in vivo antigen-specific tolerogenic stimulation and it was recently shown that exosome-mediated tolerance is MHCII dependent. At the cellular level, sMHCII proteins compete with membrane MHCII for T-cell receptor binding on CD4(+) T cells. Immunoaffinity purification techniques isolated sMHCII antigens from the serum of human serum albumin (HSA) -tolerant mice as a single highly glycosylated protein of ~ 60,000 molecular weight, specifically interacting with anti-class II antibodies in Western blotting and ELISA. Mass spectroscopy showed that these sMHCII proteins were loaded with the tolerogenic peptide as well as multiple self peptides. At the cellular level, sMHCII suppressed antigen-specific, and to a lesser degree antigen-non-specific, spleen cell proliferation and induced CD25 in naive T cells. In T cells activated by antigen-seeded macrophages, sMHCII decreased CD28 and increased CTLA-4 protein expression, while decreasing interleukin-2 and increasing interleukin-10 production. In this case, sMHCII proteins were shown to decrease ZAP-70 and LAT phosphorylation. The results presented here for the first time provide evidence for the role of sMHCII proteins in immune response suppression and maintenance of tolerance, revealing novel regulatory mechanisms for immune system manipulation.

Curr Protein Pept Sci	2014	Two far-reaching theoretical approaches, namely "Neuro-semeiotics" (NS) and "Free-energy Minimization" (FEM), have been recently proposed as frames within which to put forward heuristic hypotheses on integrative brain actions. In the present paper these two theoretical approaches are briefly discussed in the perspective of a recent model of brain architecture and information handling based on what we suggest calling Jacob's tinkering principle, whereby "to create is to recombine!". The NS and FEM theoretical approaches will be discussed from the perspective both of the Roamer-Type Volume Transmission (especially exosome-mediated) of intercellular communication and of the impact of receptor oligomers and Receptor-Receptor Interactions (RRIs) on signal recognition/decoding processes. In particular, the Bio-semeiotics concept of "adaptor" will be used to analyze RRIs as an important feature of NS. Furthermore, the concept of phenotypic plasticity of cells will be introduced in view of the demonstration of the possible transfer of receptors (i.e., adaptors) into a computational network via exosomes (see also Appendix). Thus, Jacob's tinkering principle will be proposed as a theoretical basis for some learning processes both at the network level (Turing-like type of machine) and at the molecular level as a consequence of both the plastic changes in the adaptors caused by the allosteric interactions in the receptor oligomers and the intercellular transfer of receptors. Finally, on the basis of NS and FEM theories, a unified perspective for integrative brain actions will be proposed.

Urinary exosomes: a novel means to non-invasively assess changes in renal gene and protein expression.	PLoS One	2014	BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, there is a lack of markers for the non-invasive diagnosis and follow-up of kidney disease. Exosomes are membrane vesicles, which are secreted from their cells of origin into surrounding body fluids and contain proteins and mRNA which are protected from digestive enzymes by a cell membrane. METHODS: Toxic podocyte damage was induced by puromycin aminonucleoside in rats (PAN). Urinary exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation at different time points during the disease. Exosomal mRNA was isolated, amplified, and the mRNA species were globally assessed by gene array analysis. Tissue-specific gene and protein expression was assessed by RT-qPCR analysis and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Gene array analysis of mRNA isolated from urinary exosomes revealed cystatin C mRNA as one of the most highly regulated genes. Its gene expression increased 7.5-fold by day 5 and remained high with a 1.9-fold increase until day 10. This was paralleled by a 2-fold increase in cystatin C mRNA expression in the renal cortex. Protein expression in the kidneys also dramatically increased with de novo expression of cystatin C in glomerular podocytes in parts of the proximal tubule and the renal medulla. Urinary excretion of cystatin C increased approximately 2-fold. CONCLUSION: In this proof-of-concept study, we could demonstrate that changes in urinary exosomal cystatin C mRNA expression are representative of changes in renal mRNA and protein expression. Because cells lining the urinary tract produce urinary exosomal cystatin C mRNA, it might be a more specific marker of renal damage than glomerular-filtered free cystatin C.	PMC4195685

Increased DJ-1 in urine exosome of Korean males with Parkinson's disease.	Biomed Res Int	2014	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a difficult disease to diagnose although it is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies show that exosome isolated from urine contains LRRK2 or DJ-1, proteins whose mutations cause PD. To investigate a potential use for urine exosomes as a tool for PD diagnosis, we compared levels of LRRK2, α-synuclein, and DJ-1 in urine exosomes isolated from Korean PD patients and non-PD controls. LRRK2 and DJ-1, but not α-synuclein, were detected in the urine exosome samples, as reported previously. We initially could not detect any significant difference in these protein levels between the patient and the control groups. However, when age, disease duration, L-dopa daily dose, and gender were considered as analytical parameters, LRRK2 and DJ-1 protein levels showed clear gender-dependent differences. In addition, DJ-1 level was significantly higher (1.7-fold) in male patients with PD than that in male non-PD controls and increased in an age-dependent manner in male patients with PD. Our observation might provide a clue to lead to a novel biomarker for PD diagnosis, at least in males.	PMC4247948

Exosomal Hsp70 mediates immunosuppressive activity of the myeloid-derived suppressor cells via phosphorylation of Stat3.	Med Oncol	2015	Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), one of the main cell populations, are responsible for regulating the immune response, which accumulates in tumor-bearing mice and humans contributing to cancer development. Exosomes produced by tumor cells have been involved in tumor-associated immune suppression. However, the role of exosomes is unclear in the activation of MDSCs. Here, we have purified tumor-derived exosomes from the supernatants of Renca cell cultures. Transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm their morphology, and Western blot analysis showed that Hsp70 was rich in these isolated exosomes compared with the whole-cell lysates of Renca cells. Then, we demonstrated that there was a more powerful activity of exosomal Hsp70-mediated induction of proinflammation cytokines, tumor growth factors of MDSCs and tumor progression than exosomes pre-incubated with anti-Hsp70 antibody. Furthermore, we show that an interactive exosomal HSP70 and MDSCs determine the suppressive activity of the MDSCs via phosphorylation of Stat3 (p-Stat3). Finally, we show that exosomal Hsp70 triggers p-Stat3 in MDSCs in a TLR2-MyD88-dependent manner. Meanwhile, we also find that there is a more significant increase in the percentage of CD11b+Gr-1+ cells in the mice, which are treated with exosomal Hsp70 than that exosomes pre-incubated with anti-Hsp70 antibody. Hence, we believe that the signaling pathway activation by exosomal Hsp70 within MDSCs may be a significant target in future treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

Macrophages play an essential role in antigen-specific immune suppression mediated by T CD8⁺ cell-derived exosomes.	Immunology	2015	Murine contact sensitivity (CS) reaction could be antigen-specifically regulated by T CD8(+) suppressor (Ts) lymphocytes releasing microRNA-150 in antibody light-chain-coated exosomes that were formerly suggested to suppress CS through action on macrophages (Mφ). The present studies investigated the role of Mφ in Ts cell-exosome-mediated antigen-specific suppression as well as modulation of Mφ antigen-presenting function in humoral and cellular immunity by suppressive exosomes. Mice depleted of Mφ by clodronate liposomes could not be tolerized and did not produce suppressive exosomes. Moreover, isolated T effector lymphocytes transferring CS were suppressed by exosomes only in the presence of Mφ, demonstrating the substantial role of Mφ in the generation and action of Ts cell regulatory exosomes. Further, significant decrease of number of splenic B cells producing trinitrophenyl (TNP) -specific antibodies with the alteration of the ratio of serum titres of IgM to IgG was observed in recipients of exosome-treated, antigen-pulsed Mφ and the significant suppression of CS was demonstrated in recipients of exosome-treated, TNP-conjugated Mφ. Additionally, exosome-pulsed, TNP-conjugated Mφ mediated suppression of CS in mice pre-treated with a low-dose of cyclophosphamide, suggesting de novo induction of T regulatory (Treg) lymphocytes. Treg cell involvement in the effector phase of the studied suppression mechanism was proved by unsuccessful tolerization of DEREG mice depleted of Treg lymphocytes. Furthermore, the inhibition of proliferation of CS effector cells cultured with exosome-treated Mφ in a transmembrane manner was observed. Our results demonstrated the essential role of Mφ in antigen-specific immune suppression mediated by Ts cell-derived exosomes and realized by induction of Treg lymphocytes and inhibition of T effector cell proliferation.

Free Extracellular miRNA Functionally Targets Cells by Transfecting Exosomes from Their Companion Cells.	PLoS One	2015	Lymph node and spleen cells of mice doubly immunized by epicutaneous and intravenous hapten application produce a suppressive component that inhibits the action of the effector T cells that mediate contact sensitivity reactions. We recently re-investigated this phenomenon in an immunological system. CD8+ T lymphocyte-derived exosomes transferred suppressive miR-150 to the effector T cells antigen-specifically due to exosome surface coat of antibody light chains made by B1a lymphocytes. Extracellular RNA (exRNA) is protected from plasma RNases by carriage in exosomes or by chaperones. Exosome transfer of functional RNA to target cells is well described, whereas the mechanism of transfer of exRNA free of exosomes remains unclear. In the current study we describe extracellular miR-150, extracted from exosomes, yet still able to mediate antigen-specific suppression. We have determined that this was due to miR-150 association with antibody-coated exosomes produced by B1a cell companions of the effector T cells, which resulted in antigen-specific suppression of their function. Thus functional cell targeting by free exRNA can proceed by transfecting companion cell exosomes that then transfer RNA cargo to the acceptor cells. This contrasts with the classical view on release of RNA-containing exosomes from the multivesicular bodies for subsequent intercellular targeting. This new alternate pathway for transfer of exRNA between cells has distinct biological and immunological significance, and since most human blood exRNA is not in exosomes may be relevant to evaluation and treatment of diseases.

Contribution of microRNAs in understanding the pancreatic tumor microenvironment involving cancer associated stellate and fibroblast cells.	Am J Cancer Res	2015	Understanding of molecular events associated with tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer (PC) is an active area of research especially because of the rich desmoplasia seen in human PC. Desmoplasia is contributed by several cell types including cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and stellate cells (PSCs), which are believed to play critical roles in conferring aggressiveness to PC. The aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in PSCs and CAF cells appears to play a pivotal role in the development and progression of PC. In this study, expression analysis of miR-21/miR-221 in conditioned media derived from PSCs/CAF cells, and from PSCs/CAF cells showed up-regulation of both miRNAs compared to MIAPaCa-2 PC cells. In addition, miR-21 expression in stellate cells derived from normal pancreas was substantially lower when compared to PSCs or CAF cells. COLO-357 PC cells cultured in the presence of conditioned media derived from PSC/CAF cells led to a significant increase in clonogenicity and pancreatosphere formation. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-21 with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) transfection resulted in decreased migration/invasive capacity of PSCs. Similarly, the effect of ASO-miR-221 transfection in CAF cells reduced the expression of NF-κB and K-Ras (target of miR-221) along with inhibition of migration/invasion. Moreover, miRNA expression profiling of PSCs, MIAPaCa-2, and COLO-357 cells, and further validation by real-time PCR, showed several differentially expressed miRNAs, among which four was significantly up-regulated. Collectively, these results suggest a crosstalk between PSCs/CAF cells and PC cells, resulting in the up-regulation of miR-21/miR-221 expression which in part may confer aggressiveness to PC. We conclude that targeting these miRNAs could be useful for developing precision medicine for the prevention of tumor progression and/or for the treatment of PC.	PMC4449452

Umbilical cord blood-derived dendritic cells loaded with BGC823 tumor antigens and DC-derived exosomes stimulate efficient cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses and antitumor immunity in vitro and in vivo.	Cent Eur J Immunol	2014	BACKGROUND: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a rich source of hematopoietic stem cells and from which a significant number of dendritic cells (DCs) can be produced. But the therapeutic role of DCs and exosomes (EXO) generated from DCs is not fully elucidated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The UCB-derived DCs were loaded with tumor antigens generated from BGC823 cell line. Exosomes were derived from these DCs by ultracentrifugation. Dendritic cells and DCex were evaluated by light microscope, transmission electron microscope (TEM), flow cytometry, and western blot assay. The therapeutic role of DCs and EXO generated from DCs were then detected in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Dendritic cells isolated from umbilical cord blood after loading with tumor antigens generated from BGC823 cell line could express high levels of protein molecules: MHC-I, MHC-II, CD34, CD40, CD80, CD86, CD11c and CD54 and mediate a stronger promotion of T cells proliferation. And, they could also enhance the cytotoxicity effects of the generated CTL in vitro and in vivo. Exosomes isolated from these DCs were 40-90-nm round particles with a complete membrane structure and could also expressed molecules similar to DCs. Exosomes could stimulate T cell proliferation, produce effective cytotoxicity and induce more efficient in vivo antitumor immunity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that tumor antigens loaded DCs derived from unrelated umbilical cord blood or DCex can induce tumor specific cytotoxicity and this may represent a novel immunotherapy for tumors. Because of their advantage of stable, easy to store, DCex have a more brilliant prospects in the tumor immunity. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: We reported that exosomes derived from umbilical cord blood dendritic cell (UBDC), similar to DCs, can trigger activation of T cells significantly. These data demonstrate that DC-derived exosomes (DCex) can mediate essential adaptive immune functions.	PMC4440031

J Am Coll Cardiol	2015	BACKGROUND: Cardiosphere-derived cells mediate therapeutic regeneration in patients after myocardial infarction and are undergoing further clinical testing for cardiomyopathy. The beneficial effects of cardiosphere-derived cells are mediated by the secretion of exosomes and possibly other extracellular membrane vesicles (EMVs). OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the effect of cardiosphere-derived EMVs (CSp-EMVs) on fibroblasts in vitro and tested whether priming with CSp-EMVs could confer salutary properties on fibroblasts in vivo. METHODS: CSp-EMVs were isolated from serum-free media conditioned for 3 days by cardiospheres. Dermal fibroblasts were primed with CSp-EMVs for 24 h followed by exosomal micro-ribonucleic acid profiling. In vivo, we injected CSp-EMV-primed or -unprimed dermal fibroblasts (or CSp-EMVs) in a chronic rat model of myocardial infarction and defined the functional and structural consequences. RESULTS: CSp-EMVs amplified their own biological signals: exposure of "inert" fibroblasts to CSp-EMVs rendered the fibroblasts therapeutic. Intramyocardially injected CSp-EMV-primed (but not unprimed) fibroblasts increased global pump function and vessel density while reducing scar mass. CSp-EMV priming caused fibroblasts to secrete much higher levels of stromal-cell-derived factor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor and dramatically changed the micro-ribonucleic acid profile of fibroblast-secreted EMVs in vitro. The priming was followed by significant angiogenic and cardioprotective effects. CONCLUSIONS: CSp-EMVs alter fibroblast phenotype and secretome in a salutary positive-feedback loop. The phenotypic conversion of inert cells to therapeutically active cells reveals a novel mechanism for amplification of exosome bioactivity.	PMC4593504

RNA	2015	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been proposed as a means to promote intercellular communication. We show that when human primary cells are exposed to cancer cell EVs, rapid cell death of the primary cells is observed, while cancer cells treated with primary or cancer cell EVs do not display this response. The active agents that trigger cell death are 29- to 31-nucleotide (nt) or 22- to 23-nt processed fragments of an 83-nt primary transcript of the human RNY5 gene that are highly likely to be formed within the EVs. Primary cells treated with either cancer cell EVs, deproteinized total RNA from either primary or cancer cell EVs, or synthetic versions of 31- and 23-nt fragments trigger rapid cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The transfer of processed RNY5 fragments through EVs may reflect a novel strategy used by cancer cells toward the establishment of a favorable microenvironment for their proliferation and invasion.

Hallmarks of HIV-1 pathogenesis are modulated by Nef's Secretion Modification Region.	J AIDS Clin Res	2015	CD4+ T cell depletion and immune activation are hallmarks of HIV infection. Despite extensive studies, the mechanisms underlying immune modulation remain elusive. HIV-1 Nef protein is secreted in exosomes from infected cells and is abundant in the plasma of HIV+ individuals. Exosomal Nef (exNef) was also shown to induce apoptosis in bystander CD4+ T cells. We hypothesized that exNef contributes to HIV pathogenesis. A HIV-1 NL4-3 virus containing alanine substitutions in the secretion modification region (SMR; amino acids 66 to 70; HIVNefsmr5a) was developed. Nef protein containing this modified SMR was shown to be deficient in exNef secretion in nef-transfected cells. Using both HIV-1 NL4-3 wild type (HIVwt) and HIVNefsmr5a, correlates of pathogenesis were evaluated in cell-lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and humanized NOD-RAG1-/- IL2r-/- double mutant (NRG) mice. Disruption of the SMR did not affect viral replication or exNef secretion from infected cell cultures as compared with nef-transfected cells. However, T cell apoptosis was reduced in HIVNefsmr5a infected cell cultures and CD4+ T cell depletion was reduced in the spleen and peripheral blood of similarly infected NRG mice. Inflammatory cytokine release was also decreased in the sera of HIVNefsmr5a infected mice relative to HIVwt infected controls. These findings demonstrate the importance of Nef and the SMR motif in HIV pathogenesis and suggest a potential role for exNef in HIV-driven immune modulation.	PMC4625552

J Hepatol	2016	BACKGROUND & AIMS: The mechanisms by which hepatocyte exposure to alcohol activates inflammatory cells such as macrophages in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) are unclear. The role of released nano-sized membrane vesicles, termed extracellular vesicles (EV), in cell-to-cell communication has become increasingly recognized. We tested the hypothesis that hepatocytes exposed to alcohol may increase EV release to elicit macrophage activation. METHODS: Primary hepatocytes or HepG2 hepatocyte cell lines overexpressing ethanol-metabolizing enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (HepG2(ADH)) or cytochrome P450 2E1 (HepG2(Cyp2E1)) were treated with ethanol and EV release was quantified with nanoparticle tracking analysis. EV mediated macrophage activation was monitored by analysing inflammatory cytokines and macrophage associated mRNA expression, immunohistochemistry, biochemical serum alanine aminotransferase and triglycerides analysis in our in vitro macrophage activation and in vivo murine ethanol feeding studies. RESULTS: Ethanol significantly increased EV release by 3.3-fold from HepG2(Cyp2E1) cells and was associated with activation of caspase-3. Blockade of caspase activation with pharmacological or genetic approaches abrogated alcohol-induced EV release. EV stimulated macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine induction. An unbiased microarray-based approach and antibody neutralization experiments demonstrated a critical role of CD40 ligand (CD40L) in EV mediated macrophage activation. In vivo, wild-type mice receiving a pan-caspase, Rho kinase inhibitor or with genetic deletion of CD40 (CD40(-/-)) or the caspase-activating TRAIL receptor (TR(-/-)), were protected from alcohol-induced injury and associated macrophage infiltration. Moreover, serum from patients with alcoholic hepatitis showed increased levels of CD40L enriched EV. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, hepatocytes release CD40L containing EV in a caspase-dependent manner in response to alcohol exposure which promotes macrophage activation, contributing to inflammation in ALD.

Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol	2016	MicroRNAs (miRs) are small conserved RNA that regulate gene expression. Bioinformatic analysis of miRNA profiles during mouse lung development indicated a role for multiple miRNA, including miRNA-489. miR-489 increased on completion of alveolar septation [postnatal day 42 (P42)], associated with decreases in its conserved target genes insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1) and tenascin C (Tnc). We hypothesized that dysregulation of miR-489 and its target genes Igf1 and Tnc contribute to hyperoxia-induced abnormal lung development. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to normoxia (21%) or hyperoxia (85% O2) from P4 to P14, in combination with intranasal locked nucleic acid against miR-489 to inhibit miR-489, cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV)-miR-489 to overexpress miR-489, or empty vector. Hyperoxia reduced miR-489 and increased Igf1 and Tnc. Locked nucleic acid against miR-489 improved lung development during hyperoxia and did not alter it during normoxia, whereas miR-489 overexpression inhibited lung development during normoxia. The 3' untranslated region in vitro reporter studies confirmed Igf1 and Tnc as targets of miR-489. While miR-489 was of epithelial origin and present in exosomes, its targets Igf1 and Tnc were produced by fibroblasts. Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) had reduced lung miR-489 and increased Igf1 and Tnc compared with normal preterm or term infants. These results suggest increased miR-489 is an inhibitor of alveolar septation. During hyperoxia or BPD, reduced miR-489 and increased Igf1 and Tnc may be inadequate attempts at compensation. Further inhibition of miR-489 may permit alveolar septation to proceed. The use of specific miRNA antagonists or agonists may be a therapeutic strategy for inhibited alveolarization, such as in BPD.

Exosome-associated AAV vector as a robust and convenient neuroscience tool.	Gene Ther	2016	Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are showing promise in gene therapy trials and have proven to be extremely efficient biological tools in basic neuroscience research. One major limitation to their widespread use in the neuroscience laboratory is the cost, labor, skill and time-intense purification process of AAV. We have recently shown that AAV can associate with exosomes (exo-AAV) when the vector is isolated from conditioned media of producer cells, and the exo-AAV is more resistant to neutralizing anti-AAV antibodies compared with standard AAV. Here, we demonstrate that simple pelleting of exo-AAV from media via ultracentrifugation results in high-titer vector preparations capable of efficient transduction of central nervous system (CNS) cells after systemic injection in mice. We observed that exo-AAV is more efficient at gene delivery to the brain at low vector doses relative to conventional AAV, even when derived from a serotype that does not normally efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier. Similar cell types were transduced by exo-AAV and conventionally purified vector. Importantly, no cellular toxicity was noted in exo-AAV-transduced cells. We demonstrated the utility and robustness of exo-AAV-mediated gene delivery by detecting direct GFP fluorescence after systemic injection, allowing three-dimensional reconstruction of transduced Purkinje cells in the cerebellum using ex vivo serial two-photon tomography. The ease of isolation combined with the high efficiency of transgene expression in the CNS, may enable the widespread use of exo-AAV as a neuroscience research tool. Furthermore, the ability of exo-AAV to evade neutralizing antibodies while still transducing CNS after peripheral delivery is clinically relevant.	PMC4824662

Presence of Viral RNA and Proteins in Exosomes from Cellular Clones Resistant to Rift Valley Fever Virus Infection.	Front Microbiol	2016	Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) is a RNA virus that belongs to the genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae. It infects humans and livestock and causes Rift Valley fever. RVFV is considered an agricultural pathogen by the USDA, as it can cause up to 100% abortion in cattle and extensive death of newborns. In addition, it is designated as Category A pathogen by the CDC and the NIAID. In some human cases of RVFV infection, the virus causes fever, ocular damage, liver damage, hemorrhagic fever, and death. There are currently limited options for vaccine candidates, which include the MP-12 and clone 13 versions of RVFV. Viral infections often deregulate multiple cellular pathways that contribute to replication and host pathology. We have previously shown that latent human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) infected cells secrete exosomes that contain short viral RNAs, limited number of genomic RNAs, and viral proteins. These exosomes largely target neighboring cells and activate the NF-κB pathway, leading to cell proliferation, and overall better viral replication. In this manuscript, we studied the effects of exosome formation from RVFV infected cells and their function on recipient cells. We initially infected cells, isolated resistant clones, and further purified using dilution cloning. We then characterized these cells as resistant to new RVFV infection, but sensitive to other viral infections, including Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV). These clones contained normal markers (i.e., CD63) for exosomes and were able to activate the TLR pathway in recipient reporter cells. Interestingly, the exosome rich preparations, much like their host cell, contained viral RNA (L, M, and S genome). The RNAs were detected using qRT-PCR in both parental and exosomal preparations as well as in CD63 immunoprecipitates. Viral proteins such as N and a modified form of NSs were present in some of these exosomes. Finally, treatment of recipient cells (T-cells and monocytic cells) showed drastic rate of apoptosis through PARP cleavage and caspase 3 activation from some but not all exosome enriched preparations. Collectively, these data suggest that exosomes from RVFV infected cells alter the dynamics of the immune cells and may contribute to pathology of the viral infection.	PMC4749701

Exosomes Derived from Squamous Head and Neck Cancer Promote Cell Survival after Ionizing Radiation.	PLoS One	2016	Exosomes are nanometer-sized extracellular vesicles that are believed to function as intercellular communicators. Here, we report that exosomes are able to modify the radiation response of the head and neck cancer cell lines BHY and FaDu. Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned medium of irradiated as well as non-irradiated head and neck cancer cells by serial centrifugation. Quantification using NanoSight technology indicated an increased exosome release from irradiated compared to non-irradiated cells 24 hours after treatment. To test whether the released exosomes influence the radiation response of other cells the exosomes were transferred to non-irradiated and irradiated recipient cells. We found an enhanced uptake of exosomes isolated from both irradiated and non-irradiated cells by irradiated recipient cells compared to non-irradiated recipient cells. Functional analyses by exosome transfer indicated that all exosomes (from non-irradiated and irradiated donor cells) increase the proliferation of non-irradiated recipient cells and the survival of irradiated recipient cells. The survival-promoting effects are more pronounced when exosomes isolated from irradiated compared to non-irradiated donor cells are transferred. A possible mechanism for the increased survival after irradiation could be the increase in DNA double-strand break repair monitored at 6, 8 and 10 h after the transfer of exosomes isolated from irradiated cells. This is abrogated by the destabilization of the exosomes. Our results demonstrate that radiation influences both the abundance and action of exosomes on recipient cells. Exosomes transmit prosurvival effects by promoting the proliferation and radioresistance of head and neck cancer cells. Taken together, this study indicates a functional role of exosomes in the response of tumor cells to radiation exposure within a therapeutic dose range and encourages that exosomes are useful objects of study for a better understanding of tumor radiation response.

Neutrophil-Derived Exosomes: A New Mechanism Contributing to Airway Smooth Muscle Remodeling.	Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol	2016	Neutrophils infiltrate the airways of patients with asthma of all severities, yet their role in the pathogenesis of asthma and their contribution to airway remodeling is largely unknown. We hypothesized that neutrophils modulate airway smooth muscle (ASM) proliferation in asthma by releasing bioactive exosomes. These newly discovered nano-sized vesicles have the capacity to modulate immune responses, cell migration, cell differentiation, and other aspects of cell-to-cell communication. The aim of the study is to determine whether bioactive exosomes are released by neutrophils, and, if so, characterize their proteomic profile and evaluate their capacity to modulate ASM cell proliferation. Exosomes were isolated from equine neutrophil supernatants by differential centrifugation and filtration methods, followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Nanovesicles were characterized using electron microscopy, particle size determination, and proteomic analyses. Exosomes were cocultured with ASM cells and analyzed for exosome internalization by confocal microscopy. ASM proliferation was measured using an impedance-based system. Neutrophils release exosomes that have characteristic size, morphology, and exosomal markers. We identified 271 proteins in exosomes from both LPS and unstimulated neutrophils, and 16 proteins that were differentially expressed, which carried proteins associated with immune response and positive regulation of cell communication. Furthermore, neutrophil-derived exosomes were rapidly internalized by ASM cells and altered their proliferative properties. Upon stimulation of LPS, neutrophil-derived exosomes can enhance the proliferation of ASM cells and could therefore play an important role in the progression of asthma and promoting airway remodeling in severe and corticosteroid-insensitive patients with asthma.

Epithelial ovarian cancer-secreted exosomal miR-222-3p induces polarization of tumor-associated macrophages.	Oncotarget	2016	Cancer secreted exosomal miRNAs are emerging as mediators between tumor-stoma crosstalk. Here, we show epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)-derived exosomes activated macrophages to a tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-like phenotype with SOCS3/STAT3 pathway involvement, which could facilitate the progression of cancer. MiR-222-3p was enrichment in exosomes released from EOC cells and it could be transferred to macrophages. Overexpression of miR-222-3p in macrophages induced polarization of the M2 phenotype. Luciferase assay verified miR-222-3p targeted SOCS3 genes and expression of SOCS3 was decreased after transfection with a miR-222-3p mimic. Down-regulation of SOCS3 correlated with an increased expression of STAT3 activation. MiR-222-3p could be detected in the exosomes from serum and its levels were related to EOC. These observations propose tumor-derived exosomal miR-222-3p is an effective regulator in the polarization of tumor-promoting M2 macrophages and may be a biomarker of EOC.	PMC5190009

Viral oncomiR spreading between B and T cells is employed by Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus to induce non-cell-autonomous target gene regulation.	Oncotarget	2016	The two human lymphotrophic γ-herpesviruses, Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are a recognized cause of human cancer, encoding multiple miRs that are major players in carcinogenesis. Previously, we discovered that EBV-encoded miRs transfer between infected B and T lymphocytes. To further explore the biological significance of the spreading of γ-herpesvirus-encoded miRs on carcinogenesis, we focused on KSHV-miR-K12-11 (miR-K12-11) that is unique in having an identical seed sequence with the oncomiR hsa-miR-155, implicated in B cell lymphomas development. Here, we show for the first time that miR-K12-11 transfers in vitro from KSHV-infected BCBL-1 and BC-1 lymphoma lines to T cells. The transferred miR-K12-11 is active in the adopting T cells and binds its canonical target, the 3'-UTR of BACH1. Importantly, we show that the transfer of miR-K12-11 from BCBL-1 to Jurkat cells correlates with inhibition of the innate type-I interferons response to viral dsRNAs downstream of IKKε, a validated miR-K12-11 target. Finally, we show that miR-K12-11 spreading is not reduced by blocking the classical ceramide-dependent exosome secretion pathway. In summary, we report for the first time that intercellular viral oncomiR spreading is an additional mechanism employed by KSHV to inhibit host anti-viral immunity and consequently promote oncogenesis.

Exosome-mediated transfer from the tumor microenvironment increases TGFβ signaling in squamous cell carcinoma.	Am J Transl Res	2016	Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signaling in cancer is context dependent and acts either as a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter. Loss of function mutation in TGFβ type II receptor (TβRII) is a frequent event in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Recently, heterogeneity of TGFβ response has been described at the leading edge of SCC and this heterogeneity has been shown to influence stem cell renewal and drug resistance. Because exosome transfer from stromal to breast cancer cells regulates therapy resistance pathways we investigated whether exosomes contain components of the TGFβ signaling pathway and whether exosome transfer between stromal fibroblasts and tumor cells can influence TGFβ signaling in SCC. We demonstrate that exosomes purified from stromal fibroblasts isolated from patients with oral SCC contains TβRII. We also demonstrate that transfer of fibroblast exosomes increases TGFβ signaling in SCC keratinocytes devoid of TβRII which remain non-responsive to TGFβ ligand in the absence of exosome transfer. Overall our data show that stromal communication with tumor cells can direct TGFβ signaling in SCC.	PMC4891457

J Dermatol Sci	2016	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are small vesicles shed from various cells. They contain proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, and are regarded as a tool of cell-cell communication. OBJECTIVES: To reveal the putative role of exosomes in systemic sclerosis (SSc), and to elucidate the effect of exosomes on wound healing. METHODS: The expression of common markers for exosomes (CD63, CD9, and CD81) and type I collagen were examined with real-time PCR, immunohistochemical analysis, ELISA, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry. The effect of serum-derived exosomes on wound healing was tested on full-thickness wounds in the mid-dorsal skin of BALB/c mice. RESULTS: The expression levels of CD63 as well as CD9 and CD81 tended to be increased in SSc dermal fibroblasts compared to normal fibroblasts. Increased exosomes in a cultured media of SSc fibroblasts stimulated the expression levels of type I collagen in normal fibroblasts. As the mechanism, collagen-related microRNA levels in SSc fibroblast-derived exosomes were dysregulated, indicating that both the amount and the content of exosomes were altered in SSc. On the other hand, SSc sera showed significantly decreased exosome levels compared to normal sera. The frequencies of vascular involvements, including skin ulcers or pitting scars, were significantly increased in patients with decreased serum exosome levels. The healing of mice wounds was accelerated by treatment with serum-derived exosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular abnormalities in SSc may account for the decreased serum exosome levels by the disturbed transfer of exosomes from the skin tissue to the blood stream. Our study suggests the possibility that SSc patients with vascular involvements have decreased serum exosome levels, which causes the delay of wound healing due to down-regulation of collagen, resulting in higher susceptibility to pitting scars and/or ulcers. Exosome research will lead to a detailed understanding of SSc pathogenesis and new therapeutic approaches.

Traumatic brain injury increases levels of miR-21 in extracellular vesicles: implications for neuroinflammation.	FEBS Open Bio	2016	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important health concern and effective treatment strategies remain elusive. Understanding the complex multicellular response to TBI may provide new avenues for intervention. In the context of TBI, cell-cell communication is critical. One relatively unexplored form of cell-cell communication in TBI is extracellular vesicles (EVs). These membrane-bound vesicles can carry many different types of cargo between cells. Recently, miRNA in EVs have been shown to mediate neuroinflammation and neuronal injury. To explore the role of EV-associated miRNA in TBI, we isolated EVs from the brain of injured mice and controls, purified RNA from brain EVs, and performed miRNA sequencing. We found that the expression of miR-212 decreased, while miR-21, miR-146, miR-7a, and miR-7b were significantly increased with injury, with miR-21 showing the largest change between conditions. The expression of miR-21 in the brain was primarily localized to neurons near the lesion site. Interestingly, adjacent to these miR-21-expressing neurons were activated microglia. The concurrent increase in miR-21 in EVs with the elevation of miR-21 in neurons, suggests that miR-21 is secreted from neurons as potential EV cargo. Thus, this study reveals a new potential mechanism of cell-cell communication not previously described in TBI.	PMC4971839

Electronic address: .	proteomes@hotmail.com		Exosomal proteome analysis of cerebrospinal fluid detects biosignatures of neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis.	Clin Chim Acta	2016	Quantitative proteomic analysis of exosomes isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients detected signature proteins differentiating NMO from multiple sclerosis (MS) and idiopathic longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. Exosomes with good yields were obtained using ultracentrifugation from pooled CSF assisted by chemokine-based clustering strategy, which improved target molecule identification by providing amplified fold change values. 442 significant proteins generated a list of signature molecules of diseases validated primarily by the identification of known markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and fibronectin specific to NMO and MS respectively. MetaCore pathway analysis of significant proteins supported the involvement of these proteins in disease progression via neurological pathway. Expression levels of target molecules from orthogonal label-free quantification employing quadrupole-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometry were in good agreement with those from Western blotting. Additional investigation of GFAP and fibronectin as representative disease molecules revealed their presence in intact exosomes as detected by flow cytometry. This comprehensive study suggests that the exosomal proteomic analysis of CSF can be applied to the identification and characterization of inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system.

Inflammasome-Derived Exosomes Activate NF-κB Signaling in Macrophages.	J Proteome Res	2017	Exosomes are secreted small vesicles that mediate various biological processes, such as tumorigenesis and immune response. However, whether the inflammasome signaling leads to the change of constituent of exosomes and its roles in immune response remains to be determined. We isolated the exosomes from macrophages with treatment of mock, endotoxin, or endotoxin/nigericin. A label-free quantification method by MS/MS was used to identify the components of exosomes. In total, 2331 proteins were identified and 513 proteins were exclusively detected in exosomes with endotoxin and nigericin treatment. The differentially expressed proteins were classified by Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways. The immune response-related proteins and signaling pathways were specifically enriched in inflammasome-derived exosomes. Moreover, we treated macrophages with the exosomes from different stimulation. We found that inflammasome-derived exosomes directly activate NF-κB signaling pathway, while the control or endotoxin-derived exosomes have no effect. The inflammatory signaling was amplified in neighbor cells in an exosome-dependent way. The inflammasome-derived exosomes might be used to augment the immune response in disease treatment, and preventing the transfer of these exosomes might ameliorate autoimmune diseases.

Screening of exosomal microRNAs from colorectal cancer cells.	Cancer Biomark	2016	BACKGROUND: Cells release extracellular membrane vesicles including microvesicles known as exosomes. Exosomes contain microRNAs (miRNAs) however the full range within colorectal cancer cell secreted exosomes is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify the full range of exosome encapsulated miRNAs secreted from 2 colorectal cancer cell lines and to investigate engineering of exosomes over-expressing miRNAs. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from HCT-116 and HT-29 cell lines. RNA was extracted from exosomes and microRNA array performed. Cells were engineered to express miR-379 (HCT-116-379) or a non-targeting control (HCT-116-NTC) and functional effects were determined. Exosomes secreted by engineered cells were transferred to recipient cells and the impact examined. RESULTS: Microvesicles 40-100 nm in size secreted by cell lines were visualised and confirmed to express exosomal protein CD63. HT-29 exosomes contained 409 miRNAs, HCT-116 exosomes contained 393, and 338 were common to exosomes from both cell lines. Selected targets were validated. HCT-116-379 cells showed decreased proliferation (12-15% decrease, p < 0.001) and decreased migration (32-86% decrease, p < 0.001) compared to controls. HCT-116-379 exosomes were enriched for miR-379. Confocal microscopy visualised transfer of HCT-116-379 exosomes to recipient cells. CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal cancer cells secrete a large number of miRNAs within exosomes. miR-379 decreases cell proliferation and migration, and miR-379 enriched exosomes can be engineered.

Exosomal long noncoding RNA CRNDE-h as a novel serum-based biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of colorectal cancer.	Oncotarget	2016	Cancer-secreted long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging mediators of cancer-host cross talk. The aim of our study was to illustrate the clinical significance of the lncRNA CRNDE-h in exosomes purified from the serum of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The study was divided into four parts: (1) The exosome isolated methods and lncRNA detected methods which accurately and reproducibly measure CRC-related exosomal CRNDE-h in serum were optimized in preliminary pilot stage; (2) The stability of exosomal CRNDE-h was evaluated systematically; (3) The origin of exosomal CRNDE-h was explorated in vitro and in vivo; (4) The diagnostic and prognostic value of exosomal CRNDE-h for CRC were validated in 468 patients. In pilot study, our results indicated that exosomal CRNDE-h was detectable and stable in serum of CRC patients, and derived from tumor cells. Then, the increased expression of exosomal CRNDE-h was successfully validated in 148 CRC patients when compared with colorectal benign disease patients and healthy donors. Exosomal CRNDE-h level significantly correlated with CRC regional lymph node metastasis (P = 0.019) and distant metastasis (P = 0.003). Moreover, at the cut-off value of 0.020 exosomal CRNDE-h level of serum, the area under ROC curve distinguishing CRC from colorectal benign disease patients and healthy donors was 0.892, with 70.3% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity, which was superior to carcinoembryogenic antigen. In addition, high exosomal CRNDE-h level has a lower overall survival rates than that for low groups (34.6% vs. 68.2%, P < 0.001). In conclusion, detection of lncRNA CRNDE-h in exosome shed a light on utilizing exosomal CRNDE-h as a noninvasive serum-based tumor marker for diagnosis and prognosis of CRC.	PMC5356757

Characterization and Functional Analysis of Extracellular Vesicles and Muscle-Abundant miRNAs (miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-206) in C2C12 Myocytes and mdx Mice.	PLoS One	2016	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder. Here, we show that the CD63 antigen, which is located on the surface of extracellular vesicles (EVs), is associated with increased levels of muscle-abundant miRNAs, namely myomiRs miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-206, in the sera of DMD patients and mdx mice. Furthermore, the release of EVs from the murine myoblast C2C12 cell line was found to be modulated by intracellular ceramide levels in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Next, to investigate the effects of EVs on cell survival, C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes were cultured with EVs from the sera of mdx mice or C2C12 cells overexpressing myomiRs in presence of cellular stresses. Both the exposure of C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes to EVs from the serum of mdx mice, and the overexpression of miR-133a in C2C12 cells in presence of cellular stress resulted in a significant decrease in cell death. Finally, to assess whether miRNAs regulate skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo, we intraperitoneally injected GW4869 (an inhibitor of exosome secretion) into mdx mice for 5 and 10 days. Levels of miRNAs and creatine kinase in the serum of GW4869-treated mdx mice were significantly downregulated compared with those of controls. The tibialis anterior muscles of the GW4869-treated mdx mice showed a robust decrease in Evans blue dye uptake. Collectively, these results indicate that EVs and myomiRs might protect the skeletal muscle of mdx mice from degeneration.	PMC5158003

Secretion modification region-derived peptide blocks exosome release and mediates cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cells.	Oncotarget	2017	PURPOSE: Discovery and development of a novel anticancer PEG-SMR-Clu peptide to prevent breast cancer metastasis. How breast cancer cells and primary mammary epithelial cells interact and communicate with each other to promote tumorigenesis and how to prevent tumor metastasis has long been a concern of researchers. Cancer cells secrete exosomes containing proteins and RNA. These factors can influence tumor development by directly targeting cancer cells and tumor stroma. In this study, we determined the effects of a peptide as an inhibitor of exosome secretion on breast tumors. We developed a peptide derived from the Secretion Modification Region (SMR) of HIV-1 Nef protein that was modified with PEG on the N-terminus and with a Clusterin (Clu)-binding peptide on the C-terminus. Attachment of PEG to the SMR peptide, termed PEGylation, offers improved water solubility and stability as well as reduced clearance through the kidneys, leading to a longer circulation time. The 12-mer Clu-binding peptide plays multiple roles in tumor development and metastasis. The Clu peptide can be detected by antibody in vivo, thus it has the potential to be used to monitor tumor status and treatment efficacy in animal studies and eventually in cancer patients. RESULTS: PEG-SMRwt-Clu and PEG-SMRwt peptides inhibited the growth of both of MCF-7 (estrogen responsive, ER+) and MDA-MD-231 (estrogen non-responsive, ER-) human breast cancer cells in a dose and time-dependent manner, without inducing cytotoxic effects. The SMRwt peptide, combined with paclitaxel, induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells but did not promote apoptosis. PEG-SMRwt-Clu peptide treatment blocked exosome release from both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. This effect was blocked by knockdown of the chaperone protein mortalin by either antibody or siRNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells were treated with PEG-SMR-Clu peptide alone and in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin. Cell proliferation and viabilty were determined via cell cycle analysis using Cellometer imaging cytometry, Annexin V and MTT assays. The effects of the PEG-SMR-Clu peptide on tumor exosome release were determined by testing isolated exosome fractions, for (i) expression of CD63 and Alix proteins by Western blotting, (ii) NanoSight nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA 10) to measure exosomes size and concentration, and (iii) measurement of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) for exosome specific enzyme activity. CONCLUSIONS: PEG-SMRwt-CLU peptides inhibited the growth of human breast cancer cells and blocked tumor exosome release in vitro. The peptide alone did not cause increased cytotoxicity or apoptosis induction, but did cause cell cycle G2/M phase arrest in both estrogen responsive and non-responsive breast cancer cells. These data suggest a potential therapeutic value of SMR to prevent breast cancer metastasis and as an adjuvant for the chemotherapeutic treatment of human breast cancer.	PMC5355266

The use of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for gene silencing is considered a cutting-edge technology. Here, AuNPs were functionalized with thiolated oligonucleotides anti-RAB27A (AuNP@PEG@anti-RAB27A) for selective silencing of the gene with a consequent decrease of exosomes´ release by MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells. Furthermore, communication between tumor and normal cells was observed both in terms of alterations in c-Myc gene expression and transportation of the AuNPs, mediating gene silencing in secondary cells.

Cancer Lett	2017	Exosomal-miRNAs are emerging as mediators of crosstalk between tumor cells and macrophages. In this study, we observed that exosomes derived from TWEAK-stimulated macrophages (TMs) could be internalized by epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells and inhibit cell metastasis. Through a miRNA microarray analysis, we identified 19 miRNAs that are differentially expressed in exosomes derived from macrophages treated with or without TWEAK. The study validated that TWEAK not only increased the levels of microRNA-7 (miR-7) in macrophages and its secreted exosomes but also resulted in an elevated level of miR-7 in recipient EOC cells, which eventually reduced the activity of the EGFR/AKT/ERK1/2 pathway. Pre-transfection of antagomiR-7 in TMs substantially decreased the levels of miR-7 in macrophages, its secreted exosomes and the recipient EOC cells with a concomitant enhancement of EOC metastasis, suggesting an involvement of exosomal miR-7 from TMs in modulating the metastasis of EOC cells. Finally, the exosomes from TMs significantly blocked EOC metastasis in a xenograft mouse model. These findings provide a novel model in which TMs inhibit the metastasis of EOC cells via shuttling of exosomal miR-7 to EOC cells, thereby inhibiting the EGFR/AKT/ERK1/2 pathway.

Increased Circulating Exosomal miRNA-223 Is Associated with Acute Ischemic Stroke.	Front Neurol	2017	Recent studies have demonstrated that exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for various diseases including vascular disease. However, specific exosomal miRNAs expression in stroke patients has not been reported yet. Here, we explored whether circulating exosomal miRNAs can serve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke and discussed the potential for clinical application. Blood samples were collected from acute ischemic stroke patients within the first 72 h (n = 50). Circulating exosomes were exacted by Exoquick exosome isolation kit and characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Western blot was performed to assess the expression of exosomal protein makers. Exosomal miRNA-223 (miR-223) was detected by RT-PCR assay. The relationship between the expression levels of miR-223 and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, brain infarct volume, and neurological outcomes were analyzed. Circulating exosomes were isolated and the size of vesicles ranged between 30 and 100 nm. The identification of exosomes was further confirmed by the detection of specific exosomal protein markers CD9, CD63, and Tsg101. Exosomal miR-223 in acute ischemic stroke patients was significantly upregulated compared to control group (p < 0.001). Exosomal miR-223 level was positively correlated with NIHSS scores (r = 0.31, p = 0.03). Exosomal miR-223 expression in stroke patients with poor outcomes was higher than those with good outcomes (p < 0.05). Increased exosomal miR-223 was associated with acute ischemic stroke occurrence, stroke severity, and short-term outcomes. Future studies with large sample are needed to assess the clinical application of exosomal miR-223 as a novel biomarker for ischemic stroke diagnosis.	PMC5326773

Exosome-associated AAV2 vector mediates robust gene delivery into the murine retina upon intravitreal injection.	Sci Rep	2017	Widespread gene transfer to the retina is challenging as it requires vector systems to overcome physical and biochemical barriers to enter and diffuse throughout retinal tissue. We investigated whether exosome-associated adeno-associated virus, (exo-AAV) enabled broad retinal targeting following intravitreal (IVT) injection, as exosomes have been shown to traverse biological barriers and mediate widespread distribution upon systemic injection. We packaged an AAV genome encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) into conventional AAV2 and exo-AAV2 vectors. Vectors were IVT injected into the eyes of adult mice. GFP expression was noninvasively monitored by fundus imaging and retinal expression was analyzed 4 weeks post-injection by qRT-PCR and histology. Exo-AAV2 outperformed conventional AAV2 in GFP expression based on fundus image analysis and qRT-PCR. Exo-AAV2 demonstrated deeper penetration in the retina, efficiently reaching the inner nuclear and outer plexiform, and to a lesser extent the outer nuclear layer. Cell targets were ganglion cells, bipolar cells, Müller cells, and photoreceptors. Exo-AAV2 serves as a robust gene delivery tool for murine retina, and the simplicity of production and isolation should make it widely applicable to basic research of the eye.	PMC5374486

Exosomes Transfer Among Different Species Cells and Mediating miRNAs Delivery.	J Cell Biochem	2017	Exosomes, the natural vehicles of intercellular communication, transfer proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) and mediate many physiological and pathological processes. It is not clear that whether exosomal miRNAs could regulate gene expression across species, though some studies suggest interactions of exosomal miRNAs between cells. In this report, we have isolated exosomes from rat PC12 cells and assessed their internalization by human cancer Hela cells. The internalized exosomes were located in Hela lysosomes. Human PTEN expression was significantly deregulated due to miR-21 delivered by rat cell exosomes. Our results prove that exosomes could incorporate between cells of different species and could regulate the protein expressions in the recipient cells by delivering the enclosed miRNAs. Thus our study foreshadows a futuristic treatment approach of utilizing miRNA enclosed exosome vehicles sans species concerns in combating various diseases/ regulating abnormal proteins. J. Cell.

Electronic address: .	yasuhiko@frontier.kyoto-u.ac.jp		Augmented liver targeting of exosomes by surface modification with cationized pullulan.	Acta Biomater	2017	Exosomes are membrane nanoparticles containing biological substances that are employed as therapeutics in experimental inflammatory models. Surface modification of exosomes for better tissue targetability and enhancement of their therapeutic ability was recently attempted mainly using gene transfection techniques. Here, we show for the first time that the surface modification of exosomes with cationized pullulan, which has the ability to target hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptors, can target injured liver and enhance the therapeutic effect of exosomes. Surface modification can be achieved by a simple mixing of original exosomes and cationized pullulan and through an electrostatic interaction of both substances. The exosomes modified with cationized pullulan were internalized into HepG2 cells in vitro to a significantly greater extent than unmodified ones and this internalization was induced through the asialoglycoprotein receptor that was specifically expressed on HepG2 cells and hepatocytes. When injected intravenously into mice with concanavalin A-induced liver injury, the modified exosomes accumulated in the liver tissue, resulting in an enhanced anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. It is concluded that the surface modification with cationized pullulan promoted accumulation of the exosomes in the liver and the subsequent biological function, resulting in a greater therapeutic effect on liver injury. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Exosomes have shown potentials as therapeutics for various inflammatory disease models. This study is the first to show the specific accumulation of exosomes in the liver and enhanced anti-inflammatory effect via the surface modification of exosomes using pullulan, which is specifically recognized by the asialoglycoprotein receptor (AGPR) on HepG2 cells and hepatocytes. The pullulan was expressed on the surface of PKH-labeled exosomes, and it led increased accumulation of PKH into HepG2 cells, whereas the accumulation was canceled by AGPR inhibitor. In the mouse liver injury model, the modification of PKH-labeled exosomes with pullulan enabled increased accumulation of PKH specifically in the injured liver. Furthermore the greater therapeutic effects against the liver injury compared with unmodified original exosomes was observed.

Characterization of Annexin V Fusion with the Superfolder GFP in Liposomes Binding and Apoptosis Detection.	Front Physiol	2017	Programed cell death is a critical and unavoidable part of life. One of the most widely used markers for dying cells, by apoptosis or pyroptosis, is the redistribution of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner to the outer plasma membrane leaflet. Annexin V protein is a sensitive and specific probe to mark this event because of its high affinity to the exposed PS. Beyond that, annexin V can bind to any PS-containing phospholipid bilayer of almost all tiny forms of membranous vesicles like blood platelets, exosomes, or even nanostructured liposomes. In this work, recombinant human annexin V was produced as a fusion with a highly fluorescent superfolder derivative of the green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein(sfGFP-ANXV, 64 kDa), annexin V (ANXV, 40 kDa), and sfGFP (27 kDa) were separately produced after cloning their encoding genes in pRSET plasmid, and all proteins were expressed in a soluble form, then purified in high yields because of their N-terminal 6× His tag (~150 mg of pure protein per 1 L culture). Superiority of this fluorescent fusion protein over fluorescein-conjugated annexin V was demonstrated in binding to phospholipids (and their liposomes), prepared from natural sources (soya bean and egg yolk) that have different content of PS, by using different methods including ELISA, dot-blotting, surface plasmon resonance, and flow cytometry. We also applied fluorescent annexin V in the detection of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. Interestingly, sfGFP-ANXV fusion was more sensitive to early apoptotic stressed HeLa cells than fluorescein-conjugated-ANXV. This highly expressed and functional sfGFP-ANXV fusion protein provides a promising ready-to-use molecular tool for quantifying liposomes (or similarly exosomes) and detecting apoptosis in cells.

Protective Effect of Intravitreal Administration of Exosomes Derived from Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Retinal Ischemia.	Curr Eye Res	2017	PURPOSE: Exosomes derived from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured under hypoxic conditions contain proteins and growth factors that promote angiogenesis. This study investigated the effect of intravitreal administration of these exosomes on retinal ischemia using a murine model. METHODS: Oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) was induced by exposing one-week-old male C57BL/6J mice to 5 days of 75% hyperoxic conditioning, and returning to room air. After hyperoxic conditioning, the right eye of each mouse was injected intravitreally with 1 µl saline or exosomes derived from hMSCs and compared to control mice of the same age raised in room air without OIR injected intravitreally with saline. Two weeks post-injection, fluorescein angiography (FA) and phase-variance optical coherence tomography angiography (pvOCTA) were used to assess retinal perfusion. Retinal thickness was determined by OCT. The extent of retinal neovascularization was quantitated histologically by counting vascular nuclei on the retinal surface. RESULTS: Among eyes with OIR, intravitreal exosome treatment partially preserved retinal vascular flow in vivo and reduced associated retinal thinning; retinal thickness on OCT was 111.1 ± 7.4µm with saline versus 132.1 ± 11.6µm with exosome, p < 0.001. Retinal neovascularization among OIR eyes was reduced with exosome treatment when compared to saline-treated eyes (7.75 ± 3.68 versus 2.68 ± 1.35 neovascular nuclei per section, p < 0.0001). No immunogenicity or ocular/systemic adverse effect was associated with intravitreal exosome treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal administration of exosomes derived from hMSCs was well tolerated without immunosuppression and decreased the severity of retinal ischemia in this murine model. This appealing novel non-cellular therapeutic approach warrants further exploration.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2017	The BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib can be used to treat patients with metastatic melanomas harboring BRAF V600 mutations. Initial antitumoral responses are often seen, but drug-resistant clones with reactivation of the MEK-ERK pathway soon appear. Recently, the secretome of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been ascribed important functions in cancers. To elucidate the possible functions of EVs in BRAF-mutant melanoma, we determined the RNA content of the EVs, including apoptotic bodies, microvesicles, and exosomes, released from such cancer cells after vemurafenib treatment. We found that vemurafenib significantly increased the total RNA and protein content of the released EVs and caused significant changes in the RNA profiles. RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR show that cells and EVs from vemurafenib-treated cell cultures and tumor tissues harvested from cell-derived and patient-derived xenografts harbor unique miRNAs, especially increased expression of miR-211-5p. Mechanistically, the expression of miR-211-5p as a result of BRAF inhibition was induced by increased expression of MITF that regulates the TRPM1 gene resulting in activation of the survival pathway. In addition, transfection of miR-211 in melanoma cells reduced the sensitivity to vemurafenib treatment, whereas miR-211-5p inhibition in a vemurafenib resistant cell line affected the proliferation negatively. Taken together, our results show that vemurafenib treatment induces miR-211-5p up-regulation in melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo, as well as in subsets of EVs, suggesting that EVs may provide a tool to understand malignant melanoma progression.

Mol Cancer	2017	BACKGROUND: Although gemcitabine-based chemotherapy has been established as a core multimodal therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment, its clinical efficacy remains limited by the development of acquired resistance following tumor metastasis and relapse. In this study, we investigated how gemcitabine-resistant (GR) cells contribute to the development of NSCLC tumor malignancy via exosome-mediated transfer of microRNAs. METHODS: We first studied the mechanism of exosome internalization via PKH-67 staining and an immunofluorescence assay, then confirmed our finding by transmission electron microscopy and western blot analysis. Candidate miRNAs were identified through microarray analysis. Thereafter, RT-PCR, MTS, Transwell and soft agar assays were performed to assess the role of exosomic miR-222-3p in vitro. A 3' untranslated region reporter assay was applied to identify the target of miR-222-3p. A lung metastasis mouse model was constructed to evaluate tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Finally, clinical samples were used for correlation analysis between exosomic miR-222-3p levels and patients' response to gemcitabine. RESULTS: A549-GR-derived exosomes were internalized by receipt cells via caveolin- and lipid raft-dependent endocytosis, which allowed the transfer of miR-222-3p. Exosomic miR-222-3p enhanced the proliferation, gemcitabine resistance, migration, invasion, and anti-anoikis of parental sensitive cells by directly targeting the promoter of SOCS3. In addition, a higher level of exosomic miR-222-3p in sera usually predicted worse prognosis in NSCLC patients. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that exosomic-miR-222-3p functions as a principal regulator of gemcitabine resistance and malignant characteristics by targeting SOCS3. The exosomic miR-222-3p level in sera may be a potential prognostic biomarker for predicting gemcitabine sensitivity in NSCLC patients.	PMC5526308

Increased Release of Apolipoprotein E in Extracellular Vesicles Following Amyloid-β Protofibril Exposure of Neuroglial Co-Cultures.	J Alzheimers Dis	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and larger microvesicles, have been implicated to play a role in several conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since the EV content mirrors the intracellular environment, it could contribute with important information about ongoing pathological processes and may be a useful source for biomarkers, reflecting the disease progression. The aim of the present study was to analyze the protein content of EVs specifically released from a mixed co-culture of primary astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes treated with synthetic amyloid-β (Aβ42) protofibrils. The EV isolation was performed by ultracentrifugation and validated by transmission electron microscopy. Mass spectrometry analysis of the EV content revealed a total of 807 unique proteins, of which five displayed altered levels in Aβ42 protofibril exposed cultures. The most prominent protein was apolipoprotein E (apoE), and by western blot analysis we could confirm a threefold increase of apoE in EVs from Aβ42 protofibril exposed cells, compared to unexposed cells. Moreover, immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that apoE was primarily situated inside the EVs, whereas immunocytochemistry indicated that the EVs most likely derived from the astrocytes and the neurons in the culture. The identified Aβ-induced sorting of apoE into EVs from cultured neuroglial cells suggests a possible role for intercellular transfer of apoE in AD pathology and encourage future studies to fully elucidate the clinical relevance of this event.

FASEB J	2018	Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common cause of morbidity in patients after severe injury due to dysregulated inflammation, which is believed to be driven by gut-derived inflammatory mediators carried via mesenteric lymph (ML). We have previously demonstrated that nano-sized extracellular vesicles, called exosomes, secreted into ML after trauma/hemorrhagic shock (T/HS) have the potential to activate immune cells in vitro Here, we assess the function of ML exosomes in the development of T/HS-induced ALI and the role of TLR4 in the ML exosome-mediated inflammatory response. ML exosomes isolated from rats subjected to T/HS stimulated NF-κB activation and caused proinflammatory cytokine production in alveolar macrophages. In vivo experiments revealed that intravenous injection of exosomes harvested after T/HS, but not before shock, caused recruitment of inflammatory cells in the lung, increased vascular permeability, and induced histologic ALI in naive mice. The exosome-depleted supernatant of ML had no effect on in vitro and in vivo inflammatory responses. We also demonstrated that both pharmacologic inhibition and genetic knockout of TLR4 completely abolished ML exosome-induced cytokine production in macrophages. Thus, our findings define the critical role of exosomes secreted into ML as a critical mediator of T/HS-induced ALI through macrophage TLR4 activation.-Kojima, M., Gimenes-Junior, J. A., Chan, T.

Sci Rep	2017	We have previously shown that rat allogeneic DC, made immature by adenoviral gene transfer of the dominant negative form of IKK2, gave rise in-vitro to a unique population of CD4+CD25- regulatory T cells (dnIKK2-Treg). These cells inhibited Tcell response in-vitro, without needing cell-to-cell contact, and induced kidney allograft survival prolongation in-vivo. Deep insight into the mechanisms behind dnIKK2-Treg-induced suppression of Tcell proliferation remained elusive. Here we document that dnIKK2-Treg release extracellular vesicles (EV) riched in exosomes, fully accounting for the cell-contact independent immunosuppressive activity of parent cells. DnIKK2-Treg-EV contain a unique molecular cargo of specific miRNAs and iNOS, which, once delivered into target cells, blocked cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. DnIKK2-Treg-EV-exposed T cells were in turn converted into regulatory cells. Notably, when administered in-vivo, dnIKK2-Treg-EV prolonged kidney allograft survival. DnIKK2-Treg-derived EV could be a tool for manipulating the immune system and for discovering novel potential immunosuppressive molecules in the context of allotransplantation.	PMC5599553

Sci Rep	2017	Scar formation is an intractable medical problem that appears after skin wounds have healed. Recent research has shown that exosomes secreted by human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASC-Exos) can benefit wound healing. To further explore the therapeutic potential of ASC-Exos, we investigated their effects on mitigating scar formation, and the underlying mechanisms of these effects. We found that intravenous injection of ASC-Exos decreased the size of scars and increased the ratio of collagen III to collagen I in murine incisional wounds. Exosome treatment also prevented the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and increased the ratio of transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3) to TGF-β1 in vivo. Additionally, we found that ASC-Exos increased the matrix metalloproteinases-3 (MMP3) expression of skin dermal fibroblasts by activating the ERK/MAPK pathway, leading to a high ratio of MMP3 to tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP1), which is also beneficial for the remodelling of extracellular matrix (ECM). In conclusion, our results demonstrated that ASC-Exos promote ECM reconstruction in cutaneous wound repair by regulating the ratios of collagen type III: type I, TGF-β3:TGF-β1 and MMP3:TIMP1, and by regulating fibroblast differentiation to mitigate scar formation. Therefore, the application of ASC-Exos may be a novel therapeutic approach for scarless wound repair.	PMC5645460

Circulating exosomal microRNA-203 is associated with metastasis possibly via inducing tumor-associated macrophages in colorectal cancer.	Oncotarget	2017	A primary tumor can create a premetastatic niche in distant organs to facilitate the development of metastasis. The mechanism by which tumor cells communicate with host cells to develop premetastatic niches is unclear. We focused on the role of microRNA (miR) signaling in promoting metastasis. Here, we identified miR-203 as a signaling molecule between tumors and monocytes in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Notably, high expression of serum exosomal miR-203, a major form in circulation, was associated with distant metastasis and an independent poor prognostic factor, whereas low expression in tumor tissues was a poor prognostic factor in CRC patients. We also found that exosomes carrying miR-203 from CRC cells were incorporated into monocytes and miR-203 could promote the expression of M2 markers in vitro, suggesting miR-203 promoted the differentiation of monocytes to M2-tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). In a xenograft mouse model, miR-203-transfected CRC cells developed more liver metastasis compared to control cells. In conclusion, serum exosomal miR-203 expression is a novel biomarker for predicting metastasis, possibly via promoting the differentiation of monocytes to M2-TAMs in CRC. Furthermore, we propose the concept of site-dependent functions for miR-203 in tumor progression.	PMC5667985

Biochim Biophys Acta	2018	Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) characterizes by foetoplacental endothelial dysfunction. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from women with GDM show increased L-arginine transport via the human cationic amino acid transporter 1 (hCAT-1). Moreover, expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and nitric oxide synthesis are increased. Exosomes are increased in maternal plasma from GDM. We evaluated the role of foetoplacental endothelial exosomes on endothelial dysfunction in GDM. Exosomes were isolated from HUVECs from normal (ExN) and GDM (ExGDM) pregnancies. HUVECs were exposed (8h) to ExN or ExGDM and used for wound recovery assay (up to 8h), L-arginine transport, hCAT-1 and eNOS expression and activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and 44 and 42kDa mitogen activated protein kinases (p44/42mapk) and protein kinase B/Akt (Akt) activation. Wound recovery was slower in GDM compared with normal pregnancies and was recovered by ExN. However, ExGDM delayed wound recovery in cells from normal pregnancies. GDM-increased L-arginine transport, hCAT-1 and eNOS expression and activity, and p44/42mapk activation were blocked by ExN, but ExGDM increased these parameters and ROS generation, and reduced eNOS phosphorylation at threonine495 in cells from normal pregnancies. Inhibition of p44/42mapk, but not Akt reversed GDM-increased L-arginine uptake. In conclusion foetoplacental endothelial-released exosomes play a role in the maintenance of a GDM phenotype in HUVECs. It is suggested that ExN and ExGDM cargo are different with differential effects in cells from normal or GDM pregnancies. This phenomenon could contribute to the understanding of mechanisms behind foetoplacental endothelial dysfunction in GDM pregnancies.

Biol Pharm Bull	2017	Cell-derived nanosized vesicles or exosomes are expected to become delivery carriers for functional RNAs, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA). A method to efficiently load functional RNAs into exosomes is required for the development of exosome-based delivery carriers of functional RNAs. However, there is no method to find exosome-tropic exogenous RNA sequences. In this study, we used a systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) method to screen exosome-tropic RNAs that can be used to load functional RNAs into exosomes by conjugation. Pooled single stranded 80-base RNAs, each of which contains a randomized 40-base sequence, were transfected into B16-BL6 murine melanoma cells and exosomes were collected from the cells. RNAs extracted from the exosomes were subjected to next round of SELEX. Cloning and sequencing of RNAs in SELEX-screened RNA pools showed that 29 of 56 clones had a typical RNA sequence. The sequence found by SELEX was enriched in exosomes after transfection to B16-BL6 cells. The results show that the SELEX-based method can be used for screening of exosome-tropic RNAs.

Acta Biomater	2018	The objective of this study was to develop an injectable and biocompatible hydrogel that can deliver a cocktail of therapeutic biomolecules (secretome) secreted by human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) to the peri-infarct myocardium. Gelatin and Laponite® were combined to formulate a shear-thinning, nanocomposite hydrogel (nSi Gel) as an injectable carrier of secretome (nSi Gel+). The growth factor composition and the pro-angiogenic activity of the secretome were tested in vitro by evaluating the proliferation, migration and tube formation of human umbilical endothelial cells. The therapeutic efficacy of the nSi Gel + system was then investigated in vivo in rats by intramyocardial injection into the peri-infarct region. Subsequently, the inflammatory response, angiogenesis, scar formation, and heart function were assessed. Biocompatibility of the developed nSi Gel was confirmed by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical tests which showed no significant differences in the level of inflammatory genes, microRNAs, and cell marker expression compared to the untreated control group. In addition, the only group that showed a significant increase in capillary density, reduction in scar area and improved cardiac function was treated with the nSi Gel+. Our in vitro and in vivo findings demonstrate the potential of this new secretome-loaded hydrogel as an alternative strategy to treat myocardial infarction. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Stem cell based-therapies represent a possible solution to repair damaged myocardial tissue by promoting cardioprotection, angiogenesis, and reduced fibrosis. However, recent evidence indicates that most of the positive outcomes are likely due to the release of paracrine factors (cytokines, growth factors, and exosomes) from the cells and not because of the local engraftment of stem cells. This cocktail of essential growth factors and paracrine signals is known as secretome can be isolated in vitro, and the biomolecule composition can be controlled by varying stem-cell culture conditions. Here, we propose a straightforward strategy to deliver secretome produced from hASCs by using a nanocomposite injectable hydrogel made of gelatin and Laponite®. The designed secretome-loaded hydrogel represents a promising alternative to traditional stem cell therapy for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.	PMC5831493

Cell Metab	2018	Exercise stimulates the release of molecules into the circulation, supporting the concept that inter-tissue signaling proteins are important mediators of adaptations to exercise. Recognizing that many circulating proteins are packaged in extracellular vesicles (EVs), we employed quantitative proteomic techniques to characterize the exercise-induced secretion of EV-contained proteins. Following a 1-hr bout of cycling exercise in healthy humans, we observed an increase in the circulation of over 300 proteins, with a notable enrichment of several classes of proteins that compose exosomes and small vesicles. Pulse-chase and intravital imaging experiments suggested EVs liberated by exercise have a propensity to localize in the liver and can transfer their protein cargo. Moreover, by employing arteriovenous balance studies across the contracting human limb, we identified several novel candidate myokines, released into circulation independently of classical secretion. These data identify a new paradigm by which tissue crosstalk during exercise can exert systemic biological effects.

The exosomes released from different cell types and their effects in wound healing.	J Cell Biochem	2018	Despite important advances in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, still, wound healing remains a challenging clinical problem. Cell therapy has opened a new viewpoint in medicine as well as wound management, although it has some limitations. On the other hand, there are some hopes for the eliminated of cellular therapies limitations by "exosomes." The term "exosome" has been frequently used to describe all vesicles released by different cells into the extracellular environment and can influence tissue responses to injury, infection, immune system, and healing. Exosomes contain cytokines and growth factors, signaling lipids, mRNAs, and regulatory miRNAs that have been found in some body fluids and can be transferred between cells to mediating cell-to-cell communication and interactions. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that exosomes are one of the key secretory products of various cell type especially mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to regulate many biological processes such wound healing. Hence, understanding these exosomes effects may help to improve wound management and highlight a new therapeutic model for cell-free therapies with decreased side effects for the wound repair.

Cholangiocyte-derived exosomal long noncoding RNA H19 promotes cholestatic liver injury in mouse and humans.	Hepatology	2018	Cholestatic liver injury is an important clinical problem with limited understanding of disease pathologies. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released by a variety of cells, including cholangiocytes. Exosome-mediated cell-cell communication can modulate various cellular functions by transferring a variety of intracellular components to target cells. Our recent studies indicate that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), H19, is mainly expressed in cholangiocytes, and its aberrant expression is associated with significant down-regulation of small heterodimer partner (SHP) in hepatocytes and cholestatic liver injury in multidrug resistance 2 knockout (Mdr2-/- ) mice. However, how cholangiocyte-derived H19 suppresses SHP in hepatocytes remains unknown. Here, we report that cholangiocyte-derived exosomes mediate transfer of H19 into hepatocytes and promote cholestatic injury. Hepatic H19 level is correlated with severity of cholestatic injury in both fibrotic mouse models, including Mdr2-/- mice, a well-characterized model of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), or CCl4 -induced cholestatic liver injury mouse models, and human PSC patients. Moreover, serum exosomal-H19 level is gradually up-regulated during disease progression in Mdr2-/- mice and patients with cirrhosis. H19-carrying exosomes from the primary cholangiocytes of wild-type (WT) mice suppress SHP expression in hepatocytes, but not the exosomes from the cholangiocytes of H19-/- mice. Furthermore, overexpression of H19 significantly suppressed SHP expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Importantly, transplant of H19-carrying serum exosomes of old fibrotic Mdr2-/- mice significantly promoted liver fibrosis (LF) in young Mdr2-/- mice. CONCLUSION: Cholangiocyte-derived exosomal-H19 plays a critical role in cholestatic liver injury. Serum exosomal H19 represents a noninvasive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for cholestatic diseases. (Hepatology 2018).

Endothelial extracellular vesicles modulate the macrophage phenotype: Potential implications in atherosclerosis.	Scand J Immunol	2018	Endothelial cells (ECs) and macrophages engage in tight and specific interactions that play critical roles in cardiovascular homeostasis and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are circular membrane fragments released from the endosomal compartment as exosomes or shed from the surfaces of the membranes of most cell types. Increasing evidence indicates that EVs play a pivotal role in cell-to-cell communication. However, the contribution of EVs, as determine by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-exposed and/or Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2)-transduced ECs in the interaction between vascular ECs and monocytes/macrophages, which is a key event in atherosclerotic plaque development, has remained elusive. This study demonstrates the characteristic impact of EVs from ox-LDL-treated and/or KLF2-transduced ECs on the monocyte/macrophage phenotype in vitro and in vivo.Q-PCR showed that both the atherosclerosis inducer ox-LDL and atheroprotective factor KLF2 regulated inflammation-associated microRNA-155 (miR-155) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Moreover, coculture, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry revealed that miR-155 was enriched in ox-LDL-induced ECs-EVs and subsequently transferred to human monocytic THP1 cells, in which these vesicles enhance monocyte activation by shifting the monocytes/macrophages balance from anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages towards proinflammatory M1 macrophages; EVs from KLF2-expressing ECs suppressed monocyte activation by enhancing immunomodulatory responses and diminishing proinflammatory responses, which indicate the potent anti-inflammatory activities of these cells. Furthermore, oil red staining showed that atherosclerotic lesions were reduced in mice that received EVs from KLF2-transduced ECs with decreased proinflammatory M1 macrophages and increased anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, and this effect is at least partly due to the decreased expression of inflammation-associated miR-155, confirming our in vitro findings. In summary, this study provides novel insights into the pathophysiological effects of altered EV secretion and/or microRNA content and their influence on modulating monocyte activation depending on the environment surrounding EVs-releasing ECs.

Cell Death Dis	2018	Exosomes are nano-vesicles secreted by tumor cells. Exosomes can transfer complex biological information and induce a diverse signaling response in a wide array of pathological conditions, such as hypoxia. Hypoxia is associated with aggressive phenotypes and poor outcomes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Here, we analyzed the role of exosomes from hypoxic NPC cells in enhancing the metastases of normoxic cells in a hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α)-dependent manner. HIF-1α rapidly accumulates and trans-activates hundreds of genes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). We found that MMP-13 was over-expressed in exosomes and cells under hypoxic conditions. HIF-1α depletion in hypoxic CNE2 cells led to decreased MMP-13 levels in exosomes and significantly reduced cell migration and invasion. Moreover, exosomal MMP-13 significantly up-regulated Vimentin expression while decreasing E-cadherin levels in CNE2 cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, MMP-13 levels were closely associated with HIF-1α expression (r = 0.679, P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis, clinical stage (all P < 0.05) and poor prognosis in NPC patients (P < 0.01). In conclusion, our findings suggest that the hypoxic exosomes were loaded with MMP-13, which could enhance migration and invasiveness and induce microenvironment changes to promote NPC aggressiveness.

Electronic address: .	bruno.costa-silva@research.fchampalimaud.org		Exosomes as emerging players in cancer biology.	Biochimie	2018	Oncologic diseases do not behave as isolated entities. Instead, they are based on complex systemic networks involving cell-cell communication between cancerous and healthy cells of the host, which may either facilitate or prevent cancer progression. In addition to cell-cell contacts, cells communicate through secreted factors in a process modulated by ligand concentration, receptor availability and synergy amongst several signaling circuits. Of these secreted factors, exosomes, 30-150 nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin released by virtually all cells, have emerged as important cell-cell communication players both in physiological and pathological scenarios by being carriers of all the main biomolecules, including lipids, proteins, DNAs, messenger RNAs and microRNA, and performing intercellular transfer of components, locally and systemically. By acting both in tumor and non-tumor cells, such as fibroblasts, leukocytes, endothelial and progenitor cells, tumor- and non-tumor cells-derived exosomes can modulate tumor growth and invasion, tumor-associated angiogenesis, tissue inflammation and the immune system. In this Review, we summarize the main findings of the literature on the roles of exosomes in mediating interactions between tumor and tumor-associated cells. We also discuss how the molecular composition analysis of circulating exosomes in clinical settings has emerged as an attractive non-invasive source of liquid biopsies for early diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of patients with oncologic diseases.

Dendritic cells loaded with HeLa-derived exosomes simulate an antitumor immune response.	Oncol Lett	2018	The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of loading dendritic cells (DCs) with HeLa-derived exosomes on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses, and the cytotoxic effects of CTL responses on the HeLa cell line. Ultrafiltration centrifugation combined with sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation was applied to isolate exosomes (HeLa-exo) from the supernatant of HeLa cells. Morphological features of HeLa-exo were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)63 was detected by western blotting. Next, monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood and cultured with the removal of adherent cells to induce DC proliferation. DCs were then phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry. Finally, MTT assays were performed to analyze the effects of DCs loaded with HeLa-exo on T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays to evaluate the effect of CTL responses on HeLa cells. TEM revealed that HeLa-exo exhibit typical cup-shaped morphology with a diameter range of 30-100 nm. It was also identified that the CD63 surface antigen is expressed on HeLa-exo. Furthermore, monocyte-derived DCs were able to express CD1a, suggesting that DC induction was a success. DCs exhibited hair-like protrusions and other typical dendritic cell morphology. Furthermore, DCs loaded with HeLa-exo could enhance CTL proliferation and the cytotoxic activity of CTLs compared with DCs without HeLa-exo (P<0.05). In conclusion, DCs loaded with HeLa-exo may promote T cell proliferation and induce CTL responses to inhibit the growth of cervical cancer cells in vitro.	PMC5876420

J Cell Biochem	2018	Asbestos-induced diseases like fibrosis and mesothelioma are very aggressive, without any treatment options. These diseases are diagnosed only at the terminal stages due to lack of early stage biomarkers. The recent discovery of exosomes as circulating biomarkers led us to look for exosomal biomarkers of asbestos exposure in mouse blood. In our model, mice were exposed to asbestos as a single bolus dose by oropharyngeal aspiration. Fifty-six days later blood was collected, exosomes were isolated from plasma and characterized and subjected to proteomic analysis using Tandem Mass Tag labeling. We identified many proteins, some of which were more abundant in asbestos exposed mouse serum exosomes, and three selected proteins were validated by immunoblotting. Our study is the first to show that serum exosomal proteomic signatures can reveal some important proteins relevant to asbestos exposure that have the potential to be validated as candidate biomarkers. We hope to extrapolate the positive findings of this study to humans in future studies.

Gastric Cancer	2018	BACKGROUND: Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) plays important roles in maintaining mucosal homeostasis, and in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we determined whether GKN1 is a potential theragnostic marker for gastric cancer. METHODS: We identified GKN1 binding proteins using the protein microarray assay and investigated whether GKN1 is one of the exosomal cargo proteins by western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescent assays. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed by MTT, BrdU incorporation, flow cytometry, and western blot assays. We further validated the functional relevance of exosomal GKN1 in MKN1-injected xenograft mice. The possibility of serum GKN1 as a diagnostic marker for gastric cancer was determined by ELISA assay. RESULTS: In protein microarray assay, GKN1 binding to 27 exosomal proteins was clearly observed. GKN1 was expressed in exosomes derived from HFE-145 gastric epithelial cells by western blot and immunofluorescent assays, but not in exosomes from AGS and MKN1 gastric cancer cells. Exosomes carrying GKN1 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in both AGS and MKN1 cells, and exosomes carrying GKN1-treated nude mice-bearing MKN1 xenograft tumors exhibited significantly reduced tumor volume and tumor weight. Silencing of clathrin markedly down-regulated the internalization of exosomal GKN1. Interestingly, serum GKN1 concentrations in patients with gastric cancer were significantly lower than those in healthy individuals and patients with colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: The GKN1 is secreted and internalized in the gastric epithelium by exosome-driven transfer, which inhibits gastric tumorigenesis and supports the clinical application of GKN1 protein in gastric cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Adv Exp Med Biol	2018	Stem cell therapies have been proposed as a treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases, but the best stem cell source and therapeutic efficacy for neuroregeneration remain uncertain. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs), which can efficiently generate neural cells, could be good candidates but they pose ethical and practical issues. Not only difficult to find the good source of those cells but also they alway pose immunorejection problem since they may not be an autologous cells. Even if we overcome the immunorejection problem, it has also been reported that transplantation of ESCs develop teratoma. Although adult stem cells are more accessible, they have a limited developmental potential. We developed technologies to increase potency of mesenchymal stem cells, which allow them to develop into neural cells, by over expression of the ESC gene, nanog. We also developed a small molecule compound, which significantly increases endogenous NSCs by peripheral administration, eliminating even the necessity of stem cell injection to the brain. These novel technologies may offer neuroregenerative therapies for Alzheimers disease (AD). However, we found that AD pathological condition prevent neurogenesis from NSCs. This chapter discusses how to overcome the problem associated stem cell therapy under AD pathology and introduces exosome as a tool to improve the modification of adult stem cells. These new technologies may open a door for the new era for AD therapy.

Eur J Immunol	2001	The development of immunological tolerance to orally fed antigens depends on the sampling, processing and transportation events followed in the intestinal epithelium. We present here a description of a "tolerosome": a supra-molecular, exosome-like structure assembled in and released from the small intestinal epithelial cell. The tolerosome is a approximately 40 nm large vesicular structure that carries MHC class II (MHC II) with bound antigenic peptides sampled from the gut lumen. Tolerosomes isolated from serum shortly after antigen feeding or from an in vitro pulsed intestinal epithelial cell line are fully capable of inducing antigen specific tolerance in naive recipient animals. Purified tolerosomes represent a structure by which fed antigens can be efficiently presented to the immune system. Removal of the tolerosomes from serum by ultracentrifugation or absorption of MHC II results in abrogated tolerance development.

Br J Cancer	2005	Dendritic and lymphoid 'exosomes' regulate immune activation. Tumours release membranous material mimicking these 'exosomes,' resulting in deletion of reactive lymphocytes. Tumour-derived 'exosomes' have recently been explored as vaccines, without analysis of their immunologic consequences. This investigation examines the composition of tumour-derived 'exosomes' and their effects on T lymphocytes. Membranous materials were isolated from ascites of ovarian cancer patients (n=6) and Western immunoblotting was performed for markers associated with 'exosomes.' Using cultured T cells, 'exosomes' were evaluated for suppression of CD3-zeta and JAK 3 expressions and induction of apoptosis, measured by DNA fragmentation. 'Exosome' components mediating suppression of CD3-zeta were isolated by continuous eluting electrophoresis and examined by Western immunoblotting. 'Exosomes' were shown to be identical with previously characterised shed membrane vesicles by protein staining and TSG101 expression. 'Exosomes' expressed class I MHC, placental alkaline phosphatase, B23/nucleophosmin, and FasL. 'Exosomes' suppressed expression of T-cell activation signalling components, CD3-zeta and JAK 3 and induced apoptosis. CD3-zeta suppression was mediated by two components: 26 and 42 kDa. Only the 42 kDa component reacted with anti-FasL antibody. These results indicate that, while 'exosomes' express tumour antigens, leading to their proposed utility as tumour vaccines, they also can suppress T-cell signalling molecules and induce apoptosis.

Biol Cell	2006	BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Exosomes are small membrane vesicles secreted by several cell types during exocytic fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. Exosomes from tumour cells can transfer antigens from cell to cell, a property favouring antigen-specific immune responses in vitro and in vivo, and are thus an interesting putative therapeutic tool in human cancers. Exosomes have been well studied in EBV (Epstein-Barr virus)-transformed human B-cell lines; however, biological stimuli regulating exosome secretion quantitatively and/or qualitatively still remain poorly defined. RESULTS: We analysed the effect of the BCR stimulation on exosome release in the human follicular lymphoma B-cell line DOHH2. We found that BCR (B-cell receptor) triggering of DOHH2 cells induced the polarization of CD63(+) MHC class II compartments. Moreover, BCR stimulation increased the release of exosome-associated proteins in the extracellular space. Finally, we found that the BCR was expressed at the surface of exosomes, and could target a bound anti-human IgG to these vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: BCR can modulate the protein content of exosomes upon stimulation, and can target its bound antigen to these vesicles.

Exosome-mediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells.	Nat Cell Biol	2007	Exosomes are vesicles of endocytic origin released by many cells. These vesicles can mediate communication between cells, facilitating processes such as antigen presentation. Here, we show that exosomes from a mouse and a human mast cell line (MC/9 and HMC-1, respectively), as well as primary bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells, contain RNA. Microarray assessments revealed the presence of mRNA from approximately 1300 genes, many of which are not present in the cytoplasm of the donor cell. In vitro translation proved that the exosome mRNAs were functional. Quality control RNA analysis of total RNA derived from exosomes also revealed presence of small RNAs, including microRNAs. The RNA from mast cell exosomes is transferable to other mouse and human mast cells. After transfer of mouse exosomal RNA to human mast cells, new mouse proteins were found in the recipient cells, indicating that transferred exosomal mRNA can be translated after entering another cell. In summary, we show that exosomes contain both mRNA and microRNA, which can be delivered to another cell, and can be functional in this new location. We propose that this RNA is called "exosomal shuttle RNA" (esRNA).

The yeast Ski complex is a hetero-tetramer.	Protein Sci	2008	The yeast Ski complex assists the exosome in the degradation of mRNA. The Ski complex consists of three components; Ski2, Ski3, and Ski8, believed to be present in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. Measuring the mass of intact isolated endogenously expressed Ski complexes by native mass spectrometry we unambiguously demonstrate that the Ski complex has a hetero-tetrameric stoichiometry consisting of one copy of Ski2 and Ski3 and two copies of Ski8. To validate the stoichiometry of the Ski complex, we performed tandem mass spectrometry. In these experiments one Ski8 subunit was ejected concomitant with the formation of a Ski2/Ski3/Ski8 fragment, confirming the proposed stoichiometry. To probe the topology of the Ski complex we disrupted the complex and mass analyzed the thus formed subcomplexes, detecting Ski8-Ski8, Ski2-Ski3, Ski8-Ski2, and Ski8-Ski8-Ski2. Combining all data we construct an improved structural model of the Ski complex.	PMC2144600

Blood	2009	Exosomes are secreted cellular vesicles that can be internalized by dendritic cells (DCs), contributing to antigen-specific naive CD4(+) T-cell activation. Here, we demonstrate that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can exploit this exosome antigen-dissemination pathway intrinsic to mature DCs (mDCs) for mediating trans-infection of T lymphocytes. Capture of HIV-1, HIV-1 Gag-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) viral-like particles (VLPs), and exosomes by DCs was up-regulated upon maturation, resulting in localization within a CD81(+) compartment. Uptake of VLPs or exosomes could be inhibited by a challenge with either particle, suggesting that the expression of common determinant(s) on VLP or exosome surface is necessary for internalization by mDCs. Capture by mDCs was insensitive to proteolysis but blocked when virus, VLPs, or exosomes were produced from cells treated with sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitors that modulate the lipid composition of the budding particles. Finally, VLPs and exosomes captured by mDCs were transmitted to T lymphocytes in an envelope glycoprotein-independent manner, underscoring a new potential viral dissemination pathway.	PMC2661860

Are sodium transporters in urinary exosomes reliable markers of tubular sodium reabsorption in hypertensive patients?	Nephron Physiol	2010	BACKGROUND: Altered renal sodium handling has a major pathogenic role in salt-sensitive hypertension. Renal sodium transporters are present in urinary exosomes. We hypothesized that sodium transporters would be excreted into the urine in different amounts in response to sodium intake in salt-sensitive versus salt-resistant patients. METHODS: Urinary exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation, and their content of Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) and Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) was analyzed by immunoblotting. Animal studies: NKCC2 and NCC excretion was measured in 2 rat models to test whether changes in sodium transporter excretion are indicative of regulated changes in the kidney tissue. Human studies: in hypertensive patients (n = 41), we investigated: (1) a possible correlation between sodium reabsorption and urinary exosomal excretion of sodium transporters, and (2) the profile of sodium transporter excretion related to blood pressure (BP) changes with salt intake. A 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring and a 24-hour urine collection were performed after 1 week on a low- and 1 week on a high-salt diet. RESULTS: Animal studies: urinary NKCC2 and NCC excretion rates correlated well with their abundance in the kidney. Human studies: 6 patients (15%) were classified as salt sensitive. The NKCC2 and NCC abundance did not decrease after the high-salt period, when the urinary sodium reabsorption decreased from 99.7 to 99.0%. In addition, the changes in BP with salt intake were not associated with a specific profile of exosomal excretion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the idea that excretion levels of NKCC2 and NCC via urinary exosomes are markers of tubular sodium reabsorption in hypertensive patients.	PMC2840242

Fragments of antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DC) and DC-derived exosomes induce protective immunity against Leishmania major.	Vaccine	2010	Upon loading with parasite antigen and adoptive transfer, dendritic cells (DC) are able to confer protection against the protozoan parasite Leishmania major. In the present study, we investigated whether viable DC are required for inducing protection. We provide evidence that L. major antigen-loaded DC that had been fixed with paraformaldehyde or exposed to UV irradiation, and even disrupted cells, are able to serve as an effective vaccine. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of DC-derived exosomes to mediate protective immunity against cutaneous leishmaniasis. The route of antigen presentation to recipient T cells involves uptake of intravenously injected DC fragments into late endosomal compartments of splenic DC in the recipient. In vitro studies showed that DC fragments induce T-cell proliferation and interleukin 12 secretion by splenocytes. Together, these findings suggest that the development of a cell-free vaccine for immunoprophylaxis against leishmaniasis and other infectious diseases is feasible.

CARHSP1 is required for effective tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA stabilization and localizes to processing bodies and exosomes.	Mol Cell Biol	2011	Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is a critical mediator of inflammation, and its production is tightly regulated, with control points operating at nearly every step of its biosynthesis. We sought to identify uncharacterized TNF-α 3' untranslated region (3'UTR)-interacting proteins utilizing a novel screen, termed the RNA capture assay. We identified CARHSP1, a cold-shock domain-containing protein. Knockdown of CARHSP1 inhibits TNF-α protein production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells and reduces the level of TNF-α mRNA in both resting and LPS-stimulated cells. mRNA stability assays demonstrate that CARHSP1 knockdown decreases TNF-α mRNA stability from a half-life (t(1/2)) of 49 min to a t(1/2) of 22 min in LPS-stimulated cells and from a t(1/2) of 29 min to a t(1/2) of 24 min in resting cells. Transfecting CARHSP1 into RAW264.7 cells results in an increase in TNF-α 3'UTR luciferase expression in resting cells and CARHSP1 knockdown LPS-stimulated cells. We examined the functional effect of inhibiting Akt, calcineurin, and protein phosphatase 2A and established that inhibition of Akt or calcineurin but not PP2A inhibits CARHSP1 function. Subcellular analysis establishes CARHSP1 as a cytoplasmic protein localizing to processing bodies and exosomes but not on translating mRNAs. We conclude CARHSP1 is a TNF-α mRNA stability enhancer required for effective TNF-α production, demonstrating the importance of both stabilization and destabilization pathways in regulating the TNF-α mRNA half-life.

Cross-dressed dendritic cells drive memory CD8+ T-cell activation after viral infection.	Nature	2011	After an infection, cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors proliferate and become effector cells by recognizing foreign peptides in the groove of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Professional APCs specialized for T-cell activation acquire viral antigen either by becoming infected themselves (direct presentation) or by phagocytosis of infected cells, followed by transfer of antigen to the cytosol, processing and MHC class I loading in a process referred to as cross-presentation. An alternative way, referred to as 'cross-dressing', by which an uninfected APC could present antigen was postulated to be by the transfer of preformed peptide-MHC complexes from the surface of an infected cell to the APC without the need of further processing. Here we show that this mechanism exists and boosts the antiviral response of mouse memory CD8(+) T cells. A number of publications have demonstrated sharing of peptide-loaded MHC molecules in vitro. Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that cross-dressing APCs do not acquire peptide-MHC complexes in the form of exosomes released by donor cells. Rather, the APCs and donor cells have to contact each other for the transfer to occur. After a viral infection, we could isolate cross-dressed APCs able to present viral antigen in vitro. Furthermore, using the diphtheria toxin system to selectively eliminate APCs that could only acquire viral peptide-MHC complexes by cross-dressing, we show that such presentation can promote the expansion of resting memory T cells. Notably, naive T cells were excluded from taking part in the response. Cross-dressing is a mechanism of antigen presentation used by dendritic cells that may have a significant role in activating previously primed CD8(+) T cells.	PMC3423191

Tumor-derived exosomes confer antigen-specific immunosuppression in a murine delayed-type hypersensitivity model.	PLoS One	2011	Exosomes are endosome-derived small membrane vesicles that are secreted by most cell types including tumor cells. Tumor-derived exosomes usually contain tumor antigens and have been used as a source of tumor antigens to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. However, many reports also suggest that tumor-derived exosomes can facilitate tumor immune evasion through different mechanisms, most of which are antigen-independent. In the present study we used a mouse model of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and demonstrated that local administration of tumor-derived exosomes carrying the model antigen chicken ovalbumin (OVA) resulted in the suppression of DTH response in an antigen-specific manner. Analysis of exosome trafficking demonstrated that following local injection, tumor-derived exosomes were internalized by CD11c+ cells and transported to the draining LN. Exosome-mediated DTH suppression is associated with increased mRNA levels of TGF-β1 and IL-4 in the draining LN. The tumor-derived exosomes examined were also found to inhibit DC maturation. Taken together, our results suggest a role for tumor-derived exosomes in inducing tumor antigen-specific immunosuppression, possibly by modulating the function of APCs.	PMC3149056

Int J Biol Sci	2012	Breast milk is a complex liquid rich in immunological components that affect the development of the infant's immune system. Exosomes are membranous vesicles of endocytic origin that are found in various body fluids and that can mediate intercellular communication. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a well-defined group of non-coding small RNAs, are packaged inside exosomes in human breast milk. Here, we identified 602 unique miRNAs originating from 452 miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) in human breast milk exosomes using deep sequencing technology. We found that, out of 87 well-characterized immune-related pre-miRNAs, 59 (67.82%) are presented and enriched in breast milk exosomes (P < 10(-16), χ(2) test). In addition, compared with exogenous synthetic miRNAs, these endogenous immune-related miRNAs are more resistant to relatively harsh conditions. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that these exosomal miRNAs are transferred from the mother's milk to the infant via the digestive tract, and that they play a critical role in the development of the infant immune system.

Exosomes: vehicles for the transfer of toxic proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases?	Front Physiol	2012	Exosomes are small membranous vesicles secreted by a number of cell types including neurons and can be isolated from conditioned cell media or bodily fluids such as urine and plasma. Exosome biogenesis involves the inward budding of endosomes to form multivesicular bodies (MVB). When fused with the plasma membrane, the MVB releases the vesicles into the extracellular environment as exosomes. Proposed functions of these vesicles include roles in cell-cell signaling, removal of unwanted proteins, and the transfer of pathogens between cells. One such pathogen which exploits this pathway is the prion, the infectious particle responsible for the transmissible neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of humans or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) of cattle. Similarly, exosomes are also involved in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Exosomes have been shown to contain full-length APP and several distinct proteolytically cleaved products of APP, including Aβ. In addition, these fragments can be modulated using inhibitors of the proteases involved in APP cleavage. These observations provide further evidence for a novel pathway in which PrP and APP fragments are released from cells. Other proteins such as superoxide dismutase I and alpha-synuclein (involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, respectively) are also found associated with exosomes. This review will focus on the role of exosomes in neurodegenerative disorders and discuss the potential of these vesicles for the spread of neurotoxicity, therapeutics, and diagnostics for these diseases.

Oncogene	2013	Recent findings indicate that specific microRNAs (miRNAs), such as those of the miR-17-92 cluster, may be responsible for regulating endothelial gene expression during tumor angiogenesis. Secreted miRNAs enclosed in exosomes also have an important role in cell-cell communication. To elucidate whether miRNAs secreted from neoplastic cells transfer into endothelial cells and are functionally active in the recipient cells, we investigated the effect of exosomal miRNAs derived from leukemia cells (K562) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). As K562 cells released the miR-17-92 cluster, especially miR-92a, into the extracellular environment, K562 cells, transfected with Cy3-labeled pre-miR-92a, were co-cultured with HUVECs. Cy3-miR-92a derived from K562 cells was detected in the cytoplasm of HUVECs, and the Cy3-miR-92a co-localized with the signals of an exosomal marker, CD63. The expression of integrin α5, a target gene for miR-92a, was significantly reduced in HUVECs by exosomal miR-92a, indicating that exogenous miRNA via exosomal transport can function like endogenous miRNA in HUVECs. The most salient feature of this study is the exosome, derived from K562 cells with enforced miR-92a expression, did not affect the growth of HUVECs but did enhance endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Our results support the idea that exosomal miRNAs have an important role in neoplasia-to-endothelial cell communication.

Cell Host Microbe	2012	Viral nucleic acids often trigger an innate immune response in infected cells. Many viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), have evolved mechanisms to evade intracellular recognition. Nevertheless, HCV-permissive cells can trigger a viral RNA-, TLR7-, and cell-contact-dependent compensatory interferon response in nonpermissive plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Here we report that these events are mediated by transfer of HCV-RNA-containing exosomes from infected cells to pDCs. The exosomal viral RNA transfer is dependent on the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery and on Annexin A2, an RNA-binding protein involved in membrane vesicle trafficking, and is suppressed by exosome release inhibitors. Further, purified concentrated HCV-RNA-containing exosomes are sufficient to activate pDCs. Thus, vesicular sequestration and exosomal export of viral RNA may serve both as a viral strategy to evade pathogen sensing within infected cells and as a host strategy to induce an unopposed innate response in replication-nonpermissive bystander cells.

Biosens Bioelectron	2013	Exosomes biomarkers mediating important biological process, especially in the systemic disease diagnostics and therapeutics, yet the protective exosomal vesicle structure hinders rapid, simple detection of the harbored molecules. We have established a new method, the electric field-induced release and measurement (EFIRM), which can simultaneously disrupt exosomes to release the contents and on-site monitoring the harbored exosomal RNA/proteins biomarkers. When exposed to a non-uniform electrical field, exosomal RNA and proteins are rapidly released. Bio-recognition of these biomolecules is carried out concurrently. We tested the hypothesis that the lung cancer cell line, H460 stably transfected with hCD63-GFP, would shed hCD63-GFP expressing exosomes that could be detected in serum and saliva. We confirmed in vivo that H460-CD63-GFP shed exosomes were transported to blood and saliva. This result demonstrates for the first time tumor-shed exosomes were detected in saliva, in addition to blood, presenting a new translational utility of exosome-based biomarker detection in saliva.

Identification and characterization of proteins isolated from microvesicles derived from human lung cancer pleural effusions.	Proteomics	2013	Microvesicles (MVs, also known as exosomes, ectosomes, microparticles) are released by various cancer cells, including lung, colorectal, and prostate carcinoma cells. MVs released from tumor cells and other sources accumulate in the circulation and in pleural effusion. Although recent studies have shown that MVs play multiple roles in tumor progression, the potential pathological roles of MV in pleural effusion, and their protein composition, are still unknown. In this study, we report the first global proteomic analysis of highly purified MVs derived from human nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) pleural effusion. Using nano-LC-MS/MS following 1D SDS-PAGE separation, we identified a total of 912 MV proteins with high confidence. Three independent experiments on three patients showed that MV proteins from PE were distinct from MV obtained from other malignancies. Bioinformatics analyses of the MS data identified pathologically relevant proteins and potential diagnostic makers for NSCLC, including lung-enriched surface antigens and proteins related to epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. These findings provide new insight into the diverse functions of MVs in cancer progression and will aid in the development of novel diagnostic tools for NSCLC.

Antigen-specific, antibody-coated, exosome-like nanovesicles deliver suppressor T-cell microRNA-150 to effector T cells to inhibit contact sensitivity.	J Allergy Clin Immunol	2013	BACKGROUND: T-cell tolerance of allergic cutaneous contact sensitivity (CS) induced in mice by high doses of reactive hapten is mediated by suppressor cells that release antigen-specific suppressive nanovesicles. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the mechanism or mechanisms of immune suppression mediated by the nanovesicles. METHODS: T-cell tolerance was induced by means of intravenous injection of hapten conjugated to self-antigens of syngeneic erythrocytes and subsequent contact immunization with the same hapten. Lymph node and spleen cells from tolerized or control donors were harvested and cultured to produce a supernatant containing suppressive nanovesicles that were isolated from the tolerized mice for testing in active and adoptive cell-transfer models of CS. RESULTS: Tolerance was shown due to exosome-like nanovesicles in the supernatants of CD8(+) suppressor T cells that were not regulatory T cells. Antigen specificity of the suppressive nanovesicles was conferred by a surface coat of antibody light chains or possibly whole antibody, allowing targeted delivery of selected inhibitory microRNA (miRNA)-150 to CS effector T cells. Nanovesicles also inhibited CS in actively sensitized mice after systemic injection at the peak of the responses. The role of antibody and miRNA-150 was established by tolerizing either panimmunoglobulin-deficient JH(-/-) or miRNA-150(-/-) mice that produced nonsuppressive nanovesicles. These nanovesicles could be made suppressive by adding antigen-specific antibody light chains or miRNA-150, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first example of T-cell regulation through systemic transit of exosome-like nanovesicles delivering a chosen inhibitory miRNA to target effector T cells in an antigen-specific manner by a surface coating of antibody light chains.

C-src enriched serum microvesicles are generated in malignant plasma cell dyscrasia.	PLoS One	2013	Plasma cell dyscrasias are immunosecretory disorders that can lead to hematological malignancies such as Multiple Myeloma (MM). MM accounts for 15% of all hematologic cancers, and those diagnosed with MM typically become severely ill and have a low life expectancy. Monoclonal immunoglobulin Free Light Chains (FLC) are present in the serum and urine of many patients with plasma cell diseases. The biological differences between monoclonal FLCs, produced under malignant or benign dyscrasias, has not yet been characterized. In the present study, we show that endothelial and heart muscle cell lines internalize kappa and lambda FLCs. After internalization, FLCs are rerouted in the extracellular space via microvesicles and exosomes that can be re-internalized in contiguous cells. Only FLCs secreted from malignant B Lymphocytes were carried in Hsp70, annexin V, and c-src positive vesicles. In both MM and AL Amyloidosis patients we observed an increase in microvesicle and exosome production. Isolated serum vesicles from MM, AL Amyloidosis and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) patients contained FLCs. Furthermore MM and AL amyloidosis vesicles were strongly positive for Hsp70, annexin V, and c-src compared to MGUS and control patients. These are the first data implying that FLCs reroute via microvesicles in the blood stream, and also suggest a potential novel mechanism of c-src activation in plasma cell dyscrasia.	PMC3733647

Detection of extracellular RNAs in cancer and viral infection via tethered cationic lipoplex nanoparticles containing molecular beacons.	Anal Chem	2013	Noninvasive early detection methods have the potential to reduce mortality rates of both cancer and infectious diseases. Here, we present a novel assay by which tethered cationic lipoplex nanoparticles containing molecular beacons (MBs) can capture cancer cell-derived exosomes or viruses and identify encapsulated RNAs in a single step. A series of ultracentrifugation and Exoquick isolation kit were first used to isolate exosomes from the cell culture medium and human serum, respectively. Cationic lipoplex nanoparticles linked onto the surface of a thin glass plate capture negatively charged viruses or cell-secreted exosomes by electrostatic interactions to form larger nanoscale complexes. Lipoplex/virus or lipoplex/exosome fusion leads to the mixing of viral/exosomal RNAs and MBs within the lipoplexes. After the target RNAs specially bind to the MBs, exosomes enriched in target RNAs are readily identified by the fluorescence signals of MBs. The in situ detection of target extracellular RNAs without diluting the samples leads to high detection sensitivity not achievable by existing methods, e.g., quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Here we demonstrate this concept using lentivirus and serum from lung cancer patients.	PMC4121114

Autophagy as a mechanism of antiviral defense at the maternal-fetal interface.	Autophagy	2013	Mechanisms to protect against viral infections are crucial during pregnancy as maternal-fetal transmission can have serious pathological outcomes, including fetal infection and its sequelae, such as growth restriction, birth defects, and/or fetal death. The trophoblast forms the interface between the feto-placental unit and the maternal blood, and is therefore a critical physical and immunological barrier to restrict the spread of pathogens into the fetal microenvironment. Recently, we found that primary human placental trophoblast (PHT) cells are highly resistant to infection by diverse viruses. In this study, we also found that conditioned medium from PHT cell cultures transferred viral resistance to nonplacental recipient cells, suggesting that a component secreted by trophoblasts and present within the conditioned medium is responsible for this antiviral effect. We found that specific miRNAs from a unique primate- and placental-specific locus?the C19MC (chromosome 19 miRNA cluster)?are packaged within exosomes produced by PHT cells and confer viral resistance in nonplacental recipient cells. In addition to conveying viral resistance, we found that PHT-derived exosomes and select miRNA members of the C19MC family strongly induce autophagy, which is involved in recipient cell viral resistance. Our findings establish an exciting and novel mechanism by which placental trophoblasts exploit exosome-dependent transfer of placental-specific miRNAs to influence autophagic induction and antiviral immunity at the maternal?fetal interface.

Staphylococcal entorotoxin B anchored exosome induces apoptosis in negative esterogen receptor breast cancer cells.	Tumour Biol	2014	Exosomes (EXO) are acellular vehicles used for cancer immunotherapy due to their immune inducing properties. To identify whether designed structure based on tumoral EXO have a cytotoxic effect together with a potent immunological property, we synthesized a novel structure based on EXO and staphylococcal entrotoxin B (SEB), two immune inducer substances, and surveyed its cytostatic effect on the breast cancer cell line. EXO were purified from tumor cells and SEB was anchored on it by protein transfer method. To determine the cytotoxic and apoptosis inducing effect of this structure, treated cells with different concentrations of EXO/SEB were examined by MTT assay and Hoechst staining method. In addition, the expression rate of bcl-2, bax, bak, fas, bcl-xl and the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were assessed. We observed that EXO/SEB significantly decreased the cell proliferation and stimulated apoptosis (P < 0.001) at all concentration after 24 h (P < 0.001). Furthermore, EXO/SEB raised the expression rate of bax and bak (P < 0.001) but no impact on fas and bcl-xl after 48 h. We observed reducing effect of EXO/SEB on the mRNA expression of bcl-2. After 24 h of exposing the cell with the EXO/SEB, a significant increase was found in the activity of caspase at the concentration of 2.5, 5 and 10 μg/100 μl for caspase-9 and at all concentrations for caspase-3 (P < 0.001). Our designed structure, the EXO/SEB, is a novel model for apopto-immunotherapy being able to induce apoptosis in ER(-) breast cancer cells.

Exosomes are involved in mediating radiation induced bystander signaling in human keratinocyte cells.	Radiat Res	2014	There is much evidence supporting the existence of bystander effects in cells that were never exposed to radiation. Directly irradiated cells and bystander cells can communicate with each other using gap junctional intercellular communication or by releasing soluble factors into the surrounding medium. Exosomes and microvesicles are also known to mediate communication between cells. The main aim of this study is to establish whether exosomes and microvesicles are involved in radiation induced bystander signaling. Human keratinocytes, HaCaT cells, were irradiated (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy) using γ rays produced from a cobalt 60 teletherapy unit. After irradiation, the cells were incubated for 1 h and the irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) was harvested. Exosomes were isolated from the ICCM using ultracentrifugation. Exosomes were characterized using light scattering analysis (LSA) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species assays and real time calcium imaging were performed either with ICCM from which exosomes and microvesicles were removed or with the exosome fraction resuspended in cell culture media. The characterization data showed a particle size distribution indicative of both exosomes (30-100 nm) and microvesicles (>100 nm) and the light scattering analysis showed increased concentration of both exosomes and microvesicles with increasing dose. Western blotting confirmed the presence of an exosomal protein marker, TSG 101. Treatment of unirradiated cells with ICCM in which exosomes and microvesicles were removed resulted in abrogation of ICCM induced effects such as reduction in viability, calcium influx and production of reactive oxygen species. Addition of exosomes to fresh media produced similar effects to complete ICCM. These results suggest a role for exosomes and microvesicles in radiation induced bystander signaling.

Electronic address: .	alan.schroit@utsouthwestern.edu		A novel "salting-out" procedure for the isolation of tumor-derived exosomes.	J Immunol Methods	2014	The last decade has seen an exponential growth in the number of exosome-related publications. Although many of these studies have used exosomes from biological fluids (blood, and ascites or pleural effusions) the vast majority employed vesicles isolated from large volumes of tissue culture supernatants. While several techniques are available for their isolation, all require a significant reduction in volume to obtain sufficient concentrations for study. One approach is to concentrate the medium before proceeding with their isolation, however, these procedures are very time consuming and require specialized laboratory equipment. Here we provide a new and effective method for the isolation of tumor-derived exosomes based on "charge neutralization" with acetate. We show that titration of tissue culture supernatants with 0.1M acetate to pH4.75 results in immediate precipitation of virtually all the exosomes. The precipitated exosomes can be washed to remove residual media and are readily "resolubilized" upon resuspension in acetate-free buffer at neutral pH. This simple cost effective method significantly increases the yield of exosomes from an unlimited quantity of culture supernatants. Exosomes isolated by this technique are indistinguishable from exosomes recovered by direct ultracentrifugation.	PMC4077054

J Theor Biol	2014	Transgenerational inheritance of environment induced phenotype requires transmission of epigenetic information through the germline. Whereas several epigenetic factors have been implicated in germline transmission, mediators of information transfer from soma to the germline remain unidentified in mammals. Notably, a recent bioinformatic analysis showed association of extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) and altered transcriptomes in diverse instances of mammalian epigenetic inheritance involving different environmental factors, tissues, life cycle stages, generations and genders. It was predicted that regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) may potentially mediate soma to germline information transfer. Remarkably, the present bioinformatic evidence suggests similar association of exosomal mRNAs and proteins. The differentially expressed genes reported previously in genome level expression profiling studies related to or relevant in epigenetic inheritance showed enrichment for documented set of exosomal mRNAs in a few instances of epigenetic inheritance and of exosomal proteins in a majority of instances. Differentially expressed genes encoding exosomal miRNAs and proteins, directly or indirectly through first and/or second degree interactome networks, overrepresented biological processes related to environmental factors used in these instances as well as to epigenetic alterations, especially chromatin and histone modifications. These findings predict that exosomal mRNAs and proteins, like extracellular miRNAs, may also potentially mediate soma to germline information transfer. A convergent conceptual model is presented wherein extracellular ncRNAs/miRNA, mRNAs and proteins provide the much needed continuum inclusive of epigenetic inheritance. The phrase "transgenerational systems biology" is introduced to signify that the realm of systems biology extends beyond an individual organism and encompasses generations.

In this report, utilizing selective inhibitors, molecular tools, and specific endocytosis markers, the cellular uptake of PC12 cell-derived exosomes was imaged by high-throughput microscopy and statistically analyzed. It was found that the uptake was through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. Furthermore, PC12 cell-derived exosomes can enter and deliver microRNAs (miRNAs) into bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), and decrease the expression level of transforming growth factor β receptor II (TGFβRII) and tropomyosin-1 (TPM1) through miR-21.

Nanoscale	2014	Exosomes are enclosed compartments that are released from cells and that can transport biological contents for the purpose of intercellular communications. Research into exosomes is hindered by their rarity. In this article, we introduce a device that uses centrifugal force and a filter with micro-sized pores to generate a large quantity of cell-derived nanovesicles. The device has a simple polycarbonate structure to hold the filter, and operates in a common centrifuge. Nanovesicles are similar in size and membrane structure to exosomes. Nanovesicles contain intracellular RNAs ranging from microRNA to mRNA, intracellular proteins, and plasma membrane proteins. The quantity of nanovesicles produced using the device is 250 times the quantity of naturally secreted exosomes. Also, the quantity of intracellular contents in nanovesicles is twice that in exosomes. Nanovesicles generated from murine embryonic stem cells can transfer RNAs to target cells. Therefore, this novel device and the nanovesicles that it generates are expected to be used in exosome-related research, and can be applied in various applications such as drug delivery and cell-based therapy.	
25311367	Jan Lötvall				Mast cell exosomes promote lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation - role of KIT-stem cell factor signaling.	Cell Commun Signal	2014	BACKGROUND: Human cells release nano-sized vesicles called exosomes, containing mRNA, miRNA and specific proteins. Exosomes from one cell can be taken up by another cell, which is a recently discovered cell-to-cell communication mechanism. Also, exosomes can be taken up by different types of cancer cells, but the potential functional effects of mast cell exosomes on tumor cells remain unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Exosomes were isolated from the human mast cell line, HMC-1, and uptake of PKH67-labelled exosomes by the lung epithelial cell line, A549, was examined using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. The RNA cargo of the exosomes was analyzed with a Bioanalyzer and absence or presence of the c-KIT mRNA was determined by RT-PCR. The cell proliferation was determined in a BrdU incorporation assay, and proteins in the KIT-SCF signaling pathway were detected by Western blot. Our result demonstrates that exosomes from mast cells can be taken up by lung cancer cells. Furthermore, HMC-1 exosomes contain and transfer KIT protein, but not the c-KIT mRNA to A549 cells and subsequently activate KIT-SCF signal transduction, which increase cyclin D1 expression and accelerate the proliferation in the human lung adenocarcinoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that exosomes can transfer KIT as a protein to tumor cells, which can affect recipient cell signaling events through receptor-ligand interactions.	PMC4206705

Altered microRNA expression profile in exosomes during osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.	PLoS One	2014	The physiological role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in osteoblast differentiation remains elusive. Exosomal miRNAs isolated from human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) culture were profiled using miRNA arrays containing probes for 894 human matured miRNAs. Seventy-nine miRNAs (∼8.84%) could be detected in exosomes isolated from BMSC culture supernatants when normalized to endogenous control genes RNU44. Among them, nine exosomal miRNAs were up regulated and 4 miRNAs were under regulated significantly (Relative fold>2, p<0.05) when compared with the values at 0 day with maximum changes at 1 to 7 days. Five miRNAs (miR-199b, miR-218, miR-148a, miR-135b, and miR-221) were further validated and differentially expressed in the individual exosomal samples from hBMSCs cultured at different time points. Bioinformatic analysis by DIANA-mirPath demonstrated that RNA degradation, mRNA surveillance pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, RNA transport were the most prominent pathways enriched in quantiles with differential exosomal miRNA patterns related to osteogenic differentiation. These data demonstrated exosomal miRNA is a regulator of osteoblast differentiation.	PMC4263734

Exosome delivered anticancer drugs across the blood-brain barrier for brain cancer therapy in Danio rerio.	Pharm Res	2015	PURPOSE: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) essentially restricts therapeutic drugs from entering into the brain. This study tests the hypothesis that brain endothelial cell derived exosomes can deliver anticancer drug across the BBB for the treatment of brain cancer in a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four types of exosomes were isolated from brain cell culture media and characterized by particle size, morphology, total protein, and transmembrane protein markers. Transport mechanism, cell uptake, and cytotoxicity of optimized exosome delivery system were tested. Brain distribution of exosome delivered anticancer drugs was evaluated using transgenic zebrafish TG (fli1: GFP) embryos and efficacies of optimized formations were examined in a xenotransplanted zebrafish model of brain cancer model. RESULTS: Four exosomes in 30-100 diameters showed different morphologies and exosomes derived from brain endothelial cells expressed more CD63 tetraspanins transmembrane proteins. Optimized exosomes increased the uptake of fluorescent marker via receptor mediated endocytosis and cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs in cancer cells. Images of the zebrafish showed exosome delivered anticancer drugs crossed the BBB and entered into the brain. In the brain cancer model, exosome delivered anticancer drugs significantly decreased fluorescent intensity of xenotransplanted cancer cells and tumor growth marker. CONCLUSIONS: Brain endothelial cell derived exosomes could be potentially used as a carrier for brain delivery of anticancer drug for the treatment of brain cancer.	PMC4520542

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	BACKGROUND: Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is the most widely used serum supplement for mammalian cell culture. It supports cell growth by providing nutrients, growth signals, and protection from stress. Attempts to develop serum-free media that support cell expansion to the same extent as serum-supplemented media have not yet succeeded, suggesting that FBS contains one or more as-yet-undefined growth factors. One potential vehicle for the delivery of growth factors from serum to cultured cells is extracellular vesicles (EVs). METHODS: EV-depleted FBS and human serum were generated by 120,000g centrifugation, and its cell growth-supporting activity was measured. Isolated EVs from FBS were quantified and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, electron microscopy, and protein assay. EV internalization into cells was quantified using fluorescent plate reader analysis and microscopy. RESULTS: Most cell types cultured with EV-depleted FBS showed a reduced growth rate but not an increased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent etoposide and the endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing chemical tunicamycin. Supplying cells with isolated FBS-derived EVs enhanced their growth. FBS-derived EVs were internalized by mouse and human cells wherein 65±26% of them interacted with the lysosomes. EV-depleted human serum also exhibited reduced cell growth-promoting activity. CONCLUSIONS: EVs play a role in the cell growth and survival-promoting effects of FBS and human serum. Thus, it is important to take the effect of EV depletion under consideration when planning EV extraction experiments and while attempting to develop serum-free media that support rapid cell expansion. In addition, these findings suggest roles for circulating EVs in supporting cell growth and survival in vivo.	PMC4376846

As they are accessible in most biofluids (e.g., blood, urine, or saliva), these biological entities are promising tools for cancer diagnostics, offering a non-invasive and remote access to the molecular state of the disease. The composition of exosomes derived from cancer cells depends on the sort and state of the tumor, requiring a screening of multiple antigens to fully characterize the disease. Here, we exploited the capacity of surface plasmon resonance biosensing to detect simultaneously multiple exosomal and cancer biomarkers on exosomes derived from breast cancer cells. We developed an immunosensor surface which provides efficient and specific capture of exosomes, together with their identification through their distinct molecular profiles. The successful analysis of blood samples demonstrated the suitability of our bioanalytical procedure for clinical use.	PMC4477949

Oral administration of bovine milk derived extracellular vesicles attenuates arthritis in two mouse models.	Mol Nutr Food Res	2015	SCOPE: This study shows the effect of bovine milk derived extracellular vesicles (BMEVs) on spontaneous polyarthritis in IL-1Ra-deficient mice and collagen-induced arthritis. METHODS AND RESULTS: BMEVs were isolated from semi-skimmed milk by ultracentrifugation and the particle size was around 100 nm by dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. BMEVs expressed exosome marker CD63, immunoregulatory microRNA's (miR-30a, -223, -92a), and milk-specific beta-casein and beta-lactoglobulin mRNA. In vitro, PKH-67-labeled BMEVs were taken up by RAW264.7, splenocytes, and intestinal cells as determined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. IL-1Ra(-/-) mice received BMEVs by daily oral gavage starting at wk 5 till 15 after birth and collagen-induced arthritis mice via their drinking water starting 1 wk before immunization till day 40. Macroscopically, BMEV treatment delayed the onset of arthritis and histology showed diminished cartilage pathology and bone marrow inflammation in both models. BMEV treatment also reduced the serum levels of MCP-1 and IL-6 and their production by splenic cells. BMEV treatment diminished the anticollagen IgG2a levels, which was accompanied by reduced splenic Th1 (Tbet) and Th17 (RORγT) mRNA. CONCLUSION: This is the first report that oral delivery of BMEVs ameliorates experimental arthritis and this warrants further research to determine whether this beneficial effect can be seen in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

Exosomes isolated from plasma of glioma patients enrolled in a vaccination trial reflect antitumor immune activity and might predict survival.	Oncoimmunology	2015	Exosomes in plasma of glioma patients hold promise as biomarkers of prognosis. We aimed to determine whether changes in total exosomal protein and mRNA expression levels could serve as surrogate markers of immunological and clinical responses in glioma patients receiving antitumor vaccines. Exosomes were isolated from pre/post-vaccine plasma specimens in 20/22 patients enrolled in a phase I/II trial with the antitumor vaccine. Exosomal protein content was analyzed and mRNA expression levels for 24 genes were simultaneously assessed by qRT-PCR. Pre- to post-vaccination changes in exosomal protein and ΔCt values were correlated with immunological and clinical responses and survival using Spearman rank statistics and hazard ratios (HR). Exosomal protein levels positively correlated (p < 0.0043) with the WHO tumor grade at diagnosis. Protein levels were lower in post- vs. pre-vaccination exosome fractions. Post-therapy increases in tumor size were associated with elevations in exosome proteins in glioblastoma but not always in anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). Only exosomal ΔCt values for IL-8, TIMP-1, TGF-β and ZAP70 were significant (p < 0.04 to p < 0.001). The ΔCt for IL-8 and TGF-β mRNA positively correlated with post-vaccine immunologic responses to glioma antigens, while ΔCt for TIMP-1 mRNA was negatively correlated to ΔCt for IL-8 and TGF-β. Only ΔCt for IL-8 weakly correlated with OS and time to progression (TTP). In post-vaccine exosomes of the longest surviving patient with AA, mRNA for PD-1 was persistently elevated. Protein and mRNA expression levels for immune-related genes in plasma exosomes were useful in evaluating glioma patients' response to vaccination therapy.	PMC4485717

Electronic address: .	alex.lentsch@uc.edu		Hepatocyte exosomes mediate liver repair and regeneration via sphingosine-1-phosphate.	J Hepatol	2016	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Exosomes are small membrane vesicles involved in intercellular communication. Hepatocytes are known to release exosomes, but little is known about their biological function. We sought to determine if exosomes derived from hepatocytes contribute to liver repair and regeneration after injury. METHODS: Exosomes derived from primary murine hepatocytes were isolated and characterized biochemically and biophysically. Using cultures of primary hepatocytes, we tested whether hepatocyte exosomes induced proliferation of hepatocytes in vitro. Using models of ischemia/reperfusion injury and partial hepatectomy, we evaluated whether hepatocyte exosomes promote hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration in vivo. RESULTS: Hepatocyte exosomes, but not exosomes from other liver cell types, induce dose-dependent hepatocyte proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, hepatocyte exosomes directly fuse with target hepatocytes and transfer neutral ceramidase and sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) causing increased synthesis of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) within target hepatocytes. Ablation of exosomal SK prevents the proliferative effect of exosomes. After ischemia/reperfusion injury, the number of circulating exosomes with proliferative effects increases. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that hepatocyte-derived exosomes deliver the synthetic machinery to form S1P in target hepatocytes resulting in cell proliferation and liver regeneration after ischemia/reperfusion injury or partial hepatectomy. These findings represent a potentially novel new contributing mechanism of liver regeneration and have important implications for new therapeutic approaches to acute and chronic liver disease.

Release of Small RNA-containing Exosome-like Vesicles from the Human Filarial Parasite Brugia malayi.	PLoS Negl Trop Dis	2015	Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a socio-economically devastating mosquito-borne Neglected Tropical Disease caused by parasitic filarial nematodes. The interaction between the parasite and host, both mosquito and human, during infection, development and persistence is dynamic and delicately balanced. Manipulation of this interface to the detriment of the parasite is a promising potential avenue to develop disease therapies but is prevented by our very limited understanding of the host-parasite relationship. Exosomes are bioactive small vesicles (30-120 nm) secreted by a wide range of cell types and involved in a wide range of physiological processes. Here, we report the identification and partial characterization of exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) released from the infective L3 stage of the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi. Exosome-like vesicles were isolated from parasites in culture media and electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis were used to confirm that vesicles produced by juvenile B. malayi are exosome-like based on size and morphology. We show that loss of parasite viability correlates with a time-dependent decay in vesicle size specificity and rate of release. The protein cargo of these vesicles is shown to include common exosomal protein markers and putative effector proteins. These Brugia-derived vesicles contain small RNA species that include microRNAs with host homology, suggesting a potential role in host manipulation. Confocal microscopy shows J774A.1, a murine macrophage cell line, internalize purified ELVs, and we demonstrate that these ELVs effectively stimulate a classically activated macrophage phenotype in J774A.1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of exosome-like vesicle release by a human parasitic nematode and our data suggest a novel mechanism by which human parasitic nematodes may actively direct the host responses to infection. Further interrogation of the makeup and function of these bioactive vesicles could seed new therapeutic strategies and unearth stage-specific diagnostic biomarkers.	PMC4581865

Cancer Lett	2016	Although microRNA (miRNA) enclosed in exosomes can mediate intercellular communication, the roles of exosomal miRNA and angiogenesis in lung cancer remain unclear. We investigated functions of STAT3-regulated exosomal miR-21 derived from cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-transformed human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells in the angiogenesis of CSE-induced carcinogenesis. miR-21 levels in serum were higher in smokers than those in non-smokers. The medium from transformed HBE cells promoted miR-21 levels in normal HBE cells and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Transformed cells transferred miR-21 into normal HBE cells via exosomes. Knockdown of STAT3 reduced miR-21 levels in exosomes derived from transformed HBE cells, which blocked the angiogenesis. Exosomes derived from transformed HBE cells elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in HBE cells and thereby promoted angiogenesis in HUVEC cells. Inhibition of exosomal miR-21, however, decreased VEGF levels in recipient cells, which blocked exosome-induced angiogenesis. Thus, miR-21 in exosomes leads to STAT3 activation, which increases VEGF levels in recipient cells, a process involved in angiogenesis and malignant transformation of HBE cells. These results, demonstrating the function of exosomal miR-21 from transformed HBE cells, provide a new perspective for intervention strategies to prevent carcinogenesis of lung cancer.

Targeted exosome-mediated delivery of opioid receptor Mu siRNA for the treatment of morphine relapse.	Sci Rep	2015	Cell-derived exosomes have been demonstrated to be efficient carriers of small RNAs to neighbouring or distant cells, highlighting the preponderance of exosomes as carriers for gene therapy over other artificial delivery tools. In the present study, we employed modified exosomes expressing the neuron-specific rabies viral glycoprotein (RVG) peptide on the membrane surface to deliver opioid receptor mu (MOR) siRNA into the brain to treat morphine addiction. We found that MOR siRNA could be efficiently packaged into RVG exosomes and was associated with argonaute 2 (AGO2) in exosomes. These exosomes efficiently and specifically delivered MOR siRNA into Neuro2A cells and the mouse brain. Functionally, siRNA-loaded RVG exosomes significantly reduced MOR mRNA and protein levels. Surprisingly, MOR siRNA delivered by the RVG exosomes strongly inhibited morphine relapse via the down-regulation of MOR expression levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that targeted RVG exosomes can efficiently transfer siRNA to the central nervous system and mediate the treatment of morphine relapse by down-regulating MOR expression levels. Our study provides a brand new strategy to treat drug relapse and diseases of the central nervous system.	PMC4668387

Serum-derived exosomes from mice with highly metastatic breast cancer transfer increased metastatic capacity to a poorly metastatic tumor.	Cancer Med	2016	Altered interaction between CD200 and CD200R represents an example of "checkpoint blockade" disrupting an effective, tumor-directed, host response in murine breast cancer cells. In CD200R1KO mice, long-term cure of EMT6 breast cancer, including metastatic spread to lung and liver, was achieved in BALB/c mice. The reverse was observed with 4THM tumors, an aggressive, inflammatory breast cancer, with increased tumor metastasis in CD200R1KO. We explored possible explanations for this difference. We measured the frequency of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood of tumor bearers, as well as lung/liver and draining lymph nodes. In some cases mice received infusions of exosomes from nontumor controls, or tumor bearers, with/without additional infusions of anticytokine antibodies. The measured frequency of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood was equivalent in the two models in WT and CD200R1KO mice. Increased metastasis in EMT6 tumor bearers was seen in vivo following adoptive transfer of serum, or serum-derived exosomes, from 4THM tumor bearers, an effect which was attenuated by anti-IL-6, and anti-IL-17, but not anti-TNFα, antibody. Anti-IL-6 also attenuated enhanced migration of EMT6 cells in vitro induced by 4THM serum or exosomes, or recombinant IL-6. Exosome cytokine proteomic profiles responses in 4THM and EMT6 tumor-bearing mice were regulated by CD200:CD200R interactions, with attenuation of both IL-6 and IL-17 in 4THM CD200(tg) mice, and enhanced levels in 4THM CD200R1KO mice. We suggest these cytokines act on the microenvironment at sites within the host, and/or directly on tumor cells themselves, to increase metastatic potential.	PMC4735763

Microvesicles from Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Are Involved in HPC-Microenvironment Crosstalk in Myelodysplastic Patients.	PLoS One	2016	Exosomes/microvesicles (MVs) provide a mechanism of intercellular communication. Our hypothesis was that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients could modify CD34+ cells properties by MVs. They were isolated from MSC from MDS patients and healthy donors (HD). MVs from 30 low-risk MDS patients and 27 HD were purified by ExoQuick-TC™ or ultracentrifugation and identified by transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry (FC) and western blot for CD63. Incorporation of MVs into CD34+ cells was analyzed by FC, and confocal and fluorescence microscopy. Changes in hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) properties were assessed from modifications in microRNAs and gene expression in CD34+ cells as well as viability and clonogenic assays of CD34+ cells after MVs incorporation. Some microRNAs were overexpressed in MVs from patients MSC and two of them, miR-10a and miR-15a, were confirmed by RT-PCR. These microRNAs were transferred to CD34+ cells, modifying the expression of MDM2 and P53 genes, which was evaluated by RT-PCR and western blot. Finally, examining CD34+ cells properties after incorporation, higher cell viability (p = 0.025) and clonogenic capacity (p = 0.037) were observed when MVs from MDS patients were incorporated. In summary, we show that BM-MSC release MVs with a different cargo in MDS patients compared with HD. These structures are incorporated into HPC and modify their properties.	PMC4737489

J Dent Res	2016	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which include exosomes and ectosomes/microvesicles, have emerged as important intercellular regulators. EVs can interact with surface receptors of target cells and can transport luminal components, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs, and enzymes, to the cytosol of the target cell. Here, we show that hematopoietic cells grown in culture shed exosome-like EVs as they differentiate from preosteoclasts into osteoclasts. These EVs were between 25 and 120 nm (mean, 40 nm) in diameter determined by transmission electron microscopy. The exosome-associated markers CD63 and EpCAM were enriched in the isolated EVs while markers of Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum were not detected. Treatment of isolated hematopoietic cells with EVs did not affect their receptor activator of nuclear factor κB-ligand (RANKL)-stimulated differentiation into osteoclasts. However, EVs from osteoclast precursors promoted 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-dependent osteoclast formation in whole mouse marrow cultures, and EVs from osteoclast-enriched cultures inhibited osteoclastogenesis in the same cultures. These data suggested that osteoclast-derived EVs are paracrine regulators of osteoclastogenesis. EVs from mature osteoclasts contained receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK). Immunogold labeling showed RANK was enriched in 1 in every 32 EVs isolated from osteoclast-enriched cultures. Depletion of RANK-rich EVs relieved the ability of osteoclast-derived EVs to inhibit osteoclast formation in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-stimulated marrow cultures. In summary, we show for the first time that EVs released by osteoclasts are novel regulators of osteoclastogenesis. Our data suggest that RANK in EVs may be mechanistically linked to the inhibition of osteoclast formation. RANK present in EVs may function by competitively inhibiting the stimulation of RANK on osteoclast surfaces by RANKL similar to osteoprotegerin. RANK-rich EVs may also take advantage of the RANK/RANKL interaction to target RANK-rich EVs to RANKL-bearing cells for the delivery of other regulatory molecules.	PMC4924543

Residual matrix from different separation techniques impacts exosome biological activity.	Sci Rep	2016	Exosomes are gaining a prominent role in research due to their intriguing biology and several therapeutic opportunities. However, their accurate purification from body fluids and detailed physicochemical characterization remain open issues. We isolated exosomes from serum of patients with Multiple Myeloma by four of the most popular purification methods and assessed the presence of residual contaminants in the preparations through an ad hoc combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques - including Western Blot, colloidal nanoplasmonics, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning helium ion microscopy (HIM). The preparations obtained by iodixanol and sucrose gradients were highly pure. To the contrary, those achieved with limited processing (serial centrifugation or one step precipitation kit) resulted contaminated by a residual matrix, embedding the exosomes. The contaminated preparations showed lower ability to induce NfkB nuclear translocation in endothelial cells with respect to the pure ones, probably because the matrix prevents the interaction and fusion of the exosomes with the cell membrane. These findings suggest that exosome preparation purity must be carefully assessed since it may interfere with exosome biological activity. Contaminants can be reliably probed only by an integrated characterization approach aimed at both the molecular and the colloidal length scales.	PMC4806376

Interaction of the LILRB1 inhibitory receptor with HLA class Ia dimers.	Eur J Immunol	2016	Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 1 (LILRB1) has been reported to interact with a wide spectrum of HLA class I (HLA-I) molecules, albeit with different affinities determined by allelic polymorphisms and conformational features. HLA-G dimerization and the presence of intracellular Cys residues in HLA-B7 have been shown to be critical for their recognition by LILRB1. We hypothesized that dimerization of classical HLA class Ia molecules, previously detected in exosomes, might enhance their interaction with LILRB1. A soluble LILRB1-Fc fusion protein and a sensitive cellular reporter system expressing a LILRB1-ζ chimera were employed to assess receptor interaction with different HLA class Ia molecules transfected in the human lymphoblastoid 721.221 cell line. Under these conditions, intracellular Cys residues and HLA-I dimerization appeared associated with increased LILRB1 recognition. On the other hand, a marginal interaction of LILRB1 with primary monocytic cells, irrespective of their high HLA-I expression, was enhanced by type I interferon (IFN). This effect appeared disproportionate to the cytokine-induced increase of surface HLA-I expression and was accompanied by detection of HLA class Ia dimers. Altogether, the results support that a regulated assembly of these noncanonical HLA-I conformers during the immune response may enhance the avidity of their interaction with LILRB1.

Molecular characterization of S. japonicum exosome-like vesicles reveals their regulatory roles in parasite-host interactions.	Sci Rep	2016	Secreted extracellular vesicles play an important role in pathogen-host interactions. Increased knowledge of schistosome extracellular vesicles could provide insights into schistosome-host interactions and enable the development of novel intervention strategies to inhibit parasitic processes and lessen disease transmission. Here, we describe biochemical characterization of Schistosoma japonicum exosome-like vesicles (S. japonicum EVs). A total of 403 proteins were identified in S. japonicum EVs, and bioinformatics analyses indicated that these proteins were mainly involved in binding, catalytic activity, and translation regulatory activity. Next, we characterized the population of small RNAs associated with S. japonicum EVs. Further studies demonstrated that mammalian cells could internalize S. japonicum EVs and transfer their cargo miRNAs to recipient cells. Additionally, we found that a specific miRNA, likely originating from a final host, ocu-miR-191-5p, is also associated with S. japonicum EVs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that S. japonicum EVs could be implicated in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis via a mechanism involving the transfer of their cargo miRNAs to hosts. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of schistosome-host interactions.	PMC4865838

J Cell Sci	2016	Angiogenesis plays crucial roles in various physiological processes including wound healing and tissue repair. It requires a tight interaction between endothelial cells and their surrounding environment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), one of the non-endothelial cell types present in the perivascular environment, have been shown to secret exosomes to modulate intercellular communications between MSCs and their target cells. In this study, we initially isolated exosomes secreted by human adipose-derived MSCs (adMSC-Exo) and examined their roles in angiogenesis. We found that adMSC-Exo could be taken up by endothelial cells and significantly promote angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo Further study showed that miR-125a was enriched in adMSC-Exo, and repressed the expression of the angiogenic inhibitor delta-like 4 (DLL4) by targeting its 3' untranslated region. Additionally, adMSC-Exo and its exosomal transferred miR-125a could repress DLL4 expression and modulate endothelial cell angiogenesis through promoting formation of endothelial tip cells. In conclusion, our study indicates that adMSC-Exo can transfer miR-125a to endothelial cells and promote angiogenesis by repressing DLL4. adMSC-Exo, as a pro-angiogenic factor, might be a promising candidate for therapeutical tissue repair.	
27348586	Adrian E Morelli				Donor dendritic cell-derived exosomes promote allograft-targeting immune response.	J Clin Invest	2016	The immune response against transplanted allografts is one of the most potent reactions mounted by the immune system. The acute rejection response has been attributed to donor dendritic cells (DCs), which migrate to recipient lymphoid tissues and directly activate alloreactive T cells against donor MHC molecules. Here, using a murine heart transplant model, we determined that only a small number of donor DCs reach lymphoid tissues and investigated how this limited population of donor DCs efficiently initiates the alloreactive T cell response that causes acute rejection. In our mouse model, efficient passage of donor MHC molecules to recipient conventional DCs (cDCs) was dependent on the transfer of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from donor DCs that migrated from the graft to lymphoid tissues. These EVs shared characteristics with exosomes and were internalized or remained attached to the recipient cDCs. Recipient cDCs that acquired exosomes became activated and triggered full activation of alloreactive T cells. Depletion of recipient cDCs after cardiac transplantation drastically decreased presentation of donor MHC molecules to directly alloreactive T cells and delayed graft rejection in mice. These findings support a key role for transfer of donor EVs in the generation of allograft-targeting immune responses and suggest that interrupting this process has potential to dampen the immune response to allografts.

Oncol Lett	2016	Members of the microRNA (miR)-183 family are expressed at high levels in the majority of cancer types, including breast and prostate, and are considered 'oncomiRs'. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of exosomes in cell-to-cell transfer of the miR-183 family, which includes miRs-96, -182 and -183. Despite highly detectable levels of these three miRs within prostate and breast cells in vitro, only miR-182 was detectable in exosomes isolated from cell culture supernatant. Similar to the in vitro results, miR-182 was the only miR detected in exosomes isolated from fresh human serum. The packaging of miR-182 into exosomes was examined in MDA-MB-231 (MDA-182) breast cancer cells with miR-182 overexpression. Levels of mature miR-182 increased in exosomes in a dose-dependent manner compared to intracellular expression. Furthermore, co-culture of MDA-182 cells with naïve MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in an increase in mature miR-182 in the naïve cells, which was blocked by a chemical inhibitor of microvesicle formation. In summary, the present study demonstrates that of the miR-183 family members, miR-182 is preferentially packaged in exosomes, detectable in exosomes from human sera and may be transferred between cells via a microvesicle-dependent mechanism.

Sci Rep	2016	Circulating endothelial microparticles (EMPs) are emerging as biomarkers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in individuals exposed to cigarette smoke (CS), but their mechanism of release and function remain unknown. We assessed biochemical and functional characteristics of EMPs and circulating microparticles (cMPs) released by CS. CS exposure was sufficient to increase microparticle levels in plasma of humans and mice, and in supernatants of primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells. CS-released EMPs contained predominantly exosomes that were significantly enriched in let-7d, miR-191; miR-126; and miR125a, microRNAs that reciprocally decreased intracellular in CS-exposed endothelium. CS-released EMPs and cMPs were ceramide-rich and required the ceramide-synthesis enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) for their release, an enzyme which was found to exhibit significantly higher activity in plasma of COPD patients or of CS-exposed mice. The ex vivo or in vivo engulfment of EMPs or cMPs by peripheral blood monocytes-derived macrophages was associated with significant inhibition of efferocytosis. Our results indicate that CS, via aSMase, releases circulating EMPs with distinct microRNA cargo and that EMPs affect the clearance of apoptotic cells by specialized macrophages. These targetable effects may be important in the pathogenesis of diseases linked to endothelial injury and inflammation in smokers.	PMC4987682

Circulating MicroRNAs in Graves' Disease in Relation to Clinical Activity.	Thyroid	2016	BACKGROUND: Understanding the roles of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) can provide important and novel information regarding disease pathogenesis and a patient's clinical condition. Circulating miRNAs, such as exosomal miRNA, may regulate various bioactivities related to intercellular communication. However, the circulation of miRNAs in Graves' disease (GD) in relation to disease activity has never been elucidated. This study aimed to identify circulating miRNAs in GD in relation to disease activity and whether their exosomes play a role in the pathogenesis of GD. METHODS: Circulating miRNAs were measured in serum obtained from seven intractable GD patients, seven GD patients in remission, and seven healthy controls using the miScript miRNA PCR Array. Altered miRNAs selected from array data were validated in 65 subjects. To investigate exosome biology, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were incubated with exosomes isolated from the subjects' sera. mRNAs were quantified for cytokines using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Circulating miR-23b-5p and miR-92a-39 were increased in GD patients in remission compared with intractable GD patients (p < 0.05). On the other hand, let-7g-3p and miR-339-5p were decreased in GD patients in remission compared with intractable GD patients (p < 0.05). Exosomes from intractable GD patients stimulated mRNA expression for IL-1β and TNF-α compared with GD patients in remission or healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that different levels of circulating miRNAs are associated with intractable GD. Moreover, serum exosomes of patients with intractable GD may activate immune cells, which may play an important role in GD pathogenesis.

Proteome Profiling of Urinary Exosomes Identifies Alpha 1-Antitrypsin and H2B1K as Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers for Urothelial Carcinoma.	Sci Rep	2016	MALDI-TOF spectrometry has not been used for urinary exosome analysis. We used it for determining UC biomarkers. From 2012 to 2015, we enrolled 129 consecutive patients with UC and 62 participants without UC. Exosomes from their urine were isolated, and analyzed through MALDI-TOF spectrometry. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of another 122 UC and 26 non-UC tissues was conducted to verify the discovered biomarkers. Two peaks at m/z 5593 (fragmented peptide of alpha-1-antitrypsin; sensitivity, 50.4%; specificity, 96.9%) and m/z 5947 (fragmented peptide of histone H2B1K sensitivity, 62.0%; specificity, 92.3%) were identified as UC diagnosis exosome biomarkers. UC patients with detectable histone H2B1K showed 2.29- and 3.11-fold increased risks of recurrence and progression, respectively, compared with those with nondetectable histone H2B1K. Verification results of IHC staining revealed significantly higher expression of alpha 1-antitrypsin (p = 0.038) and H2B1K (p = 0.005) in UC tissues than in normal tissues. The expression of alpha 1-antitrypsin and H2B1K in UC tissues was significantly correlated with UC grades (p < 0.05). Urinary exosome proteins alpha 1-antitrypsin and histone H2B1K, which are identified through MALDI-TOF analysis, could facilitate rapid diagnosis and prognosis of UC.	PMC5043375

Cultured mpkCCD cells were stained with CTX coupled to a green fluorophore in order to label the cell membranes and freshly isolated exosomes from LLC-PK1 cells were labeled with the red lipophilic dye PKH26 in order to visualize uptake of exosomes into the cells. Single-channel patch clamp recordings showed the open probability of ENaC in Xenopus 2F3 cells and in freshly isolated split-open tubules decreased in response to exogenous application of exosomes derived from LLC-PK1 proximal tubule cells. Active GAPDH was identified within exosomes derived from proximal tubule LLC-PK1 cells. The effect on ENaC activity in Xenopus 2F3 cells was blunted after application of exosomes transfected with the GAPDH inhibitor heptelidic acid. Also, we show GAPDH and ENaC subunits associate in mpkCCD cells. These studies examine a potential role for exosomes in the regulation of ENaC activity and examine a possible mechanism for communication from proximal tubule cells to distal tubule and collecting duct cells.

Circular RNAs are down-regulated in KRAS mutant colon cancer cells and can be transferred to exosomes.	Sci Rep	2016	Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant, widely expressed in mammals, and can display cell-type specific expression. However, how production of circRNAs is regulated and their precise biological function remains largely unknown. To study how circRNAs might be regulated during colorectal cancer progression, we used three isogenic colon cancer cell lines that differ only in KRAS mutation status. Cellular RNAs from the parental DLD-1 cells that contain both wild-type and G13D mutant KRAS alleles and isogenically-matched derivative cell lines, DKO-1 (mutant KRAS allele only) and DKs-8 (wild-type KRAS allele only) were analyzed using RNA-Seq. We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify and evaluate circRNA candidates from RNA-Seq data. Hundreds of high-quality circRNA candidates were identified in each cell line. Remarkably, circRNAs were significantly down-regulated at a global level in DLD-1 and DKO-1 cells compared to DKs-8 cells, indicating a widespread effect of mutant KRAS on circRNA abundance. This finding was confirmed in two independent colon cancer cell lines HCT116 (KRAS mutant) and HKe3 (KRAS WT). In all three cell lines, circRNAs were also found in secreted extracellular-vesicles, and circRNAs were more abundant in exosomes than cells. Our results suggest that circRNAs may serve as promising cancer biomarkers.	PMC5125100

Electronic address: .	mihaly.judith@ttk.mta.hu		Characterization of extracellular vesicles by IR spectroscopy: Fast and simple classification based on amide and CH stretching vibrations.	Biochim Biophys Acta	2017	Extracellular vesicles isolated by differential centrifugation from Jurkat T-cell line were investigated by attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Amide and CH stretching band intensity ratios calculated from IR bands, characteristic of protein and lipid components, proved to be distinctive for the different extracellular vesicle subpopulations. This proposed 'spectroscopic protein-to-lipid ratio', combined with the outlined spectrum-analysis protocol is valid also for low sample concentrations (0.15-0.05mg/ml total protein content) and can carry information about the presence of other non-vesicular formations such as aggregated proteins, lipoproteins and immune complexes. Detailed analysis of IR data reveals compositional changes of extracellular vesicles subpopulations: second derivative spectra suggest changes in protein composition from parent cell towards exosomes favoring proteins with β-turns and unordered motifs at the expense of intermolecular β-sheet structures. The IR-based protein-to-lipid assessment protocol was tested also for red blood cell derived microvesicles for which similar values were obtained. The potential applicability of this technique for fast and efficient characterization of vesicular components is high as the investigated samples require no further preparations and all the different molecular species can be determined in the same sample. The results indicate that ATR-FTIR measurements provide a simple and reproducible method for the screening of extracellular vesicle preparations. It is hoped that this sophisticated technique will have further impact in extracellular vesicle research.

J Virol	2017	Fibrogenic pathways in the liver are principally regulated by activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC). Fibrosis is associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, although the mechanism is poorly understood. HSC comprise the major population of nonparenchymal cells in the liver. Since HCV does not replicate in HSC, we hypothesized that exosomes secreted from HCV-infected hepatocytes activate HSC. Primary or immortalized human hepatic stellate (LX2) cells were exposed to exosomes derived from HCV-infected hepatocytes (HCV-exo), and the expression of fibrosis-related genes was examined. Our results demonstrated that HCV-exo internalized to HSC and increased the expression of profibrotic markers. Further analysis suggested that HCV-exo carry miR-19a and target SOCS3 in HSC, which in turn activates the STAT3-mediated transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway and enhances fibrosis marker genes. The higher expression of miR-19a in exosomes was also observed from HCV-infected hepatocytes and in sera of chronic HCV patients with fibrosis compared to healthy volunteers and non-HCV-related liver disease patients with fibrosis. Together, our results demonstrated that miR-19a carried through the exosomes from HCV-infected hepatocytes activates HSC by modulating the SOCS-STAT3 axis. Our results implicated a novel mechanism of exosome-mediated intercellular communication in the activation of HSC for liver fibrosis in HCV infection.IMPORTANCE HCV-associated liver fibrosis is a critical step for end-stage liver disease progression. However, the molecular mechanisms for hepatic stellate-cell activation by HCV-infected hepatocytes are underexplored. Here, we provide a role for miR-19a carried through the exosomes in intercellular communication between HCV-infected hepatocytes and HSC in fibrogenic activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the role of exosomal miR-19a in activation of the STAT3-TGF-β pathway in HSC. This study contributes to the understanding of intercellular communication in the pathogenesis of liver disease during HCV infection.	PMC5331806

BMC Cancer	2017	BACKGROUND: Multiple types of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes (EXOs), are released by all cells constituting part of the cellular EV secretome. The bioactive cargo of EVs can be shuffled between cells and consists of lipids, metabolites, proteins, and nucleic acids, including multiple RNA species from non-coding RNAs to messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In this study, we hypothesized that the mRNA cargo of EVs could differ based on the EV cellular origin and subpopulation analyzed. METHODS: We isolated MVs and EXOs from PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells by differential centrifugation and compared them to EVs derived from the benign PNT2 prostate cells. The relative mRNA levels of 84 prostate cancer-related genes were investigated and validated using quantitative reverse transcription PCR arrays. RESULTS: Based on the mRNA abundance, MVs rather than EXOs were enriched in the analyzed transcripts, providing a snapshot of the tumor transcriptome. LNCaP MVs specifically contained significantly increased mRNA levels of NK3 Homeobox 1 (NKX3-1), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and tumor protein 53 (TP53) genes, whereas PC-3 MVs carried increased mRNA levels of several genes including, caveolin-2 (CAV2), glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1), pescadillo ribosomal biogenesis factor 1 (PES1), calmodulin regulated spectrin associated protein 1 (CAMSAP1), zinc-finger protein 185 (ZNF185), and others compared to PNT2 MVs. Additionally, ETS variant 1 (ETV1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNAs identified in LNCaP- and PC-3- derived MVs highly correlated with prostate cancer progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new understandings of the variability of the mRNA cargo of MVs and EXOs from different cell lines despite same cancer origin, which is essential to better understand the the proportion of the cell transcriptome that can be detected within EVs and to evaluate their role in disease diagnosis.

Dendritic cells derived exosomes migration to spleen and induction of inflammation are regulated by CCR7.	Sci Rep	2017	Mature dendritic cells (DCs) home to secondary lymphoid organs through CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7). Exosomes derived from DCs (DC-exos) are reported to migrate to spleen and induce inflammation in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated that mature bone marrow DC-exos can activate immature DC and T cells in vitro. Then we intravenously injected DC-exos into C57BL/6 mice, observing that mature DC-exos accumulated more in spleen than immature DC-exos. These DC-exos in spleen could be uptaken by splenetic DCs and T cells and induce an inflammatory response. We further showed that the increased accumulation of mature DC-exos in spleen was regulated by CCR7, whose reduction led to a decrease of accumulation in spleen and attenuated inflammatory response in serum. These data provide us a new perspective to comprehensively understand exosomes, which might inherit some special functions from their parent cells and exert these functions in vivo.	PMC5320445

Exosomes and their role in the micro-/macro-environment: a comprehensive review.	J Biomed Res	2017	The importance of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in cell-cell communication has long been recognized due to their ability to transfer important cellular cargoes such as DNA, mRNA, miRNAs, and proteins to target cells. Compelling evidence supports the role of EVs in the horizontal transfer of cellular material which has the potential to influence normal cellular physiology and promote various disease states. Of the different types of EVs, exosomes have garnered much attention in the past decade due to their abundance in various biological fluids and ability to affect multiple organ systems. The main focus of this review will be on cancer and how cancer-derived exosomes are important mediators of metastasis, angiogenesis, immune modulation, and the tumor macro-/microenvironment. We will also discuss exosomes as potential biomarkers for cancers due to their abundance in biological fluids, ease of uptake, and cellular content. Exosome use in diagnosis, prognosis, and in establishing treatment regimens has enormous potential to revolutionize patient care.	PMC5706431

Schistosomal MicroRNAs Isolated From Extracellular Vesicles in Sera of Infected Patients: A New Tool for Diagnosis and Follow-up of Human Schistosomiasis.	J Infect Dis	2017	Background: Schistosomiasis traditionally has been diagnosed by detecting eggs in stool or urine. However, the sensitivity of these examinations is limited, especially in travelers with a low worm burden. Serologic tests have a greater sensitivity, but their results remain positive regardless of treatment and thus cannot be used for follow-up of patients. We hypothesized that detection of worm microRNAs (miRNAs) in serum can overcome the drawbacks of the existing diagnostic methods. Methods and Results: Twenty-six returning travelers with schistosomiasis (based on positive results of serologic tests or detection of ova) and 17 healthy controls were included in the study. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) amplification of miRNA extracted directly from 500 µL of serum had limited sensitivity and specificity. However, qRT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from 200 μL of serum extracellular vesicles detected 4 schistosomal miRNAs; the sensitivity and specificity of the 2 highest expressed miRNAs (bantam and miR-2c-3p) were 86% and 84%, respectively. In 7 patients with posttreatment serum available for analysis, we observed outcomes ranging from a reduction in the schistosomal miRNA level to full recovery from disease. Conclusions: qRT-PCR of pathogen miRNAs isolated from extracellular vesicles in sera from infected individuals may provide a new tool for diagnosing schistosomiasis in patients with a low parasite burden. This assay could also be used for evaluating the outcome of therapy, as well as disease-control programs.

PLoS One	2017	A putative novel rhabdovirus (SfRV) was previously identified in a Spodoptera frugiperda cell line (Sf9 cells [ATCC CRL-1711 lot 58078522]) by next generation sequencing and extensive bioinformatic analysis. We performed an extensive analysis of our Sf9 cell bank (ATCC CRL-1711 lot 5814 [Sf9L5814]) to determine whether this virus was already present in cells obtained from ATCC in 1987. Inverse PCR of DNA isolated from Sf9 L5814 cellular DNA revealed integration of SfRV sequences in the cellular genome. RT-PCR of total RNA showed a deletion of 320 nucleotides in the SfRV RNA that includes the transcriptional motifs for genes X and L. Concentrated cell culture supernatant was analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and revealed a single band at a density of 1.14 g/ml. This fraction was further analysed by electron microscopy and showed amorphous and particulate debris that did not resemble a rhabdovirus in morphology or size. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the protein composition did not contain the typical five rhabdovirus structural proteins and LC-MS/MS analysis revealed primarily of exosomal marker proteins, the SfRV N protein, and truncated forms of SfRV N, P, and G proteins. The SfRV L gene fragment RNA sequence was recovered from the supernatant after ultracentrifugation of the 1.14 g/ml fraction treated with diethyl ether suggesting that the SfRV L gene fragment sequence is not associated with a diethyl ether resistant nucleocapsid. Interestingly, the 1.14 g/ml fraction was able to transfer baculovirus DNA into Sf9L5814 cells, consistent with the presence of functional exosomes. Our results demonstrate the absence of viral particles in ATCC CRL-1711 lot 5814 Sf9 cells in contrast to a previous study that suggested the presence of infectious rhabdoviral particles in Sf9 cells from a different lot. This study highlights how cell lines with different lineages may present different virosomes and therefore no general conclusions can be drawn across Sf9 cells from different laboratories.	PMC5397025
28485529	Benjamin S Bleier	Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.			Exosomes mediate interepithelial transfer of functional P-glycoprotein in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.	Laryngoscope	2017	OBJECTIVE: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drives type-2 helper T-cell inflammation in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) through unknown posttranslational mechanisms of overexpression. A recent randomized clinical trial demonstrated that inhibition of P-gp was as effective as oral steroids and biologics in treating CRSwNP. Exosomes are 30- to 150-nm vesicles capable of intercellular membrane protein transfer. The aims of this study were 1) to determine whether CRSwNP mucus exosomes are enriched with P-gp, and 2) whether exosomal P-gp can be functionally transferred to autologous epithelial cells as a putative mechanism for the proinflammatory overexpression of P-gp in CRSwNP. STUDY DESIGN: Institutional review board-approved study in CRSwNP and control patients (n = 10 per group). METHODS: P-gp content of purified mucus exosomes was characterized by transmission electron microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Epithelial transfer of exosomal P-gp was determined by time-lapse fluorescent microscopy and calcein acetoxymethylester functional P-gp assay. RESULTS: CD63+/P-gp+ exosomes were detected in both groups. P-gp was significantly enriched in CRSwNP exosomes relative to control (median 198.5; interquartile range 123.6-270.5 vs. 74.4; 41.3-95.0 pcg P-gp/109 exosomes, P = 0.002). Exosomes were absorbed by epithelial cells within 10 minutes, resulting in a significant increase in P-gp activity in CRSwNP patients relative to control (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Here we demonstrate the presence and P-gp enrichment of mucus-derived exosomes, or rhinosomes, in CRSwNP. These rhinosomes are capable of rapid intercellular transfer of P-gp, leading to increased P-gp function within recipient cells. This represents a novel mechanism for maintaining P-gp overexpression in CRSwNP, and more generally for interepithelial transfer of other proteins between mucosal epithelial cells.

Exosomes From Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Protect the Myocardium Against Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Through Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.	J Cardiovasc Pharmacol	2017	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secreted exosomes exert a cardioprotective role in jeopardized myocardium. However, the specific effects and underlying mechanisms of exosomes derived from adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remain largely unclear. In this study, ADMSC-derived exosomes (ADMSCs-ex) were administrated into the rats subjected to I/R injury and H9c2 cells exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Consequently, administration of ADMSCs-ex significantly reduced I/R-induced myocardial infarction, accompanied with a decrease in serum levels of creatine kinase-myocardial band, lactate dehydrogenase, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Simultaneously, ADMSCs-ex dramatically antagonized I/R-induced myocardial apoptosis, along with the upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bax, and inhibition of Caspase 3 activity in rat myocardium. Similarly, ADMSCs-ex significantly reduced cell apoptosis and the expression of Bax, but markedly increased cell viability and the expression of Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1 under H/R. Furthermore, ADMSCs-ex observably induced the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by attenuating I/R- and H/R-induced inhibition of Wnt3a, p-GSK-3β (Ser9), and β-catenin expression. Importantly, treatment with Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor XAV939 partly neutralized ADMSC-ex-induced antiapoptotic and prosurvival effects in H9c2 cells. In conclusion, we confirmed that ADMSCs-ex protect ischemic myocardium from I/R injury through the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.	PMC5642342

Identification of exosomal muscle-specific miRNAs in serum of myotonic dystrophy patients relating to muscle disease progress.	Hum Mol Genet	2017	Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common form of adult-onset muscular dystrophy, which is characterised by progressive muscle wasting and the discovery of reliable blood-based biomarkers could be useful for the disease progress monitoring. There have been some reports showing that the presence of specific miRNAs in blood correlates with DM1. In one of these, our group identified four muscle-specific miRNAs, miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b and miR-206, which correlated with the progression of muscle wasting observed in DM1 patients. The levels of the four muscle-specific miRNAs were elevated in the serum of DM1 patients compared to healthy participants and were also elevated in the serum of progressive muscle wasting DM1 patients compared to disease-stable DM1 patients. The aim of this work was to characterise the ontology of these four muscle-specific miRNAs in the blood circulation of DM1 patients. Here we show that the four muscle-specific miRNAs are encapsulated within exosomes isolated from DM1 patients. Our results show for the first time, the presence of miRNAs encapsulated within exosomes in blood circulation of DM1 patients. More interestingly, the levels of the four exosomal muscle-specific miRNAs are associated with the progression of muscle wasting in DM1 patients. We propose that exosomal muscle-specific miRNAs may be useful molecular biomarkers for monitoring the progress of muscle wasting in DM1 patients. There has been a growing interest regarding the clinical applications of exosomes and their role in prognosis and therapy of various diseases and the above results contribute towards this way.

Sci Rep	2017	The retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood-retinal barrier in the eye and its polarity is responsible for directional secretion and uptake of proteins, lipoprotein particles and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Such a secretional division dictates directed interactions between the systemic circulation (basolateral) and the retina (apical). Our goal is to define the polarized proteomes and physical characteristics of EVs released from the RPE. Primary cultures of porcine RPE cells were differentiated into polarized RPE monolayers on permeable supports. EVs were isolated from media bathing either apical or basolateral RPE surfaces, and two subpopulations of small EVs including exosomes, and dense EVs, were purified and processed for proteomic profiling. In parallel, EV size distribution and concentration were determined. Using protein correlation profiling mass spectrometry, a total of 631 proteins were identified in exosome preparations, 299 of which were uniquely released apically, and 94 uniquely released basolaterally. Selected proteins were validated by Western blot. The proteomes of these exosome and dense EVs preparations suggest that epithelial polarity impacts directional release. These data serve as a foundation for comparative studies aimed at elucidating the role of exosomes in the molecular pathophysiology of retinal diseases and help identify potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers.

Sci Rep	2017	Cancer patients are at an increased risk of developing thromboembolic complications. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain cancer-associated thrombosis including the release of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles and the activation of host vascular cells. It was proposed that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to the prothrombotic phenotype in cancer. In this study, we evaluated the possible cooperation between tumor-derived exosomes and NETs in cancer-associated thrombosis. Female BALB/c mice were orthotopically injected with 4T1 breast cancer cells. The tumor-bearing animals exhibited increased levels of plasma DNA and myeloperoxidase in addition to significantly increased numbers of circulating neutrophils. Mice were subjected to either Rose Bengal/laser-induced venous thrombosis or ferric chloride-induced arterial thrombosis models. The tumor-bearing mice exhibited accelerated thrombus formation in both models compared to tumor-free animals. Treatment with recombinant human DNase 1 reversed the prothrombotic phenotype of tumor-bearing mice in both models. Remarkably, 4T1-derived exosomes induced NET formation in neutrophils from mice treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). In addition, tumor-derived exosomes interacted with NETs under static conditions. Accordingly, the intravenous administration of 4T1-derived exosomes into G-CSF-treated mice significantly accelerated venous thrombosis in vivo. Taken together, our observations suggest that tumor-derived exosomes and neutrophils may act cooperatively in the establishment of cancer-associated thrombosis.	PMC5526939

The inherent complexity of EVs is a source of heterogeneity in various potential applications of the biological nanovesicles including analysis. To diminish heterogeneity, EV should be isolated and separated according to their sizes and cargos. However, current technologies do not meet the requirements. We showed noninvasive and precise separation of EVs based on their sizes without any recognizable damages. We separated atto-liter volumes of biological nanoparticles through operation of the present system showing relatively large volume of sample treatment to milliliters within an hour.

Comprehensive proteomics analysis of exosomes derived from human seminal plasma.	Andrology	2017	Exosomes are membranous nanovesicles of endocytic origin that carry and transfer regulatory bioactive molecules and mediate intercellular communication between cells and tissues. Although seminal exosomes have been identified in human seminal plasma, their exact composition and possible physiologic function remain unknown. The objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive proteomics analysis of exosomes derived from human seminal plasma. Seminal exosomes were isolated and purified from 12 healthy donors using a 30% sucrose cushion-based exosome-isolation protocol, followed by characterization by western blot, transmission electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis before performing extensive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry proteomics analysis. The identified proteins were analyzed by bioinformatics analysis, and seminal exosomes-associated proteins were selectively validated by western blot. A total of 1474 proteins were identified in all seminal exosomes samples, with Gene Ontology analysis demonstrating that these identified seminal exosomes-associated proteins were mostly linked to 'exosomes,' 'cytoplasm,' and 'cytosol.' Bioinformatics analysis indicated that these proteins were mainly involved in biologic processes, including metabolism, energy pathways, protein metabolism, cell growth and maintenance, and transport. Of these identified proteins, PHGDH, LGALS3BP, SEMG1, ACTB, GAPDH, and the exosomal-marker protein ALIX were validated by western blot. This study provided a more comprehensive description of the seminal exosomes proteome and could also be a resource for further screening of biomarkers and comparative proteomics studies, including those associated with male infertility and prostate cancer.

Neoplasia	2017	There have been no reports describing the effects of cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) on three-dimensional organoids. In this study, we delineated the proneoplastic effects of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)-derived EVs on gastric organoids (gastroids) and elucidated molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. EVs were identified using PKH-67 staining. Morphologic changes, Ki-67 immunochemistry, cell viability, growth rates, and expression levels of miR-25 and miR-210, as well as of their target mRNAs, were determined in gastroids co-cultured with EAC-derived extracellular vesicles (c-EVs). C-EVs were efficiently taken up by gastroids. Notably, c-EV-treated gastroids were more crowded, compact, and multilayered and contained smaller lumens than did those cultured in organoid medium alone or in EAC-conditioned medium that had been depleted of EVs. Moreover, c-EV-treated gastroids manifested increased proliferation and cellular viability relative to medium-only or EV-depleted controls. Expression levels of miR-25 and miR-210 were significantly higher, and those of PTEN and AIFM3 significantly lower, in c-EV-treated versus medium-only or EV-depleted control groups. Inhibitors of miR-25 and miR-210 reversed the increased cell proliferation induced by c-exosomes in co-cultured gastroids by lowering miR-25 and miR-210 levels. In conclusion, we have constructed a novel model system featuring the co-culture of c-EVs with three-dimensional gastroids. Using this model, we discovered that cancer-derived EVs induce a neoplastic phenotype in gastroids. These changes are due, at least in part, to EV transfer of miR-25 and miR-210.	PMC5633352

Eur Biophys J	2017	A new communication route among cells was reported in recent years, via extracellular vesicles and their cargo. Exosomes in particular are attracting increasing interest as privileged mediators of this cell communication route. The exosome-mediated transfer of nucleic acids, especially of microRNAs, is particularly promising for their use both as biomarkers of pathologies and as a therapeutic tool. Here, a simplified model of interaction among cells, microRNAs and vesicles is studied using a biophysical approach. A synthetic and fluorescent microRNA (i.e. miR-1246 conjugated with TAMRA) was selected to model cell communication, monitoring its internalization in cells. The fluorescent miR-1246, either naked or included in synthetic or natural vesicles, was incubated with human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF7) for different times. A comparison between this human microRNA and its DNA copy or an exogenous microRNA (from Caenorhabditis elegans) allowed assessment of the specificity of the information transfer through microRNAs, and especially associated with exosomes. The uptake of naked miR-1246 was indeed higher both in terms of number of targeted cells and intensity of fluorescence signal with respect to the other nucleic acids tested. The same occurred with miR-1246 loaded exosomes, evidencing a specific uptake only partially due to the lipidic components and present only when the human microRNA was loaded in exosomes, which were themselves derived from the same MCF7 cells.

So far, biomarkers for pathological conditions have been mainly searched from their protein, (mi)RNA, DNA and lipid cargo. Here, we explored the small molecule metabolites from urinary and platelet EVs relative to their matched source samples. As a proof-of-concept study of intra-EV metabolites, we compared alternative normalization methods to profile urinary EVs from prostate cancer patients before and after prostatectomy and from healthy controls. METHODS: We employed targeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to profile over 100 metabolites in the isolated EVs, original urine samples and platelets. We determined the enrichment of the metabolites in the EVs and analyzed their subcellular origin, pathways and relevant enzymes or transporters through data base searches. EV- and urine-derived factors and ratios between metabolites were tested for normalization of the metabolomics data. RESULTS: Approximately 1 x 1010 EVs were sufficient for detection of metabolite profiles from EVs. The profiles of the urinary and platelet EVs overlapped with each other and with those of the source materials, but they also contained unique metabolites. The EVs enriched a selection of cytosolic metabolites including members from the nucleotide and spermidine pathways, which linked to a number of EV-resident enzymes or transporters. Analysis of the urinary EVs from the patients indicated that the levels of glucuronate, D-ribose 5-phosphate and isobutyryl-L-carnitine were 2-26-fold lower in all pre-prostatectomy samples compared to the healthy control and post-prostatectomy samples (p < 0.05). These changes were only detected from EVs by normalization to EV-derived factors or with metabolite ratios, and not from the original urine samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that metabolite analysis of EVs from different samples is feasible using a high-throughput platform and relatively small amount of sample material. With the knowledge about the specific enrichment of metabolites and normalization methods, EV metabolomics could be used to gain novel biomarker data not revealed by the analysis of the original EV source materials.

PDAC-derived exosomes enrich the microenvironment in MDSCs in a SMAD4-dependent manner through a new calcium related axis.	Oncotarget	2017	Tumor genetics and escape from immune surveillance concur in the poor prognosis of PDAC. In this study an experimental model was set up to verify whether SMAD4, deleted in about 55% PDAC and associated with poor prognosis, is involved in determining immunosuppression through Exosomes (Exo). Potential mechanisms and mediators underlying SMAD4-dependent immunosuppression were evaluated by studying intracellular calcium (Fluo-4), Exo-miRNAs (microarray) and Exo-proteins (SILAC). Two PDAC cell lines expressing (BxPC3-SMAD4+) or not-expressing (BxPC3) SMAD4 were used to prepare Exo-enriched conditioned media, employed in experiments with blood donors PBMCs. Exo expanded myeloid derived suppressor cells (gMDSC and mMDSC, flow cytometry) and altered intracellular calcium fluxes in an SMAD4 dependent manner. BxPC3-SMAD4+, but mainly BxPC3 Exo, increased calcium fluxes of PBMCs (p = 0.007) and this increased intracellular calcium trafficking characterized mMDSCs. The analysis of de-regulated Exo-miRNAs and transfection experiments revealed hsa-miR-494-3p and has-miR-1260a as potential mediators of SMAD4-associated de-regulated calcium fluxes. Eleven main biological processes were identified by the analysis of SMAD4-associated de-regulated Exo-proteins, including translation, cell adhesion, cell signaling and glycolysis. A reverse Warburg effect was observed by treating PBMCs with PDAC-derived Exo: BxPC3 Exo induced a higher glucose consumption and lactate production than BxPC3-SMAD4+ Exo. CONCLUSION: PDAC-derived Exo from cells with, but mainly from those without SMAD4 expression, create an immunosuppressive myeloid cell background by increasing calcium fluxes and glycolysis through the transfer of SMAD4-related differentially expressed miRNAs and proteins.

Exosome-Modified Tissue Engineered Blood Vessel for Endothelial Progenitor Cell Capture and Targeted siRNA Delivery.	Macromol Biosci	2018	Instability and poor targeting causes the long-term patency of RNA-modified tissue engineering blood vessels (TEBVs) remaining unsatisfactory. RNA can be enriched in exosome and then delivered into targeted cells while whether exosome-modified TEBVs achieve RNA targeted delivery is unclear. Here, to promote the expression of klotho protein on the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes, klotho plasmids are first transfected into MSCs, and adenosine kinase (ADK) siRNA is then loaded into exosome (klotho/ADK siRNA-exosome) using electrotransfection. Flow chamber results show that klotho/ADK siRNA-exosome can effectively capture circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Besides, the captured EPCs can endocytose this exosome, and then decompose it into klotho protein and ADK siRNA. Moreover, ADK siRNA promotes the paracrine of proangiogenic factors and adenosine from EPCs, which further facilitate proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Based on polyethyleneimine-capped gold nanoparticles, exosome-modified TEBVs are constructed through layer-by-layer assembly. Animal experimental results show that klotho/ADK siRNA-exosome-modified TEBVs can maintain the patency up to one month, and good endothelialization is observed. In short, one exosome-modified TEBV is constructed, capture molecules on the surface of exosome capture the circulating EPCs, and the loaded RNA achieves its purpose of accurate treatment depending on the needs of patients.

J Mol Med (Berl)	2018	We recently described a novel biotechnological platform for the production of unrestricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) vaccines. It relies on in vivo engineering of exosomes, i.e., nanovesicles constitutively released by all cells, with full-length antigens of choice upon fusion with an exosome-anchoring protein referred to as Nefmut. They are produced upon intramuscular injection of a DNA vector and, when uploaded with a viral tumor antigen, were found to elicit an immune response inhibiting the tumor growth in a model of transplantable tumors. However, for a possible application in cancer immunotherapy, a number of key issues remained unmet. Among these, we investigated: (i) whether the immunogenic stimulus induced by the engineered exosomes can break immune tolerance, and (ii) their effectiveness when applied in human system. As a model of immune tolerance, we considered mice transgenic for the expression of activated rat HER2/neu which spontaneously develop adenocarcinomas in all mammary glands. When these mice were injected with a DNA vector expressing the product of fusion between Nefmut and the extracellular domain of HER2/neu, antigen-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes became readily detectable. This immune response associated with a HER2-directed CTL activity and a significant delay in tumor development. On the other hand, through cross-priming experiments, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the engineered exosomes emerging from transfected human primary muscle cells in inducing antigen-specific CTLs. We propose our CTL vaccine platform as part of new immunotherapy strategies against tumors expressing self-antigens, i.e., products highly expressed in oncologic lesions but tolerated by the immune system. KEY MESSAGES: We established a novel, exosome-based method to produce unrestricted CTL vaccines. This strategy is effective in breaking the tolerance towards tumor self-antigens. Our method is also useful to elicit antigen-specific CTL immunity in humans. These findings open the way towards the use of this antitumor strategy in clinic.

Sci Rep	2018	Exosomes are microvesicles known to carry biologically active molecules, including RNA, DNA and proteins. Viral infections can induce profound changes in exosome composition, and exosomes have been implicated in viral transmission and pathogenesis. No information is current available regarding exosome composition and function during infection with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), the most important cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children. In this study, we characterized exosomes released from RSV-infected lung carcinoma-derived A549 cells. RNA deep sequencing revealed that RSV exosomes contain a diverse range of RNA species like messenger and ribosomal RNA fragments, as well as small noncoding RNAs, in a proportion different from exosomes isolated from mock-infected cells. We observed that both RNA and protein signatures of RSV were present in exosomes, however, they were not able to establish productive infection in uninfected cells. Exosomes isolated from RSV-infected cells were able to activate innate immune response by inducing cytokine and chemokine release from human monocytes and airway epithelial cells. These data suggest that exosomes may play an important role in pathogenesis or protection against disease, therefore understating their role in RSV infection may open new avenues for target identification and development of novel therapeutics.

Eur J Pharmacol	2018	Diabetic nephropathy is the most common microvascular complications of diabetes. Berberine is the main active ingredient of Coptis chinensis and previous studies have been showed that berberine could delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy by regulating related cytokines and signaling pathways. Glomerular mesangial cells and podocytes are two vital indigenous cells of kidney and interaction between these two cellular components via exosomes might affect function of glomerulus in diabetic nephropathy condition. On the basis of our previous studies, transwell systems were used to demonstrate that the exosomes released by glomerular mesangial cells induced by the high glucose were involved in podocytes injury. The current study demonstrates that berberine can reduce TGFβ1 in exosomes released by high glucose-induced glomerular mesangial cells. Berberine-treated high glucose-induced exosomes which are secreted by glomerular mesangial cells can protect damage of podocytes by reducing apoptosis and increasing adhesion. These results suggest that berberine could protect the function of podocytes through inhibiting the transfer of TGFβ1 from the glomerular mesangial cells to the podocytes, which is one of the potential mechanisms of protective effect of berberine on diabetic nephropathy.

Exosomes, a key component of paracrine secretion, have emerged as important players in the modulation of angiogenesis. The role of dental pulp cell-derived exosomes (DPC-Exos) in angiogenesis has rarely been reported. The proangiogenic properties of DPC-Exos in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are investigated in the current study. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from dental pulp cell (DPC) culture supernatants by ultracentrifugation and were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Western blotting, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Their roles in HUVEC proliferation, proangiogenic factor expression, and tube formation were examined in vitro. RESULTS: We isolated and characterized exosomes from DPCs and showed that DPC-Exos promoted HUVEC proliferation, proangiogenic factor expression, and tube formation. Furthermore, we found that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling inhibition enhances DPC-Exos-induced tube formation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that DPC-Exos have vital roles in angiogenesis, and p38 MAPK signaling inhibition enhances tubular morphogenesis.

J Pathol	2018	Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against bullous pemphigoid autoantigens, leading to dermal-epidermal separation with consequent blister formation. However, whether and how the components of blister fluid exacerbate the progression of bullous pemphigoid is unclear. Exosomes are nanometre-sized vesicles released from cells into the body fluid, where they can transmit signals throughout the body. In the present study, we isolated and characterized exosomes from blister fluids of patients with bullous pemphigoid, evaluated their proinflammatory role, and identified the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that exosomes isolated from blister fluids of patients with bullous pemphigoid showed the expected size and expressed the marker proteins CD63, CD81, and CD9. Additionally, blister fluid-derived exosomes were internalized by human primary keratinocytes, inducing the production of critical inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Western blotting analysis showed robust and rapid activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signalling pathways in human primary keratinocytes after stimulation with blister fluid-derived exosomes. We also found that blister fluid-derived exosomes indirectly induced neutrophil trafficking by upregulating C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 in vitro. Furthermore, CD63 was localized mostly to keratinocytes and infiltrative granulocytes in skin lesions, suggesting that these cells were the possible sources of exosomes in blister fluid. Using mass spectrometry, we analysed the proteomes of blister fluid-derived exosomes and identified a variety of proteins implicated in inflammatory and immune responses. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that blister fluid-derived exosomes are involved in the local autoinflammatory responses of the skin associated with bullous pemphigoid.

Secretory microRNA-29 expression in gingival crevicular fluid during orthodontic tooth movement.	PLoS One	2018	Secretory microRNAs (miRNAs) have been used increasingly as biomarkers for cancers, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases. They are reported as being freely circulated or encapsulated in microvesicles such as exosomes. This study was performed to elucidate the presence of miRNAs with exosomes in human gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), and the expression profile of miRNA-29 during orthodontic tooth movement. Four healthy volunteer and fifteen orthodontic patients were enrolled in the study. Secretory miRNA in GCF was collected and analyzed using a bioanalyzer, realtime PCR and Western blot analysis. The expression profile of secretory miR-29 family in GCF was analyzed during the course of canine retraction for 6 weeks. The results demonstrated the presence of miRNAs in the GCF. After series of ultracentrifugation and RT-PCR array, exosome-depleted fractions and pellets were isolated and we found that secretory miRNAs were detected in both the exosome-associated fraction and the exosome-depleted supernatant fraction; however, the concentration of miRNAs was higher in the exosome-associated fraction than in the exosome-depleted fraction suggesting a close association between the secretory miRNAs and exosomes in GCF. We also demonstrated the increased expression profiles of miR-29 family during six weeks of orthodontic tooth movement in humans. Secretory miRNAs are present in GCF and secretory miRNA-29 family expression profiles increase during the tooth movement in humans. Secretory miRNA-29 in GCF could serve as potential biomarkers for periodontal remodeling.	PMC5843286

The role of PTRF/Cavin1 as a biomarker in both glioma and serum exosomes.	Theranostics	2018	Exosomes play critical roles in intercellular communication in both nearby and distant cells in individuals and organs. Polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF), also known as Cavin1, has previously been described as a critical factor in caveola formation, and aberrant PTRF expression has been reported in various malignancies. However, the function of PTRF in tumor progression remains controversial, and its role in glioma is poorly understood. In this study, we report that PTRF is associated with malignancy grade and poor prognosis in glioma patients. Our previous study using two proteomics methods, tandem mass tag (TMT) and data-independent acquisition (DIA), showed that EGFRvIII overexpression increased PTRF expression at the protein level. In contrast, blocking PI3K and AKT using LY294002 and MK-2206, respectively, decreased PTRF expression, showing that PTRF is regulated in the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway. ChIP-PCR analysis showed that PTRF is transcriptionally regulated by the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications. Furthermore, PTRF overexpression increased exosome secretion and induced cell growth in vitro. More importantly, overexpressing PTRF induced the malignancy of nearby cells in vivo, suggesting that PTRF alters the microenvironment through intercellular communication via exosomes. Furthermore, analysis of clinical samples showed a positive correlation between tumor grade and PTRF expression in both tumor tissues and exosomes isolated from blood harvested from glioma patients, and PTRF expression in exosomes isolated from the sera of GBM patients was decreased after surgery. In conclusion, PTRF serves as a promising biomarker in both tumor samples and serum exosomes, thus facilitating the detection of glioma and potentially serving as a therapeutic target for glioblastoma multiforme.

Molecules	2018	Exosomes are small vesicles which are produced by the cells and released into the surrounding space. They can transfer biomolecules into recipient cells. The main goal of the work was to study the exosome involvement in the cell transfer of hormonal resistance. The experiments were performed on in vitro cultured estrogen-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cells and MCF-7 sublines resistant to SERM tamoxifen and/or biguanide metformin, which exerts its anti-proliferative effect, at least in a part, via the suppression of estrogen machinery. The exosomes were purified by differential ultracentrifugation, cell response to tamoxifen was determined by MTT test, and the level and activity of signaling proteins were determined by Western blot and reporter analysis. We found that the treatment of the parent MCF-7 cells with exosomes from the resistant cells within 14 days lead to the partial resistance of the MCF-7 cells to antiestrogen drugs. The primary resistant cells and the cells with the exosome-induced resistance were characterized with these common features: decrease in ER&alpha; activity and parallel activation of Akt and AP-1, NF-&kappa;B, and SNAIL1 transcriptional factors. In general, we evaluate the established results as the evidence of the possible exosome involvement in the transferring of the hormone/metformin resistance in breast cancer cells.

Sci Rep	2018	Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a subpopulation of T cells that maintain tolerance to self and limit other immune responses. They achieve this through different mechanisms including the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes as shown by us, and others. One of the ways that Treg derived EVs inhibit target cells such as effector T cells is via the transfer of miRNA. Another key target for the immunoregulatory function of Tregs is the dendritic cells (DCs). In this study we demonstrate directly, and for the first time, that miRNAs are transferred from Tregs to DCs via Treg derived EVs. In particular two miRNAs, namely miR-150-5p and miR-142-3p, were increased in DCs following their interaction with Tregs and Treg derived exosomes. One of the consequences for DCs following the acquisition of miRNAs contained in Treg derived EVs was the induction of a tolerogenic phenotype in these cells, with increased IL-10 and decreased IL-6 production being observed following LPS stimulation. Altogether our findings provide data to support the idea that intercellular transfer of miRNAs via EVs may be a novel mechanism by which Tregs regulate DC function and could represent a mechanism to inhibit immune reactions in tissues.

J Dairy Sci	2018	The current study evaluated exosomes isolated from plasma of heifers bred to have high or low fertility through developing extreme diversity in fertility breeding values, however, key animal traits (e.g., body weight, milk production, and percentage of North American genetics) remained similar between the 2 groups. The exosomes were isolated by a combined ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography approach and characterized by their size distribution (nanoparticle tracking analysis), morphology (transmission electron microscopy), and presence of exosomal markers (immunoblotting). In addition, a targeted mass spectrometry approach was used to confirm the presence of 2 exosomal markers, tumor susceptibility gene 101 and flotillin 1. The number of exosomes from plasma of high fertility heifers was greater compared with low fertility heifers. Interestingly, the exosomal proteomic profile, evaluated using mass spectrometry, identified 89 and 116 proteins in the high and low fertility heifers respectively, of which 4 and 31 were unique, respectively. These include proteins associated with specific biological processes and molecular functions of fertility. Most notably, the tetratricopeptide repeat protein 41-related, glycodelin, and kelch-like protein 8 were identified in plasma exosomes unique to the low fertility heifers. These proteins are suggested to play a role in reproduction; however, the role of these proteins in dairy cow reproduction remains to be elucidated. Their identification underscores the potential for proteins within exosomes to provide information on the fertility status and physiological condition of the cow. This may potentially lead to the development of prognostic tools and interventions to improving dairy cow fertility.

Exosomes Secreted by Normoxic and Hypoxic Cardiosphere-derived Cells Have Anti-apoptotic Effect.	Iran J Pharm Res	2018	Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) have emerged as one of the most promising stem cell types for cardiac protection and repair. Exosomes are required for the regenerative effects of human CDCs and mimic the cardioprotective benefits of CDCs such as anti-apoptotic effect in animal myocardial infarction (MI) models. Here we aimed to investigate the anti-apoptotic effect of the hypoxic and normoxic human CDCs-derived exosomes on induced apoptosis in human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs). In this study, CDCs were cultured under normoxic (18% O2) and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions and CDC-exosomes were isolated from conditioned media by differential ultracentrifugation. Cobalt chloride as hypoxia-mimetic agents at a high concentration was used to induce apoptosis in hESC-CMs. The caspase-3/7 activity was determined in apoptosis-induced hESC-CMs. The results indicated that the caspase-positive hESC-CMs were significantly decreased from 30.63 ± 1.44% (normalized against untreated cardiomyocytes) to 1.65 ± 0.1 and 1.1 ± 1.09 in the presence of normoxic exosomes (N-exo) at concentration of 25 and 50 μg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, hypoxic exosomes (H-exo) at concentration of 25 and 50 μg/mL led to 8.75 and 12.86 % reduction in caspase-positive cells, respectively. The anti-apoptotic activity of N-exo at the concentrations of 25 and 50 μg/mL was significantly higher than H-exo. These results could provide insights into optimal preparation of CDCs which would greatly influence the anti-apoptotic effect of CDC-exosomes. Totally, CDC-secreted exosomes have the potential to increase the survival of cardiomyocytes by inhibiting apoptosis. Therefore, CDC-exosomes can be developed as therapeutic strategy in ischemic cardiac disease.	PMC5937107

Nat Immunol	2002	Dendritic cells (DCs) secrete vesicles of endosomal origin, called exosomes, that bear major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T cell costimulatory molecules. Here, we found that injection of antigen- or peptide-bearing exosomes induced antigen-specific naïve CD4+ T cell activation in vivo. In vitro, exosomes did not induce antigen-dependent T cell stimulation unless mature CD8alpha- DCs were also present in the cultures. These mature DCs could be MHC class II-negative, but had to bear CD80 and CD86. Therefore, in addition to carrying antigen, exosomes promote the exchange of functional peptide-MHC complexes between DCs. Such a mechanism may increase the number of DCs bearing a particular peptide, thus amplifying the initiation of primary adaptive immune responses.

J Biol Chem	2005	The heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of intracellular proteins found in all eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Their functions are well characterized and are central to maintaining cellular homeostasis and in promoting cell survival in response to stressful cellular conditions. However, several studies provide evidence that specific members of the HSP family might be secreted via an unidentified exocytotic pathway. Here we show that exosomes, small membrane vesicles that are secreted by numerous cell types, contribute to the release of HSP70 from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in both basal and stress-induced (heat shock at 40 or 43 degrees C for 1 h) states. HSP70 release from PBMCs is independent of the common secretory pathway because Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of the classical protein transport pathway, did not block HSP70 release. Furthermore, we show that HSP70 release from PBMCs does not occur via a lipid raft-dependent pathway, because treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, a raft-disrupting drug, had no affect on HSP70 release. To examine whether exosomes contributed to HSP70 release from PBMCs, exosomes were purified from PBMC cultures, and exosomal number and HSP70 content were determined. We demonstrate that although heat shock does not influence the exosomal secretory rate, the HSP70 content of exosomes isolated from heat shocked PBMCs is significantly higher than control. These data identify a novel secretory pathway by which HSP70 can be actively released from cells in both the basal and stress-induced state.

EMBO Rep	2006	Recent developments in purification strategies, together with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, have identified numerous in vivo protein complexes and suggest the existence of many others. Standard proteomics techniques are, however, unable to describe the overall stoichiometry, subunit interactions and organization of these assemblies, because many are heterogeneous, are present at relatively low cellular abundance and are frequently difficult to isolate. We combine two existing methodologies to tackle these challenges: tandem affinity purification to isolate sufficient quantities of highly pure native complexes, and MS of the intact assemblies and subcomplexes to determine their structural organization. We optimized our protocol with two protein assemblies from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (scavenger decapping and nuclear cap-binding complexes), establishing subunit stoichiometry and identifying substoichiometric binding. We then targeted the yeast exosome, a nuclease with ten different subunits, and found that by generating subcomplexes, a three-dimensional interaction map could be derived, demonstrating the utility of our approach for large, heterogeneous cellular complexes.

Exosomes released from infected macrophages contain Mycobacterium avium glycopeptidolipids and are proinflammatory.	J Biol Chem	2007	Mycobacterium avium is a major opportunistic pathogen in HIV-positive individuals and is responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in AIDS patients. M. avium express glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) as a major cell wall constituent, and recent studies suggest that GPLs play an important role in M. avium pathogenesis. In the present study we show that M. avium-infected macrophages release GPLs, which are trafficked from the phagosome through the endocytic network to multivesicular bodies. Prior studies have shown that multivesicular bodies can fuse with the plasma membrane releasing small 50 to 100 nm vesicles known as exosomes. We found that M. avium-infected macrophages release exosomes containing GPLs leading to the transfer of GPLs from infected to uninfected macrophages. Interestingly, exosomes isolated from M. avium-infected but not from uninfected macrophages can stimulate a proinflammatory response in resting macrophages. This proinflammatory response is dependent on Toll like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4, and MyD88 suggesting that released exosomes contain M. avium-expressed TLR ligands. Our studies are the first to demonstrate that exosomes isolated from mycobacteria-infected macrophages can induce a proinflammatory response, and we hypothesize that exosomes play an important role in immune surveillance during intracellular bacteria infections.

Identification of breast cancer peptide epitopes presented by HLA-A*0201.	J Proteome Res	2008	Cellular immune mechanisms detect and destroy cancerous and infected cells via the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules that present peptides of intracellular origin on the surface of all nucleated cells. The identification of novel, tumor-specific epitopes is a critical step in the development of immunotherapeutics for breast cancer. To directly identify peptide epitopes unique to cancerous cells, secreted human class I HLA molecules (sHLA) were constructed by deletion of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of HLA A*0201. The resulting sHLA-A*0201 was transferred and expressed in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and BT-20 as well as in the immortal, nontumorigenic cell line MCF10A. Stable transfectants were seeded into bioreactors for production of > 25 mg of sHLA-A*0201. Peptides eluted from affinity purified sHLA were analyzed by mass spectroscopy. Comparative analysis of HLA-A*0201 peptides revealed 5 previously uncharacterized epitopes uniquely presented on breast cancer cells. These peptides were derived from intracellular proteins with either well-defined or putative roles in breast cancer development and progression: Cyclin Dependent Kinase 2 (Cdk2), Ornithine Decarboxylase (ODC1), Kinetochore Associated 2 (KNTC2 or HEC1), Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF), and Exosome Component 6 (EXOSC6). Cellular recognition of the MIF, KNTC2, EXOSC6, and Cdk2 peptides by circulating CD8+ cells was demonstrated by tetramer staining and IFN-gamma ELISPOT. The identification and characterization of peptides unique to the class I of breast cancer cells provide putative targets for the development of immune diagnostic tools and therapeutics.

Milk fat globule epidermal growth factor (EGF)-factor VIII (MFG-E8) mediates the clearance of apoptotic cells. We have previously shown that the administration of MFG-E8-rich exosomes from immature dendritic cells promotes the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and improves survival in sepsis. Because endotoxin is elevated in polymicrobial sepsis, we hypothesized that down-regulation of MFG-E8 is mediated via the LPS-CD14 pathway, eventually leading to the accruement of apoptotic cells. Polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in CD14-deficient (CD14(-/-)), TLR4-mutated and wild-type (WT) mice. In addition, endotoxemia was elicited by i.p. injection of LPS. LPS was also neutralized by pretreating CLP-induced WT mice with polymyxin B. Splenic MFG-E8 expression, phagocytic activity, and apoptosis were assessed 5 and 20 h after CLP or 5 h after LPS administration. In septic WT mice, MFG-E8 mRNA and protein levels were suppressed by 49 and 33%, respectively. Endotoxemia reduced MFG-E8 mRNA expression in a dose dependent manner and the down-regulation of MFG-E8 mRNA expression in CLP-induced sepsis was attenuated by polymyxin B. This CLP-induced suppression was not observed in both CD14(-/-) and TLR4-mutated mice. CLP significantly decreased phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages in WT (by 30%), but not in CD14(-/-) mice. CLP also induced significant apoptosis in the spleen of WT (by 61%), but less in CD14(-/-) mice. Thus, MFG-E8 production is down-regulated in sepsis by LPS-CD14 dependent fashion, leading to a reduction of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.	PMC2788770

Profile of exosomes related proteins released by differentiated and undifferentiated human keratinocytes.	J Cell Physiol	2009	Our group has previously demonstrated the capacity of human keratinocytes to release 14-3-3sigma into conditioned medium through the mechanism of exosome externalization. In this study the release of other proteins through the same mechanism and the differences in the profiles of 14-3-3 proteins between differentiated (diff-K) and undifferentiated keratinocytes (undiff-K) were investigated. The stimulatory effect of other 14-3-3 isoforms on the expression of MMP-1 in dermal fibroblasts was also evaluated. Exosomes isolated from undiff-K (low Ca(2+)) and diff-K (high Ca(2+)) were subjected to proteomic and Western blot analysis. The results showed that more than 50 different cytoplasmic proteins including all seven 14-3-3 protein isoforms (beta, sigma, eta, epsilon, tau, zeta, and gamma) were released from diff-K through the mechanism of exosome externalization. However, in exosomes of undiff-K only four of the 14-3-3 protein isoforms (beta, eta, zeta, and gamma) were detected. Ca(2+) treatment increased the release of exosomes from undiff-K by at least two times relative to the control. Consistent with this finding, the stimulatory effect of exosomes containing 14-3-3sigma from diff-K had higher MMP-1 stimulatory effect in fibroblasts relative to those exosomes isolated from undiff-K. MMP-1 stimulatory effect of recombinant 14-3-3beta and eta, tested in this study, in dermal fibroblasts, suggests additional anti-fibrogenic factors other than 14-3-3sigma. In conclusion, keratinocytes release many proteins through the mechanism of exosome externalization from which some such as 14-3-3 isoforms may function as extracellular matrix (ECM) modulating factors for dermal fibroblasts. These findings revealed the presence of a novel mechanism by which keratinocytes can potentially interact with fibroblasts.

AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses	2010	The HIV-1 Nef protein is known to be secreted, and our group has shown that Nef is secreted from nef-transfected and HIV-1-infected cells in small exosome-like vesicles (d. 40-100 nm). The role of secreted Nef remains to be fully characterized. Thus, it is important to characterize the nature of and the mechanisms regulating Nef secretion. We hypothesized that specific structural domains on the Nef protein interact with components of the endosomal trafficking machinery, sorting Nef into multivesicular bodies (MVB) and packaging it in exosome-like vesicles. To identify those domains, a series of mutants spanning the entire nef sequence were made and cloned into the expression vector pQB1, which expresses the mutants as Nef-GFP fusion proteins. These constructs were used in transient transfection assays to identify sequences necessary for secretion of the Nef-GFP fusion protein. N-terminal domains were identified as critical for Nef-induced vesicle secretion: (1) a basic cluster of four arginine residues (aa 17, 19, 21, 22), (2) the phosphofurin acidic cluster sequence (PACS; Glu62-65), and (3) a previously uncharacterized domain spanning amino acid residues 66-70 (VGFPV), which we named the secretion modification region (SMR). Additional amino acids P25, 29GVG31, and T44 were identified in HIV-1 Nef as regulating its secretion. These residues have not been associated with other reported Nef functions. The myristoylation domain, ubiquitination lysine residues, and the C-terminal portion of Nef (aa 71-206) had no effect on secretion. A minimal HIV-1 Nef sequence, comprising the identified motifs, was sufficient for Nef-induced vesicle secretion.	PMC2835390

Comparison of three methods for isolation of urinary microvesicles to identify biomarkers of nephrotic syndrome.	Kidney Int	2010	Urinary microvesicles, such as 40-100 nm exosomes and 100-1000 nm microparticles, contain many proteins that may serve as biomarkers of renal disease. Microvesicles have been isolated by ultracentrifugation or nanomembrane ultrafiltration from normal urine; however, little is known about the efficiency of these methods in isolating microvesicles from patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria. Here we compared three techniques to isolate microvesicles from nephrotic urine: nanomembrane ultrafiltration, ultracentrifugation, and ultracentrifugation followed by size-exclusion chromatography (UC-SEC). Highly abundant urinary proteins were still present in sufficient quantity after ultrafiltration or ultracentrifugation to blunt detection of less abundant microvesicular proteins by MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry. The microvesicular markers neprilysin, aquaporin-2, and podocalyxin were highly enriched following UC-SEC compared with preparations by ultrafiltration or ultracentrifugation alone. Electron microscopy of the UC-SEC fractions found microvesicles of varying size, compatible with the presence of both exosomes and microparticles. Thus, UC-SEC following ultracentrifugation to further enrich and purify microparticles facilitates the search for prognostic biomarkers that might be used to predict the clinical course of nephrotic syndrome.

Nuclear mRNA quality control in yeast is mediated by Nrd1 co-transcriptional recruitment, as revealed by the targeting of Rho-induced aberrant transcripts.	Nucleic Acids Res	2011	The production of mature export-competent transcripts is under the surveillance of quality control steps where aberrant mRNP molecules resulting from inappropriate or inefficient processing and packaging reactions are subject to exosome-mediated degradation. Previously, we have shown that the heterologous expression of bacterial Rho factor in yeast interferes in normal mRNP biogenesis leading to the production of full-length yet aberrant transcripts that are degraded by the nuclear exosome with ensuing growth defect. Here, we took advantage of this new tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which an integrated system recognizes aberrancies at each step of mRNP biogenesis and targets the defective molecules for destruction. We show that the targeting and degradation of Rho-induced aberrant transcripts is associated with a large increase of Nrd1 recruitment to the transcription complex via its CID and RRM domains and a concomitant enrichment of exosome component Rrp6 association. The targeting and degradation of the aberrant transcripts is suppressed by the overproduction of Pcf11 or its isolated CID domain, through a competition with Nrd1 for recruitment by the transcription complex. Altogether, our results support a model in which a stimulation of Nrd1 co-transcriptional recruitment coordinates the recognition and removal of aberrant transcripts by promoting the attachment of the nuclear mRNA degradation machinery.

Exosomes released from M. tuberculosis infected cells can suppress IFN-γ mediated activation of naïve macrophages.	PLoS One	2011	BACKGROUND: Macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) are known to be refractory to IFN-γ stimulation. Previous studies have shown that M.tb express components such as the 19-kDa lipoprotein and peptidoglycan that can bind to macrophage receptors including the Toll-like receptor 2 resulting in the loss in IFN-γ responsiveness. However, it is unclear whether this effect is limited to infected macrophages. We have previously shown that M.tb-infected macrophages release exosomes which are 30-100 nm membrane bound vesicles of endosomal origin that function in intercellular communication. These exosomes contain mycobacterial components including the 19-kDa lipoprotein and therefore we hypothesized that macrophages exposed to exosomes may show limited response to IFN-γ stimulation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Exosomes were isolated from resting as well as M.tb-infected RAW264.7 macrophages. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMØ) were treated with exosomes +/- IFN-γ. Cells were harvested and analyzed for suppression of IFN-γ responsive genes by flow cytometry and real time PCR. We found that exosomes derived from M.tb H37Rv-infected but not from uninfected macrophages inhibited IFN-γ induced MHC class II and CD64 expression on BMMØ. This inhibition was only partially dependent on the presence of lipoproteins but completely dependent on TLR2 and MyD88. The exosomes isolated from infected cells did not inhibit STAT1 Tyrosine phosphorylation but down-regulated IFN-γ induced expression of the class II major histocompatibility complex transactivator; a key regulator of class II MHC expression. Microarray studies showed that subsets of genes induced by IFN-γ were inhibited by exosomes from H37Rv-infected cells including genes involved in antigen presentation. Moreover, this set of genes partially overlapped with the IFN-γ-induced genes inhibited by H37Rv infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that exosomes, as carriers of M.tb pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), may provide a mechanism by which M.tb may exert its suppression of a host immune response beyond the infected cell.

Proteomics	2011	Distinct types of vesicles are formed in eukaryotic cells that conduct a variable set of functions depending on their origin. One subtype designated circulating microvesicles (MVs) provides a novel form of intercellular communication and recent work suggested the release and uptake of morphogens in vesicles by Drosophila cells. In this study, we have examined cells of the hemocyte-like cell lines Kc167 and S2 and identified secreted vesicles in the culture supernatant. The vesicles were isolated and found to have characteristics comparable to exosomes and plasma membrane MVs released by mammalian cells. In wingless-transfected cells, the full-length protein was detected in the vesicle isolates. Proteomics analyses of the vesicles identified 269 proteins that include various orthologs of marker proteins and proteins with putative functions in vesicle formation and release. Analogous to their mammalian counterparts, the subcellular origin of the vesicular constituents of both cell lines is dominated by membrane-associated and cytosolic proteins with functions that are consistent with their localization in MVs. The analyses revealed a significant overlap of the Kc167 and S2 vesicle proteomes and confirmed a close correlation with non-mammalian and mammalian exosomes.	
22313335	T Schaefer	Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research (NIBR), Basel, Switzerland. 	tamas.schweighoffer@novartis.com		Luminal decoration of blood vessels by activated perivasal mast cells in allergic rhinitis.	Allergy	2012	BACKGROUND: In allergic diseases, like in rhinitis, antigen challenge induces rapid degranulation of tissue resident mast cells and subsequent recruitment of leukocytes in response to soluble immunmodulators. The fate of mast cell-derived, membrane associated factors in inflamed tissue remained however unresolved. METHODS: Components of the mast cell granular membrane, including the unique marker CD63var, were examined by FACS and by confocal laser scanning microscopy in cell culture and in diseased human tissue. RESULTS: We discovered that selected mast cell membrane components appeared on the surface of distinct bystander cells. Acceptor cells did not acquire these molecules simply by uptake of soluble material or in the form of exosomes. Instead, physically stable cell-to-cell contact was required for transfer, in which a Notch2-Jagged1 interaction played a decisive role. This process is activation-dependent, unidirectional, and involves a unique membrane topology. Endothelial cells were particularly efficient acceptors. In organotypic 3D in vitro cultures we found that transferred mast cell molecules traversed an endothelial monolayer, and reappeared focally compacted on its distal surface, away from the actual contact zone. Moreover, we observed that such mast cell-derived membrane patches decorate microcapillaries in the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis patients. CONCLUSION: Direct membrane transfer from perivasal mast cells into nearby blood vessels constitutes a novel mechanism to modulate endothelial surface features with apparent significance in allergic diseases.

Cancer Microenviron	2012	Cancer is a complex organ whose behavior is not only influenced by genetic and epigenetic changes in cancer cells but also by stromal cells, local extracellular matrix and specific tissue architecture. Intercellular communications within the cancer microenvironment are critical to coordinate the assembly of multiple cell types for an amalgamated form and function of a cancer. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles with an endosome origin that are released by cells into the extracellular environment. They carry a cargo of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids and transfer their cargo to recipient cells and altering the recipient cells' biochemical composition, signaling pathways, and gene regulation. Exosomes can thus serve as extracellular messengers mediating cell-cell communication. Both cancer cells and stromal cells release exosomes not only into the cancer microenvironment but also into the circulation. In this review, we summarize the research done so far on cancer-derived exosomes and assess their roles as extracellular messengers facilitating cancer progression and metastasis.	PMC3460057

Oncol Rep	2012	Exosomes are microvesicles that are released from various cells into the extracellular space. It has been reported that the components within exosomes vary according to the type of secreted cell. In the present study, we investigated the tetraspanin family proteins CD63, CD9 and CD81 as useful collection markers of exosomes derived from the three colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines HCT-15, SW480 and WiDr. In addition, we aimed to detect the mRNAs, microRNAs and natural antisense RNAs within the exosomes secreted from the three CRC cell lines. Furthermore, we examined whether exosomes containing their RNAs were transferred into the hepatoma cell line HepG2 and lung cancer cell line A549. CD81 was detected in exosomes secreted from the three CRC cell lines. This result indicates that CD81 can be a collection marker of exosomes derived from the three CRC cell lines. When the RNA species within exosomes derived from the three CRC cell lines were examined, the mRNAs of housekeeping genes such as ACTB and GAPDH, the microRNAs such as miR-21, miR-192 and miR-221, and the natural antisense RNAs of LRRC24, MDM2 and CDKN1A genes, were detected. We discovered their natural antisense RNAs within exosomes for the first time in the present study. Furthermore, PKH67-labeled exosomes derived from the CRC cell lines were taken up into HepG2 and A549 cells. These findings indicate that the intracellular RNAs enclosed within exosomes are secreted to the outside, and exosomes derived from the CRC cell lines are transferred into HepG2 and A549 cells. In conclusion, we reveal that exosomes derived from the CRC cell lines contain mRNAs, microRNAs and natural antisense RNAs, and can be delivered into HepG2 and A549 cells. These findings indicate that exosomal RNAs can shuttle between cells, and may be involved in the regulation of gene expression in recipient cells.	PMC3583404

RRP41L, a putative core subunit of the exosome, plays an important role in seed germination and early seedling growth in Arabidopsis.	Plant Physiol	2013	In prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the 3'-5'-exonucleolytic decay and processing of RNAs are essential for RNA metabolism. However, the understanding of the mechanism of 3'-5'-exonucleolytic decay in plants is very limited. Here, we report the characterization of an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transfer DNA insertional mutant that shows severe growth defects in early seedling growth, including delayed germination and cotyledon expansion, thinner yellow/pale-green leaves, and a slower growth rate. High-efficiency thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the insertional locus was in the sixth exon of AT4G27490, encoding a predicted 3'-5'-exonuclease, that contained a conserved RNase phosphorolytic domain with high similarity to RRP41, designated RRP41L. Interestingly, we detected highly accumulated messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that encode seed storage protein and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and signaling pathway-related protein during the early growth stage in rrp41l mutants. The mRNA decay kinetics analysis for seed storage proteins, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases, and ABA INSENSITIVEs revealed that RRP41L catalyzed the decay of these mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Consistent with these results, the rrp41l mutant was more sensitive to ABA in germination and root growth than wild-type plants, whereas overexpression lines of RRP41L were more resistant to ABA in germination and root growth than wild-type plants. RRP41L was localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and RRP41L was preferentially expressed in seedlings. Altogether, our results showed that RRP41L plays an important role in seed germination and early seedling growth by mediating specific cytoplasmic mRNA decay in Arabidopsis.	PMC3532249

J Biol Chem	2013	Emerging evidence indicates that exosomes play a key role in tumor-host cross-talk and that exosome secretion, composition, and functional capacity are altered as tumors progress to an aggressive phenotype. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate these changes. Heparanase is an enzyme whose expression is up-regulated as tumors become more aggressive and is associated with enhanced tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. We have discovered that in human cancer cells (myeloma, lymphoblastoid, and breast cancer), when expression of heparanase is enhanced or when tumor cells are exposed to exogenous heparanase, exosome secretion is dramatically increased. Heparanase enzyme activity is required for robust enhancement of exosome secretion because enzymatically inactive forms of heparanase, even when present in high amounts, do not dramatically increase exosome secretion. Heparanase also impacts exosome protein cargo as reflected by higher levels of syndecan-1, VEGF, and hepatocyte growth factor in exosomes secreted by heparanase-high expressing cells as compared with heparanase-low expressing cells. In functional assays, exosomes from heparanase-high cells stimulated spreading of tumor cells on fibronectin and invasion of endothelial cells through extracellular matrix better than did exosomes secreted by heparanase-low cells. These studies reveal that heparanase helps drive exosome secretion, alters exosome composition, and facilitates production of exosomes that impact both tumor and host cell behavior, thereby promoting tumor progression.

Specific transfection of inflamed brain by macrophages: a new therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.	PLoS One	2013	The ability to precisely upregulate genes in inflamed brain holds great therapeutic promise. Here we report a novel class of vectors, genetically modified macrophages that carry reporter and therapeutic genes to neural cells. Systemic administration of macrophages transfected ex vivo with a plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding a potent antioxidant enzyme, catalase, produced month-long expression levels of catalase in the brain resulting in three-fold reductions in inflammation and complete neuroprotection in mouse models of Parkinson's disease (PD). This resulted in significant improvements in motor functions in PD mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that transfected macrophages secreted extracellular vesicles, exosomes, packed with catalase genetic material, pDNA and mRNA, active catalase, and NF-κb, a transcription factor involved in the encoded gene expression. Exosomes efficiently transfer their contents to contiguous neurons resulting in de novo protein synthesis in target cells. Thus, genetically modified macrophages serve as a highly efficient system for reproduction, packaging, and targeted gene and drug delivery to treat inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders.

CD9-positive microvesicles mediate the transfer of molecules to Bovine Spermatozoa during epididymal maturation.	PLoS One	2013	Acquisition of fertilization ability by spermatozoa during epididymal transit occurs in part by the transfer of molecules from membranous vesicles called epididymosomes. Epididymosomes are heterogeneous in terms of both size and molecular composition. Exosomes and other related small membranous vesicles (30-120 nm) containing tetraspanin proteins on their surface are found in many biological fluids. In this study, we demonstrate that these vesicles are present in bovine cauda epididymal fluid as a subpopulation of epididymosomes. They contain tetraspanin CD9 in addition to other proteins involved in sperm maturation such as P25b, GliPr1L1, and MIF. In order to study the mechanism of protein transfer to sperm, DilC12-labeled unfractionated epididymosomes or CD9-positive microvesicles were coincubated with epididymal spermatozoa, and their transfer was evaluated by flow cytometry. CD9-positive microvesicles from epididymal fluid specifically transferred molecules to spermatozoa, whereas those prepared from blood were unable to do so. The CD9-positive microvesicles transferred molecules to the same sperm regions (acrosome and midpiece) as epididymosomes, with the same kinetics; however, the molecules were preferentially transferred to live sperm and, in contrast to epididymosomes, Zn(2+) did not demonstrate potentiated transfer. Tetraspanin CD9 was associated with other proteins on the membrane surface of CD9-positive microvesicles according to coimmunoprecipitation experiments. CD26 cooperated with CD9 in the molecular transfer to sperm since the amount of molecules transferred was significantly reduced in the presence of specific antibodies. In conclusion, CD9-positive microvesicles are present in bovine cauda epididymal fluid and transfer molecules to live maturing sperm in a tissue-specific manner that involves CD9 and CD26.	PMC3681974

Intercellular transfer of tissue factor via the uptake of tumor-derived microvesicles.	Thromb Res	2013	Coagulation proteins play a critical role in numerous aspects of tumor biology. Cancer cells express tissue factor (TF), the protein that initiates blood clotting, which frequently correlates with processes related to cell aggressiveness, including primary tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. It has been demonstrated that TF gets incorporated into tumor-derived microvesicles (MVs), a process that has been correlated with cancer-associated thrombosis. Here, we describe the exchange of TF-bearing MVs between breast cancer cell lines with different aggressiveness potential. The highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells displayed higher surface levels of functional TF compared with the less aggressive MCF-7 cells. MVs derived from MDA-MB-231 cells were enriched in TF and accelerated plasma coagulation, but MCF-7 cell-derived MVs expressed very low levels of TF. Incubating MCF-7 cells with MDA-MB-231 MVs significantly increased the TF activity. This phenomenon was not observed upon pretreatment of MVs with anti-TF or annexin-V, which blocks phosphatidylserine sites on the surface of MVs. Our data indicated that TF-bearing MVs can be transferred between different populations of cancer cells and may therefore contribute to the propagation of a TF-related aggressive phenotype among heterogeneous subsets of cells in a tumor.

Exosomes derived from hypoxic leukemia cells enhance tube formation in endothelial cells.	J Biol Chem	2013	Hypoxia plays an important role during the evolution of cancer cells and their microenvironment. Emerging evidence suggests communication between cancer cells and their microenvironment occurs via exosomes. This study aimed to clarify whether hypoxia affects angiogenic function through exosomes secreted from leukemia cells. We used the human leukemia cell line K562 for exosome-generating cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) for exosome target cells. Exosomes derived from K562 cells cultured under normoxic (20%) or hypoxic (1%) conditions for 24 h were isolated and quantitated by nanoparticle tracking analysis. These exosomes were then cocultured with HUVECs to evaluate angiogenic activity. The exosomes secreted from K562 cells in hypoxic conditions significantly enhanced tube formation by HUVECs compared with exosomes produced in normoxic conditions. Using a TaqMan low-density miRNA array, we found a subset of miRNAs, including miR-210, were significantly increased in exosomes secreted from hypoxic K562 cells. We demonstrated that cancer cells and their exosomes have altered miRNA profiles under hypoxic conditions. Although exosomes contain various molecular constituents such as proteins and mRNAs, altered exosomal compartments under hypoxic conditions, including miR-210, affected the behavior of endothelial cells. Our results suggest that exosomal miRNA derived from cancer cells under hypoxic conditions may partly affect angiogenic activity in endothelial cells.	PMC3843049

Characterization of RNA in exosomes secreted by human breast cancer cell lines using next-generation sequencing.	PeerJ	2013	Exosomes are nanosized (30-100 nm) membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types. Exosomes have been found to contain various RNA species including miRNA, mRNA and long non-protein coding RNAs. A number of cancer cells produce elevated levels of exosomes. Because exosomes have been isolated from most body fluids they may provide a source for non-invasive cancer diagnostics. Transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies (RNA-Seq) offers enormous amount of data that can be used for biomarkers discovery, however, in case of exosomes this approach was applied only for the analysis of small RNAs. In this study, we utilized RNA-Seq technology to analyze RNAs present in microvesicles secreted by human breast cancer cell lines. Exosomes were isolated from the media conditioned by two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436. Exosomal RNA was profiled using the Ion Torrent semiconductor chip-based technology. Exosomes were found to contain various classes of RNA with the major class represented by fragmented ribosomal RNA (rRNA), in particular 28S and 18S rRNA subunits. Analysis of exosomal RNA content revealed that it reflects RNA content of the donor cells. Although exosomes produced by the two cancer cell lines shared most of the RNA species, there was a number of non-coding transcripts unique to MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells. This suggests that RNA analysis might distinguish exosomes produced by low metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-436) from that produced by highly metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). The analysis of gene ontologies (GOs) associated with the most abundant transcripts present in exosomes revealed significant enrichment in genes encoding proteins involved in translation and rRNA and ncRNA processing. These GO terms indicate most expressed genes for both, cellular and exosomal RNA. For the first time, using RNA-seq, we examined the transcriptomes of exosomes secreted by human breast cancer cells. We found that most abundant exosomal RNA species are the fragments of 28S and 18S rRNA subunits. This limits the number of reads from other RNAs. To increase the number of detectable transcripts and improve the accuracy of their expression level the protocols allowing depletion of fragmented rRNA should be utilized in the future RNA-seq analyses on exosomes. Present data revealed that exosomal transcripts are representative of their cells of origin and thus could form basis for detection of tumor specific markers.	PMC3828613

Differences in exosome populations in human breast milk in relation to allergic sensitization and lifestyle.	Allergy	2014	BACKGROUND: Breast-feeding has many beneficial effects on the developing immune system of the newborn. Breast milk contains immunoregulatory factors, such as nano-sized vesicles named exosomes. This study aimed at characterizing breast milk exosomes from human early milk and mature milk and to investigate whether allergic sensitization and an anthroposophic lifestyle could influence the exosome profile. METHODS: Breast milk was collected from 22 mothers at day 3-8 and from 61 mothers at 2 months postpartum, all part of the ALADDIN birth cohort. Isolated exosomes were captured on anti-MHC-class II- or anti-CD63 beads and analyzed by flow cytometry. Exosomal phenotype was related to lifestyle and allergic sensitization of the mothers, and sensitization of the child at 2 years of age. RESULTS: We found a higher content of exosomes in early milk compared with mature milk. Early milk exosomes were enriched in HLA-DR molecules and displayed significantly lower levels of HLA-ABC compared with those in mature milk. Phenotypically different subpopulations of exosomes were found in mature milk. Significantly lower levels of MUC1 were detected on CD63-enriched exosomes from sensitized mothers compared with nonsensitized. Furthermore, women with an anthroposophic lifestyle had significantly lower MUC1 expression on their HLA-DR-enriched milk exosomes and up-regulated levels of CD63 on CD63-enriched exosomes compared with nonanthroposophic mothers. Notably, mothers whose children developed sensitization had an increased amount of HLA-ABC on their milk exosomes enriched for CD63. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype of exosomes in breast milk varies with maternal sensitization and lifestyle, which might influence allergy development in the child.

Embryonic cerebrospinal fluid nanovesicles carry evolutionarily conserved molecules and promote neural stem cell amplification.	PLoS One	2014	During brain development, neural stem cells (NSCs) receive on-or-off signals important for regulating their amplification and reaching adequate neuron density. However, how a coordinated regulation of intracellular pathways and genetic programs is achieved has remained elusive. Here, we found that the embryonic (e) CSF contains 10¹² nanoparticles/ml (77 nm diameter), some of which were identified as exosome nanovesicles that contain evolutionarily conserved molecules important for coordinating intracellular pathways. eCSF nanovesicles collected from rodent and human embryos encapsulate protein and microRNA components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway. Supplementation of eCSF nanovesicles to a mixed culture containing eNSCs activated the IGF-mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway in eNSCs and expanded the pool of proliferative eNSCs.

Human B Cell-Derived Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines Constitutively Produce Fas Ligand and Secrete MHCII(+)FasL(+) Killer Exosomes.	Front Immunol	2014	Immune suppression mediated by exosomes is an emerging concept with potentially immense utility for immunotherapy in a variety of inflammatory contexts, including allogeneic transplantation. Exosomes containing the apoptosis-inducing molecule Fas ligand (FasL) have demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting antigen-specific immune responses upon adoptive transfer in animal models. We report here that a very high frequency of human B cell-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) constitutively produce MHCII(+)FasL(+) exosomes that can induce apoptosis in CD4(+) T cells. All LCL tested for this study (>20 independent cell lines) showed robust expression of FasL, but had no detectable FasL on the cell surface. Given this intracellular sequestration, we hypothesized that FasL in LCL was retained in the secretory lysosome and secreted via exosomes. Indeed, we found both MHCII and FasL proteins present in LCL-derived exosomes, and using a bead-based exosome capture assay demonstrated the presence of MHCII(+)FasL(+) exosomes among those secreted by LCL. Using two independent experimental approaches, we demonstrated that LCL-derived exosomes were capable of inducing antigen-specific apoptosis in autologous CD4(+) T cells. These results suggest that LCL-derived exosomes may present a realistic source of immunosuppressive exosomes that could reduce or eliminate T cell-mediated responses against donor-derived antigens in transplant recipients.

Reprod Biol Endocrinol	2014	BACKGROUND: Ovarian follicle growth and maturation requires extensive communication between follicular somatic cells and oocytes. Recently, intercellular cell communication was described involving cell-secreted vesicles called exosomes (50-150 nm), which contain miRNAs and protein, and have been identified in ovarian follicular fluid. The goal of this study was to identify a possible role of exosomes in follicle maturation. METHODS: Follicle contents were collected from mares at mid-estrous (~35 mm, before induction of follicular maturation) and pre-ovulatory follicles (30-34 h after induction of follicular maturation). A real time PCR screen was conducted to reveal significant differences in the presence of exosomal miRNAs isolated from mid-estrous and pre-ovulatory follicles, and according to bioinformatics analysis these exosomal miRNAs are predicted to target members belonging to the TGFB superfamily, including ACVR1 and ID2. Granulosa cells from pre-ovulatory follicles were cultured and treated with exosomes isolated from follicular fluid. Changes in mRNA and protein were measured by real time PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: ACVR1 mRNA and protein was detected in granulosa cells at mid-estrous and pre-ovulatory stages, and real time PCR analysis revealed significantly lower levels of ID2 (an ACVR1 target gene) in granulosa cells from pre-ovulatory follicles. Exposure to exosomes from follicular fluid of mid-estrous follicles decreased ID2 levels in granulosa cells. Moreover, exosomes isolated from mid-estrous and pre-ovulatory follicles contain ACVR1 and miR-27b, miR-372, and miR-382 (predicted regulators of ACVR1 and ID2) were capable of altering ID2 levels in pre-ovulatory granulosa cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that exosomes isolated from follicular fluid can regulate members of the TGFB/BMP signaling pathway in granulosa cells, and possibly play a role in regulating follicle maturation.

Tumour Biol	2014	Breast cancer (BCa) remains chemo-unresponsive by inevitable progression of resistance to first-line treatment with docetaxel (doc). Emerging studies indicate that exosomes act as mediators of intercellular communication between heterogeneous populations of tumor cells, engendering a transmitted drug resistance for cancer development. Such modulatory effects have been related to the constant shuttle of biologically active molecules including microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we aimed to investigate the relevance of exosome-mediated miRNA delivery in resistance transmission of BCa subpopulations. Using microarray and polymerase chain reaction, we found that exosomes from doc-resistant BCa cells (D/exo) loaded cellular miRNAs. Following D/exo transfer to the fluorescent sensitive cells (GFP-S), some miRNAs were significantly increased in recipient GFP-S. Target gene prediction and pathway analysis revealed the involvement of the top 20 most abundant miRNAs of D/exo in pathways implicated in therapy failure. Coculture assays showed that miRNA-containing D/exo increased the overall resistance of GFP-S to doc exposure. Moreover, D/exo was able to alter gene expression in GFP-S. Our results open up an intriguing possibility that drug-resistant BCa cells may spread chemoresistance to sensitive ones by releasing exosomes and that the effects could be partly attributed to the intercellular transfer of specific miRNAs.

Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis peptides in the exosomes of patients with active and latent M. tuberculosis infection using MRM-MS.	PLoS One	2014	The identification of easily measured, accurate diagnostic biomarkers for active tuberculosis (TB) will have a significant impact on global TB control efforts. Because of the host and pathogen complexities involved in TB pathogenesis, identifying a single biomarker that is adequately sensitive and specific continues to be a major hurdle. Our previous studies in models of TB demonstrated that exosomes, such as those released from infected macrophages, contain mycobacterial products, including many Mtb proteins. In this report, we describe the development of targeted proteomics assays employing multiplexed multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) in order to allow us to follow those proteins previously identified by western blot or shotgun mass spectrometry, and enhance biomarker discovery to include detection of Mtb proteins in human serum exosomes. Targeted MRM-MS assays were applied to exosomes isolated from human serum samples obtained from culture-confirmed active TB patients to detect 76 peptides representing 33 unique Mtb proteins. Our studies revealed the first identification of bacteria-derived biomarker candidates of active TB in exosomes from human serum. Twenty of the 33 proteins targeted for detection were found in the exosomes of TB patients, and included multiple peptides from 8 proteins (Antigen 85B, Antigen 85C, Apa, BfrB, GlcB, HspX, KatG, and Mpt64). Interestingly, all of these proteins are known mycobacterial adhesins and/or proteins that contribute to the intracellular survival of Mtb. These proteins will be included as target analytes in future validation studies as they may serve as markers for persistent active and latent Mtb infection. In summary, this work is the first step in identifying a unique and specific panel of Mtb peptide biomarkers encapsulated in exosomes and reveals complex biomarker patterns across a spectrum of TB disease states.

Isolation of urinary extracellular vesicles from Tamm- Horsfall protein-depleted urine and their application in the development of a lectin-exosome-binding assay.	Biotechniques	2014	Urine is a readily available source of relatively large quantities of extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, the isolation of urinary EVs (uEVs) is complicated by the presence of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), which polymerizes and co-precipitates as a contaminant. This may make glycan analysis of uEVs difficult since THP is heavily glycosylated. To facilitate glycosylation analysis and address the need for elimination of non-uEV glycans, we present a modification of the uEV isolation procedure and use the isolated uEVs in the development of a lectin-exosome binding assay. Salt precipitation was employed to remove THP under conditions originally described for its separation from urine, followed by differential centrifugation. The quality of the isolated uEVs was examined by electron microscopy, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting. The uEVs were subsequently immobilized on solid phase and probed with labeled plant lectins using the lectin-exosome binding assay. Our results indicate that the isolated uEVs had preserved structural integrity and reacted with labeled plant lectins in a selective, carbohydrate-dependent manner. The basic lectin binding pattern of uEVs obtained by our method can be used as a reference for assessing the composition of their surface glycans in different physiological and pathological conditions.

Increased serum levels of circulating exosomal microRNA-373 in receptor-negative breast cancer patients.	Oncotarget	2014	In this study, we compared the blood serum levels of circulating cell-free and exosomal microRNAs, and their involvement in the molecular subtypes of breast cancer patients. Our analyses on cell-free miR-101, miR-372 and miR-373 were performed in preoperative blood serum of 168 patients with invasive breast cancer, 19 patients with benign breast diseases and 28 healthy women. MicroRNAs were additionally quantified in exosomes of 50 cancer patients and 12 healthy women from the same cohort. Relative concentrations were measured by quantitative TaqMan MicroRNA assays and correlated to clinicopathological risk factors. The concentrations of cell-free miR-101 (p=0.013) and miR-373 (p=0.024) were significantly different between patients with breast cancer and benign tumors. A prevalence of miR-101, miR-372 and miR-373 were found in exosomes. The levels of circulating exosomal (but not cell-free) miR-373 were higher in triple negative than luminal carcinomas (p=0.027). Also, estrogen-negative (p=0.021) and progesterone-negative (p=0.01) tumors displayed higher concentrations of exosomal miR-373 than patients with hormone-receptor positive tumors. Overexpression of miR-373 by transfection of MCF-7 cells showed downregulated protein expression of the estrogen receptor, and inhibition of apoptosis induced by camptothecin. Our data indicate that serum levels of exosomal miR-373 are linked to triple negative and more aggressive breast carcinomas.	PMC4259427

Oncotarget	2015	In colorectal cancer (CoCa) EpCAM is frequently associated with claudin-7. There is evidence that tumor-promoting EpCAM activities are modulated by the association with claudin-7. To support this hypothesis, claudin-7 was knocked-down (kd) in HT29 and SW948 cells. HT29-cld7kd and SW948-cld7kd cells display decreased anchorage-independent growth and the capacity for holoclone-, respectively, sphere-formation is reduced. Tumor growth is delayed and cld7kd cells poorly metastasize. In line with this, migratory and invasive potential of cld7kd clones is strongly impaired, migration being inhibited by anti-CD49c, but not anti-EpCAM, although motility is reduced in EpCAM siRNA-treated cells. This is due to claudin-7 recruiting EpCAM in glycolipid-enriched membrane fractions towards claudin-7-associated TACE and presenilin2, which cleave EpCAM. The cleaved intracellular domain, EpIC, promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated transcription factor expression, which together with fibronectin and vimentin are reduced in claudin-7kd cells. But, uptake of HT29wt and SW948wt exosomes by the claudin-7kd lines sufficed for transcription factor upregulation and for restoring motility. Thus, claudin-7 contributes to motility and invasion and is required for recruiting EpCAM towards TACE/presenilin2. EpIC generation further supports motility by promoting a shift towards EMT. Notably, EMT features of cld7-competent metastatic CoCa cells can be transferred via exosomes to poorly metastatic cells.	PMC4385835

BMC Cancer	2015	BACKGROUND: Caveolin-1 (CAV1) may be upregulated by hypoxia and acts in a tumor-dependent manner. We investigated CAV1 in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) and its association with clinical outcomes, and studied in vitro possible ways for CAV1 accumulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). METHODS: TSCC cases (N = 64) were immunohistochemically stained for CAV1. Scores were separately assessed in the tumor and TME and plotted for association with recurrence and survival (univariate analysis with log-rank test). In vitro studies were performed on a 3D myoma organotypic model, a mimicker of TME. Prior to monoculturing HSC-3 tongue cancer cells, the model underwent modifications in oxygenation level (1%O2 hypoxia to upregulate CAV1) and/or in the amount of natural soluble factors [deleted by 14-day rinsing (rinsed myoma, RM), to allow only HSC-3-derived factors to act]. Controls included normoxia (21%O2) and naturally occurring soluble factors (intact myoma, IM). HSC-3 cells were also co-cultured with CaDEC12 cells (fibroblasts exposed to human tongue cancer). CAV1 expression and cellular distribution were examined in different cellular components in hypoxic and rinsed myoma assays. Twist served as a marker for the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Exosomes isolated from HSC-3 media were investigated for containing CAV1. RESULTS: Expression of CAV1 in TSCC had a higher score in TME than in the tumor cells and a negative impact on recurrence (p = 0.01) and survival (p = 0.003). Monocultures of HSC-3 revealed expression of CAV1 mainly in the TME-like myoma assay, similar to TSCC. CAV1+, alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) + and Twist + CAF-like cells were observed surrounding the invading HSC-3, possibly reflecting EMT. RM findings were similar to IM, inferring action of HSC-3 derived factors, and no differences were seen when hypoxia was induced. HSC-3-CaDEC12 co-cultures revealed CAV1+, αSMA+ and cytokeratin-negative CAF-like cells, raising the possibility of CaDEC12 cells gaining a CAF phenotype. HSC-3-derived exosomes were loaded with CAV1. CONCLUSIONS: Accumulation of CAV1-TME in TSCC had a negative prognostic value. In vitro studies showed the presence of CAV1 in cancer cells undergoing EMT and in fibroblasts undergoing trans-differentiation to CAFs. CAV1 delivery to the TME involved cancer cell-derived exosomes.	PMC4318139

Cardiosome mediated regulation of MMP9 in diabetic heart: role of mir29b and mir455 in exercise.	J Cell Mol Med	2015	'Cardiosomes' (exosomes from cardiomyocytes) have recently emerged as nanovesicles (30-100 nm) released in the cardiosphere by myocytes and cardiac progenitor cells, though their role in diabetes remains elusive. Diabetic cardiovascular complications are unequivocally benefitted from exercise; however, the molecular mechanisms need exploration. This novel study is based on our observation that exercise brings down the levels of activated (Matrix Metalloprotease 9) in db/db mice in a model of type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize that exosomes that are released during exercise contain microRNAs (mir455, mir29b, mir323-5p and mir466) that bind to the 3' region of MMP9 and downregulate its expression, hence mitigating the deleterious downstream effects of MMP9, which causes extracellular matrix remodeling. First, we confirmed the presence of exosomes in the heart tissue and serum by electron microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively, in the four treatment groups: (i) db/control, (ii) db/control+exercise, (iii) db/db and (iv) db/db+exercise. Use of exosomal markers CD81, Flottilin 1, and acetylcholinesterase activity in the isolated exosomes confirmed enhanced exosomal release in the exercise group. The microRNAs isolated from the exosomes contained mir455, mir29b, mir323-5p and mir466 as quantified by qRTPCR, however, mir29b and mir455 showed highest upregulation. We performed 2D zymography which revealed significantly lowered activity of MMP9 in the db/db exercise group as compared to non-exercise group. The immunohistochemical analysis further confirmed the downregulated expression of MMP9 after exercise. Since MMP9 is involved in matrix degradation and leads to fibrosis and myocyte uncoupling, the present study provides a strong evidence how exercise can mitigate these conditions in diabetic patients.

J Natl Cancer Inst	2015	BACKGROUND: How exosomic microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to the development of drug resistance in the context of the tumor microenvironment has not been previously described in neuroblastoma (NBL). METHODS: Coculture experiments were performed to assess exosomic transfer of miR-21 from NBL cells to human monocytes and miR-155 from human monocytes to NBL cells. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to assess miR-155 targeting of TERF1 in NBL cells. Tumor growth was measured in NBL xenografts treated with Cisplatin and peritumoral exosomic miR-155 (n = 6 mice per group) CD163, miR-155, and TERF1 levels were assessed in 20 NBL primary tissues by Human Exon Arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Student's t test was used to evaluate the differences between treatment groups. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: miR-21 mean fold change (f.c.) was 12.08±0.30 (P < .001) in human monocytes treated with NBL derived exosomes for 48 hours, and miR-155 mean f.c. was 4.51±0.25 (P < .001) in NBL cells cocultured with human monocytes for 48 hours. TERF1 mean luciferase activity in miR-155 transfected NBL cells normalized to scrambled was 0.36 ± 0.05 (P <.001). Mean tumor volumes in Dotap-miR-155 compared with Dotap-scrambled were 322.80±120mm(3) and 76.00±39.3mm(3), P = .002 at day 24, respectively. Patients with high CD163 infiltrating NBLs had statistically significantly higher intratumoral levels of miR-155 (P = .04) and lower levels of TERF1 mRNA (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a unique role of exosomic miR-21 and miR-155 in the cross-talk between NBL cells and human monocytes in the resistance to chemotherapy, through a novel exosomic miR-21/TLR8-NF-кB/exosomic miR-155/TERF1 signaling pathway.

J Membr Biol	2015	Prostasomes are vesicles secreted by prostate epithelial cells and are found in abundance in the semen. Here we characterized two different prostasome populations isolated from human seminal fluid. Prostasomes were isolated using differential centrifugation, while dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to characterize their size and size distribution. Their protein content was analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. DLS showed two distinct prostasome subpopulations in centrifuged seminal plasma, with an average hydrodynamic radius of 80 and 300 nm. The larger population was isolated after centrifugation at 20,000 × g (P20), while the smaller one was recovered at 100,000 × g (P100). The two fractions had a similar lipid composition, showing an elevated content of sphingomyelin and cholesterol. The P100 vesicles showed a significant over-expression of proteins involved in the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery such as Alix, TSG101, and syntenin-1. Some proteins possibly involved in prostate cancer were present only in one specific population (TMPRSS2 in P100 and VCP in P20). The different size and protein profile in the two subpopulations of prostasomes might support differential roles of the semen vesicles toward the target cells, and/or different secretion pathways from the organ of origin.

Effect of hyperthermic CO2-treated dendritic cell-derived exosomes on the human gastric cancer AGS cell line.	Oncol Lett	2015	The aim of the present study was to determine the antitumor effects of hyperthermic CO2 (HT-CO2)-treated dendritic cell (DC)-derived exosomes (Dex) on human gastric cancer AGS cells. Mouse-derived DCs were incubated in HT-CO2 at 43°C for 4 h. The exosomes in the cell culture supernatant were then isolated. Cell proliferation was analyzed using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis was observed using flow cytometry, Hoechst 33258 staining and the analysis of caspase-3 activity. In addition, the proliferation of tumor cells was evaluated in xenotransplant nude mice. HT-CO2 markedly inhibited cell proliferation, as assessed by the CCK-8 assay, and also induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner, as demonstrated by Annexin V/propidium iodide flow cytometry, caspase-3 activity and morphological analysis using Hoechst fluorescent dye. It was also revealed that HT-CO2-treated Dex decreased the expression of heat shock protein 70 and inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. In conclusion, HT-CO2 exerted an efficacious immune-enhancing effect on DCs. These findings may provide a novel strategy for the elimination of free cancer cells during laparoscopic resection. However, the potential cellular mechanisms underlying this process require further investigation.	PMC4486837

Cell Physiol Biochem	2015	BACKGROUND: Currently, exosomes that act as mediators of intercellular communication are being researched extensively. Our previous studies confirmed that these exosomes contain microRNAs (miRNAs) that could alter chemo-susceptibility, which is partly attributed to the successful intercellular transfer of multidrug resistance (MDR)-specific miRNAs. We also confirmed that β-elemene could influence MDR-related miRNA expression and regulate the expression of the target genes PTEN and Pgp, which may lead to the reversal of the chemoresistant breast cancer (BCA) cells. We are the first to report these findings, and we propose the following logical hypothesis: β-elemene can mediate MDR-related miRNA expression in cells, thereby affecting the exosome contents, reducing chemoresistance transmission via exosomes, and reversing the drug resistance of breast cancer cells. METHODS: MTT-cytotoxic, miRNA microarray, real-time quantitative PCR, Dual Luciferase Activity Assay, and Western blot analysis were performed to investigate the impact of β-elemene on the expression of chemoresistance specific miRNA and PTEN as well as Pgp in chemoresistant BCA exosomes. RESULTS: Drug resistance can be reversed by β-elemene related to exosomes. There were 104 differentially expressed miRNAs in the exosomes of two chemoresistant BCA cells: adriacin (Adr) - resistant MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/Adr) and docetaxel (Doc) - resistant MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/Doc) that underwent treatment. Of these, 31 miRNAs were correlated with the constant changes in the MDR. The expression of miR-34a and miR-452 can lead to changes in the characteristics of two chemoresistant BCA exosomes: MCF-7/Adr exosomes (A/exo) and MCF-7/Doc exosomes (D/exo). The PTEN expression affected by β-elemene was significantly increased, and the Pgp expression affected by β-elemene was significantly decreased in both cells and exosomes. β-elemene induced a significant increase in the apoptosis rate in both MCF-7/Doc and MCF-7/Adr cells. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance can be reversed by β-elemene, which can alter the expression of some MDR-related miRNAs, including PTEN and Pgp in MCF-7/Adr and MCF-7/Doc in cells. It can therefore affect the exosome contents and induce the reduction of resistance transmission via exosomes.

Biol Reprod	2015	Expansion of the cumulus complex surrounding the oocyte is critical for ovulation of a fertilizable egg. The ovulation-inducing surge of luteinizing hormone leads to an increased expression of genes such as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), pentraxin-related protein 3 (Ptx3), and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 6 (Tnfaip6) that support cumulus expansion. Factors released by mural granulosa and cumulus granulosa cells into the follicular fluid induce paracrine signaling within the follicular compartment. The follicular fluid that separates these distinct granulosa cell types is an enriched fluid containing numerous proteins, nucleic acids, and other macromolecules. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are also present; however, no physiologically relevant functions of follicular EVs have yet been demonstrated. In our study, the effect of follicular EVs on cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) expansion and relevant gene expression was assayed. Follicular EVs were isolated using ultracentrifugation from follicular fluid of small (3-5 mm) and large (>9 mm) antral bovine follicles, then characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, electron microscopy, and Western blot analysis. To test for bioactivity, mouse and bovine COCs were cultured with follicular EVs. Cumulus expansion and Ptgs2, Ptx3, and Tnfaip6 gene expression were measured following COC maturation culture. The results demonstrated that follicular EVs can support both measurable cumulus expansion and increased gene expression.	PMC4712005

Cell Physiol Biochem	2015	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) widely applied for treating myocardial infarction face survival challenges in the inflammatory and ischemia microenvironment of acute myocardial infarction. The study hypothesized that MSC-derived exosomes play a significant role in improving microenvironment after acute myocardial infarction and aimed to investigate the paracrine effects of exosomes on angiogenesis and anti-inflammatory activity. METHODS: MSCs were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% exosome-depleted fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 48 h. MSC-derived exosomes were isolated using ExoQuick-TC. Tube formation and T-cell proliferation assays were performed to assess the angiogenic potency of MSC-derived exosomes. Acute myocardial infarction was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats, and myocardium bordering the infarcted zone was injected at four different sites with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, control), MSC-derived exosomes, and exosome-depleted MSC culture medium. RESULTS: MSC-derived exosomes significantly enhanced the tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, impaired T-cell function by inhibiting cell proliferation in vitro, reduced infarct size, and preserved cardiac systolic and diastolic performance compared with PBS markedly enhancing the density of new functional capillary and hence blood flow recovery in rat myocardial infarction model. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes stimulate neovascularization and restrain the inflammation response, thus improving heart function after ischemic injury.

J Neuroinflammation	2016	BACKGROUND: Previously, we have demonstrated that spleen-derived dendritic cells (DCs) modified with atorvastatin suppressed immune responses of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG). However, the effects of exosomes derived from atorvastatin-modified bone marrow DCs (BMDCs) (statin-Dex) on EAMG are still unknown. METHODS: Immunophenotypical characterization of exosomes from atorvastatin- and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-modified BMDCs was performed by electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and western blotting. In order to investigate whether statin-DCs-derived exosomes (Dex) could induce immune tolerance in EAMG, we administrated statin-Dex, control-Dex, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into EAMG rats via tail vein injection. The tracking of injected Dex and the effect of statin-Dex injection on endogenous DCs were performed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, respectively. The number of Foxp3(+) cells in thymuses was examined using immunocytochemistry. Treg cells, cytokine secretion, lymphocyte proliferation, cell viability and apoptosis, and the levels of autoantibody were also carried out to evaluate the effect of statin-Dex on EAMG rats. To further investigate the involvement of FasL/Fas in statin-Dex-induced apoptosis, the underlying mechanisms were studied by FasL neutralization assays. RESULTS: Our data showed that the systemic injection of statin-Dex suppressed the clinical symptoms of EAMG rats. These statin-Dex had immune regulation functions in immune organs, such as the spleen, thymus, and popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, statin-Dex exerted their immunomodulatory effects in vivo by decreasing the expression of CD80, CD86, and MHC class II on endogenous DCs. Importantly, the therapeutic effects of statin-Dex on EAMG rats were associated with up-regulated levels of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)/Treg and partly dependent on FasL/Fas pathway, which finally resulted in decreased synthesis of anti-R97-116 IgG, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that atorvastatin-induced immature BMDCs are able to secrete tolerogenic Dex, which are involved in the suppression of immune responses in EAMG rats. Importantly, our study provides a novel cell-free approach for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.	PMC4710023

Application of a Persistent Heparin Treatment Inhibits the Malignant Potential of Oral Squamous Carcinoma Cells Induced by Tumor Cell-Derived Exosomes.	PLoS One	2016	Exosomes are 30-100 nm-sized membranous vesicles, secreted from a variety of cell types into their surrounding extracellular space. Various exosome components including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids are transferred to recipient cells and affect their function and activity. Numerous studies have showed that tumor cell-derived exosomes play important roles in tumor growth and progression. However, the effect of exosomes released from oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) into the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. In the present study, we isolated exosomes from OSCC cells and investigated the influence of OSCC cell-derived exosomes on the tumor cell behavior associated with tumor development. We demonstrated that OSCC cell-derived exosomes were taken up by OSCC cells themselves and significantly promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion through the activation of the PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and JNK-1/2 pathways in vitro. These effects of OSCC cell-derived exosomes were obviously attenuated by treatment with PI3K, ERK-1/2, and JNK-1/2 pharmacological inhibitors. Furthermore, the growth rate of tumor xenografts implanted into nude mice was promoted by treatment with OSCC cell-derived exosomes. The uptake of exosomes by OSCC cells and subsequent tumor progression was abrogated in the presence of heparin. Taken together, these data suggest that OSCC cell-derived exosomes might be a novel therapeutic target and the use of heparin to inhibit the uptake of OSCC-derived exosomes by OSCC cells may be useful for treatment.

Cells release subpopulations of exosomes with distinct molecular and biological properties.	Sci Rep	2016	Cells release nano-sized membrane vesicles that are involved in intercellular communication by transferring biological information between cells. It is generally accepted that cells release at least three types of extracellular vesicles (EVs): apoptotic bodies, microvesicles and exosomes. While a wide range of putative biological functions have been attributed to exosomes, they are assumed to represent a homogenous population of EVs. We hypothesized the existence of subpopulations of exosomes with defined molecular compositions and biological properties. Density gradient centrifugation of isolated exosomes revealed the presence of two distinct subpopulations, differing in biophysical properties and their proteomic and RNA repertoires. Interestingly, the subpopulations mediated differential effects on the gene expression programmes in recipient cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that cells release distinct exosome subpopulations with unique compositions that elicit differential effects on recipient cells. Further dissection of exosome heterogeneity will advance our understanding of exosomal biology in health and disease and accelerate the development of exosome-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

Exosomal transfer of stroma-derived miR21 confers paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cells through targeting APAF1.	Nat Commun	2016	Advanced ovarian cancer usually spreads to the visceral adipose tissue of the omentum. However, the omental stromal cell-derived molecular determinants that modulate ovarian cancer growth have not been characterized. Here, using next-generation sequencing technology, we identify significantly higher levels of microRNA-21 (miR21) isomiRNAs in exosomes and tissue lysates isolated from cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs) and fibroblasts (CAFs) than in those from ovarian cancer cells. Functional studies reveal that miR21 is transferred from CAAs or CAFs to the cancer cells, where it suppresses ovarian cancer apoptosis and confers chemoresistance by binding to its direct novel target, APAF1. These data suggest that the malignant phenotype of metastatic ovarian cancer cells can be altered by miR21 delivered by exosomes derived from neighbouring stromal cells in the omental tumour microenvironment, and that inhibiting the transfer of stromal-derived miR21 is an alternative modality in the treatment of metastatic and recurrent ovarian cancer.

The Novel Methods for Analysis of Exosomes Released from Endothelial Cells and Endothelial Progenitor Cells.	Stem Cells Int	2016	Exosomes (EXs) are cell-derived vesicles that mediate cell-cell communication and could serve as biomarkers. Here we described novel methods for purification and phenotyping of EXs released from endothelial cells (ECs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) by combining microbeads and fluorescence quantum dots (Q-dots®) techniques. EXs from the culture medium of ECs and EPCs were isolated and detected with cell-specific antibody conjugated microbeads and second antibody conjugated Q-dots by using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) system. The sensitivities of the cell origin markers for ECs (CD105, CD144) and EPCs (CD34, KDR) were evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity were determined by using positive and negative markers for EXs (CD63), platelets (CD41), erythrocytes (CD235a), and microvesicles (Annexin V). Moreover, the methods were further validated in particle-free plasma and patient samples. Results showed that anti-CD105/anti-CD144 and anti-CD34/anti-KDR had the highest sensitivity and specificity for isolating and detecting EC-EXs and EPC-EXs, respectively. The methods had the overall recovery rate of over 70% and were able to detect the dynamical changes of circulating EC-EXs and EPC-EXs in acute ischemic stroke. In conclusion, we have developed sensitive and specific microbeads/Q-dots fluorescence NTA methods for EC-EX and EPC-EX isolation and detection, which will facilitate the functional study and biomarker discovery.

Exosomes Secreted by Toxoplasma gondii-Infected L6 Cells: Their Effects on Host Cell Proliferation and Cell Cycle Changes.	Korean J Parasitol	2016	Toxoplasma gondii infection induces alteration of the host cell cycle and cell proliferation. These changes are not only seen in directly invaded host cells but also in neighboring cells. We tried to identify whether this alteration can be mediated by exosomes secreted by T. gondii-infected host cells. L6 cells, a rat myoblast cell line, and RH strain of T. gondii were selected for this study. L6 cells were infected with or without T. gondii to isolate exosomes. The cellular growth patterns were identified by cell counting with trypan blue under confocal microscopy, and cell cycle changes were investigated by flow cytometry. L6 cells infected with T. gondii showed decreased proliferation compared to uninfected L6 cells and revealed a tendency to stay at S or G2/M cell phase. The treatment of exosomes isolated from T. gondii-infected cells showed attenuation of cell proliferation and slight enhancement of S phase in L6 cells. The cell cycle alteration was not as obvious as reduction of the cell proliferation by the exosome treatment. These changes were transient and disappeared at 48 hr after the exosome treatment. Microarray analysis and web-based tools indicated that various exosomal miRNAs were crucial for the regulation of target genes related to cell proliferation. Collectively, our study demonstrated that the exosomes originating from T. gondii could change the host cell proliferation and alter the host cell cycle.	PMC4870968

Diabetes	2016	Decreased heat shock protein (Hsp) expression in type 1 and type 2 diabetes has been implicated as a primary factor contributing to diabetes-induced organ damage. We recently showed that diabetic cardiomyocytes could release detrimental exosomes, which contain lower levels of Hsp20 than normal ones. To investigate whether such detrimental exosomes could be modified in cardiomyocytes by raising Hsp20 levels to become protective, we used a transgenic (TG) mouse model with cardiac-specific overexpression of Hsp20. TG and control wild-type (WT) mice were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes. We observed that overexpression of Hsp20 significantly attenuated STZ-caused cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, apoptosis, fibrosis, and microvascular rarefaction. Moreover, Hsp20-TG cardiomyocytes exhibited an increased generation/secretion of exosomes by direct interaction of Hsp20 with Tsg101. Of importance, exosomes derived from TG cardiomyocytes encased higher levels of Hsp20, p-Akt, survivin, and SOD1 than WT exosomes and protected against in vitro hyperglycemia-triggered cell death, as well as in vivo STZ-induced cardiac adverse remodeling. Last, blockade of exosome generation by GW4869 remarkably offset Hsp20-mediated cardioprotection in diabetic mice. Our results indicate that elevation of Hsp20 in cardiomyocytes can offer protection in diabetic hearts through the release of instrumental exosomes. Thus, Hsp20-engineered exosomes might be a novel therapeutic agent for diabetic cardiomyopathy.	PMC5033265

Electronic address: .	alevizosi@nidcr.nih.gov		Targeting the Ca(2+) Sensor STIM1 by Exosomal Transfer of Ebv-miR-BART13-3p is Associated with Sjögren's Syndrome.	EBioMedicine	2016	Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that is associated with inflammation and dysfunction of salivary and lacrimal glands. The molecular mechanism(s) underlying this exocrinopathy is not known, although the syndrome has been associated with viruses, such as the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). We report herein that an EBV-specific microRNA (ebv-miR-BART13-3p) is significantly elevated in salivary glands (SGs) of pSS patients and we show that it targets stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1), a primary regulator of the store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) pathway that is essential for SG function, leading to loss of SOCE and Ca(2+)-dependent activation of NFAT. Although EBV typically infects B cells and not salivary epithelial cells, ebv-miR-BART13-3p is present in both cell types in pSS SGs. Importantly, we further demonstrate that ebv-miR-BART13-3p can be transferred from B cells to salivary epithelial cells through exosomes and it recapitulates its functional effects on calcium signaling in a model system.

Real time and label free profiling of clinically relevant exosomes.	Sci Rep	2016	Tumor-derived exosomes possess significant clinical relevance due to their unique composition of genetic and protein material that is representative of the parent tumor. Specific isolation as well as identification of proportions of these clinically relevant exosomes (CREs) from biological samples could help to better understand their clinical significance as cancer biomarkers. Herein, we present a simple approach for quantification of the proportion of CREs within the bulk exosome population isolated from patient serum. This proportion of CREs can potentially inform on the disease stage and enable non-invasive monitoring of inter-individual variations in tumor-receptor expression levels. Our approach utilises a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) platform to quantify the proportion of CREs in a two-step strategy that involves (i) initial isolation of bulk exosome population using tetraspanin biomarkers (i.e., CD9, CD63), and (ii) subsequent detection of CREs within the captured bulk exosomes using tumor-specific markers (e.g., human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)). We demonstrate the isolation of bulk exosome population and detection of as low as 10% HER2(+) exosomes from samples containing designated proportions of HER2(+) BT474 and HER2(-) MDA-MB-231 cell derived exosomes. We also demonstrate the successful isolation of exosomes from a small cohort of breast cancer patient samples and identified that approximately 14-35% of their bulk population express HER2.

J Pathol	2016	Recent studies have shown that extracellular microRNAs are not only potential biomarkers but are also involved in cell interactions to regulate the intercommunication between cancer cells and their microenvironments in various types of malignancies. In this study, we isolated exosomes from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines and patient sera (T-EXOs), or control NP69 cells and healthy donor sera (HD-EXOs). We found that miR-24-3p was markedly enriched in T-EXOs as compared with HD-EXOs; the serum exosomal miR-24-3p level was correlated with worse disease-free survival of patients (p < 0.05). Knockdown of exosomal miR-24-3p (miR-24-3p-sponge-T-EXOs) by a sponge RNA targeting miR-24-3p restored the T-EXO-mediated (control-sponge-T-EXO) inhibition of T-cell proliferation and Th1 and Th17 differentiation, and the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Mechanistic analyses revealed that administration of exosomal miR-24-3p increased P-ERK, P-STAT1 and P-STAT3 expression while decreasing P-STAT5 expression during T-cell proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, by in vivo and in vitro assessments, we found FGF11 to be a direct target of miR-24-3p. However, both miR-24-3p-sponge-T-EXOs and T-EXOs (control-sponge-T-EXOs) impeded proliferation and Th1 and Th17 differentiation, but induced Treg differentiation, of lenti-shFGF11-transfected T cells. The levels of phosphorylated ERK and STAT proteins were different in lenti-ScshRNA-transfected T cells and lenti-shFGF11-transfected T cells following administration of miR-24-3p-sponge-T-EXO. Interestingly, tumour FGF11 expression was positively correlated with the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo, and predicted favourable patient DFS (p < 0.05). Additionally, hypoxia increased cellular and exosomal miR-24-3p levels and enhanced the inhibitory effect of T-EXO on T-cell proliferation and differentiation. Collectively, our findings suggest that exosomal miR-24-3p is involved in tumour pathogenesis by mediating T-cell suppression via repression of FGF11, and may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in NPC.

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2016	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disorder that involves the death of motor neurons in the cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are considered as a perspective remedy for therapy of neurodegenerative diseases including ALS. Stem cells secrete various factors which can modulate a hostile environment, called paracrine effect. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles containing cell derived factors and mediate paracrine effect of cells. Thus, exosomes from ADSCs (ADSC-exo) can be a potential candidate of therapeutic effects of stem cells. To investigate the effect of ADSC-exo on the cellular phenotypes of ALS, we used neuronal stem cells (NSCs), which can be differentiated into neuronal cells, isolated from wild type or G93A ALS mice model. ADSC-exo was treated to neuronal cells from G93A ALS mice model. Immunocytochemistry and dot-blot assay result showed that ADSC-exo alleviated aggregation of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Reduction of cytosolic SOD1 level by ADSC-exo was also confirmed by western blot. Mitochondria display various abnormalities in ALS and the decrease of phospho-CREB and PGC-1α were observed in the G93A cells. ADSC-exo treatment showed normalization of phospho-CREB/CREB ratio and PGC-1α expression level. Our results suggest that ADSC-exo modulates cellular phenotypes of ALS including SOD-1 aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction, and can be a therapeutic candidate for ALS.

J Exp Clin Cancer Res	2016	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are carriers of intercellular information and regulate the tumor microenvironment. They play an important role in drug resistance by transporting RNA molecules and proteins. However, their effects on sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not completely understood. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from two invasive hepatoma cell lines (MHCC-97 L and MHCC-97H), and their roles in regulating sorafenib resistance in liver cancer cells as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms were determined. The exosomes were analyzed by TEM (transmission electron microscopy), DLS (dynamic light scattering) and Western blotting. Cell viability, cell death and the effects of exosomes on the HGF/c-Met/Akt signaling pathway in cancer cells were analyzed by MTT assays, FACS analysis and Western blotting, respectively. Moreover, the effects of exosomes on sorafenib resistance in vivo were investigated using a subcutaneous transplantation tumor model in athymic nude mice. RESULTS: Exosomes derived from HCC cells were of the expected size and expressed the exosomal markers CD9 and CD63. They induced sorafenib resistance in vitro by activating the HGF/c-Met/Akt signaling pathway and inhibiting sorafenib-induced apoptosis. They also induced sorafenib resistance in vivo by inhibiting sorafenib-induced apoptosis. Moreover, exosomes derived from highly invasive tumor cells had greater efficacy than that of exosomes derived from less invasive cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal the important role of HCC cell-derived exosomes in the drug resistance of liver cancer cells and demonstrate the intrinsic interaction between exosomes and their targeted tumor cells. This study suggests a new strategy for improving the effectiveness of sorafenib in treating HCC.	PMC5045585

Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci	2016	OBJECTIVE: In this study, we firstly compared the loading of urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) in exosomes between tamoxifen sensitive and tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cells and further investigated the role of exosomal transfer of UCA1 in the development of tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from the culture medium of tamoxifen sensitive MCF-7 cells and tamoxifen resistant LCC2 cells. QRT-PCR was performed to analyze UCA1 expression in cells and exosomes. CCK-8 assay, immunofluorescence staining of cleaved caspase-3 and flow cytometric analysis of annexin V/PI staining were used to assess tamoxifen sensitivity. RESULTS: UCA1 is significantly increased not only in LCC2 cells, but also in exosomes released from LCC2 cells. The increase in exosomes is more evident than in cells. MCF-7 cells pretreated with exos/LCC2 had a significantly increased cell viability, a decreased expression of cleaved caspase-3 and a lower ratio of apoptosis after tamoxifen treatment. The exos/LCC2 with impaired UCA1 loading had significantly suppressed capability to promote tamoxifen resistance in MCF-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: UCA1 is significantly loaded in exosomes from tamoxifen resistant LCC2 cells. Exosomes mediated transfer of UCA1 can significantly increase tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive MCF-7 cells.

J Exp Clin Cancer Res	2016	BACKGROUND: Release of exosomes have been shown to play critical roles in drug resistance by delivering cargo. Targeting the transfer of exosomes from resistant cells to sensitive cells may be an approach to overcome some cases of drug resistance. METHOD: In this study, we investigated the potential role of exosomes in the process of psoralen reverse multidrug resistance of MCF-7/ADR cells. Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation of culture media from MCF-7/ADR cells (ADR/exo) and MCF-7 parental cells (S/exo). Exosomes were characterized by morphology, exosomal markers and size distribution. The ability of ADR/exo to transfer multidrug resistance was assessed by MTT and real-time quantitative PCR. The different formation and secretion of exosomes were detected by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Then we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis using RNA-Seq technology and real-time quantitative PCR to better understand the gene expression regulation in exosmes formation and release after psoralen treatment. RESULTS: Our data showed that exosomes derived from MCF-7/ADR cells were able to promote active sequestration of drugs and could induce a drug resistance phenotype by transferring drug-resistance-related gene MDR-1 and P-glycoprotein protein. Psoralen could reduce the formation and secretion of exosomes to overcome drug resistance. There were 21 differentially expressed genes. Gene ontology (GO) pathway analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that the most significantly expressed genes were linked to PPAR and P53 signaling pathways which were related to exosomes formation, secretion and cargo sorting. CONCLUSIONS: Psoralen can affect the exosomes and induce the reduction of resistance transmission via exosomes might through PPAR and P53 signaling pathways, which might provide a novel strategy for breast cancer resistance to chemotherapy in the future.

Defining the purity of exosomes required for diagnostic profiling of small RNA suitable for biomarker discovery.	RNA Biol	2017	Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), including microRNAs (miRNA), enclosed in exosomes are being utilised for biomarker discovery in disease. Two common exosome isolation methods involve differential ultracentrifugation or differential ultracentrifugation coupled with Optiprep gradient fractionation. Generally, the incorporation of an Optiprep gradient provides better separation and increased purity of exosomes. The question of whether increased purity of exosomes is required for small ncRNA profiling, particularly in diagnostic and biomarker purposes, has not been addressed and highly debated. Utilizing an established neuronal cell system, we used next-generation sequencing to comprehensively profile ncRNA in cells and exosomes isolated by these 2 isolation methods. By comparing ncRNA content in exosomes from these two methods, we found that exosomes from both isolation methods were enriched with miRNAs and contained a diverse range of rRNA, small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA and piwi-interacting RNA as compared with their cellular counterparts. Additionally, tRNA fragments (30-55 nucleotides in length) were identified in exosomes and may act as potential modulators for repressing protein translation. Overall, the outcome of this study confirms that ultracentrifugation-based method as a feasible approach to identify ncRNA biomarkers in exosomes.	PMC5324750

J Transl Med	2017	BACKGROUND: Sepsis delays wound re-epithelialization. In this study we explored the effect of human sepsis sera as well as the effects of cytokines, growth factors and exosomes of sepsis sera treated normal fibroblasts (NF) on keratinocyte migration and proliferation in vitro. METHODS: Serum samples were taken on days 1, 4, and 9 from 44 patients diagnosed with severe sepsis, and from 14 matching healthy controls. We evaluated the effects of sepsis serum with or without TNF-α, EGF, EGF receptor inhibitor or exosomes of sepsis sera treated NF on human keratinocyte (HaCaT) proliferation (BrdU assay), viability (MTT assay), and migration (horizontal wound healing model). Cytokine levels of sepsis and healthy sera were measured by multiplex assay. Comparisons between groups were carried out using SPSS statistics and P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Severe-sepsis sera collected on days 1, 4, and 9 reduced keratinocyte proliferation by 6% (P = 0.005), 20% (P = 0.001), and 18% (P = 0.002), respectively, compared to control sera. Cell viability in cultures exposed to sepsis sera from days 4 and 9 was reduced by 38% (P = 0.01) and 58% (P < 0.001), respectively. Open-surface wounds exposed to sepsis sera from days 1 and 4 were larger than those exposed to sera from healthy controls (60 vs. 31%, P = 0.034 and 66 vs. 31%, P = 0.023, respectively). Exosomes of sepsis or healthy sera treated NF inhibited keratinocyte migration. We detected higher serum levels of cytokines TNF-α (5.7 vs. 0.7 pg/ml, P < 0.001), IL-6 (24.8 vs. 3.8 pg/ml, P < 0.001), IL-10 (30.0 vs. 11.9 pg/ml, P = 0.040), and VEGF (177.9 vs. 48.1 pg/ml, P = 0.018) in sepsis sera. Levels of EGF were significantly lower in sepsis sera than in that of healthy controls (6.5 vs. 115.6 pg/ml, P < 0.001). Sepsis serum supplemented with EGF 5 ng/ml and TNF-α in all concentrations improved keratinocyte migration. CONCLUSIONS: Keratinocyte viability, proliferation and migration were reduced in severe sepsis in vitro. Exosomes from NF added in healthy or sepsis serum media inhibited keratinocyte migration. Decreased levels of EGF in sepsis sera may partially explain the delay of wound healing with severe-sepsis patients. Increased levels of TNF-α in sepsis sera do not explain diminished keratinocyte migration.	PMC5237124

Mol Ther	2017	The pericardial fluid (PF) is contained in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. MicroRNA (miRNA) exchange via exosomes (endogenous nanoparticles) contributes to cell-to-cell communication. We investigated the hypotheses that the PF is enriched with miRNAs secreted by the heart and that it mediates vascular responses through exosome exchange of miRNAs. The study was developed using leftover material from aortic valve surgery. We found that in comparison with peripheral plasma, the PF contains exosomes enriched with miRNAs co-expressed in patients' myocardium and vasculature. At a functional level, PF exosomes improved survival, proliferation, and networking of cultured endothelial cells (ECs) and restored the angiogenic capacity of ECs depleted (via Dicer silencing) of their endogenous miRNA content. Moreover, PF exosomes improved post-ischemic blood flow recovery and angiogenesis in mice. Mechanistically, (1) let-7b-5p is proangiogenic and inhibits its target gene, TGFBR1, in ECs; (2) PF exosomes transfer a functional let-7b-5p to ECs, thus reducing their TGFBR1 expression; and (3) let-7b-5p depletion in PF exosomes impairs the angiogenic response to these nanoparticles. Collectively, our data support the concept that PF exosomes orchestrate vascular repair via miRNA transfer.	PMC5363195

Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Serum Exosomes from Patients with Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Undergoing Chemoradiotherapy.	J Proteome Res	2017	Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the USA. Despite extensive research, minimal improvements in patient outcomes have been achieved. Early identification of treatment response and metastasis would be valuable to determine the appropriate therapeutic course for patients. In this work, we isolated exosomes from the serum of 10 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer at serial time points over a course of therapy, and quantitative analysis was performed using the iTRAQ method. We detected approximately 700-800 exosomal proteins per sample, several of which have been implicated in metastasis and treatment resistance. We compared the exosomal proteome of patients at different time points during treatment to healthy controls and identified eight proteins that show global treatment-specific changes. We then tested the effect of patient-derived exosomes on the migration of tumor cells and found that patient-derived exosomes, but not healthy controls, induce cell migration, supporting their role in metastasis. Our data show that exosomes can be reliably extracted from patient serum and analyzed for protein content. The differential loading of exosomes during a course of therapy suggests that exosomes may provide novel insights into the development of treatment resistance and metastasis.	PMC5462613

Biosens Bioelectron	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are abundant in various biological fluids including blood, saliva, urine, as well as extracellular milieu. Accumulating evidence has indicated that EVs, which contain functional proteins and small RNAs, facilitate intercellular communication between neighbouring cells, and are critical to maintain various physiological processes. In contrast, EV-derived toxic signals can spread out over the tissues adjacent to the injured area in certain diseases, including brain tumors and neurodegenerative disorders. This demands better characterization of EVs which can be employed for liquid biopsy clinically as well as for the study of intercellular signalling. Exosomes and microvesicles share a number of similar characteristics, but it is important to distinguish between these two types of EVs. Here, we report for the first time that our in-house developed Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance biosensor with self-assembly gold nanoislands (SAM-AuNIs) can be used to detect and distinguish exosomes from MVs isolated from A-549 cells, SH-SY5Y cells, blood serum, and urine from a lung cancer mouse model. Exosomes, compared with MVs, produced a distinguishable response to the bare LSPR biosensor without functionalization, suggesting a different biophysical interaction between exosomes and MVs with SAM AuNIs. This sensor attains the limit of detection to 0.194µg/ml, and the linear dynamic range covers 0.194-100µg/ml. This discovery not only reveals great insight into the distinctive membrane property of tumor-derived exosomes and MVs, but also facilitate the development of novel LSPR biosensors for direct detection and isolation of heterogeneous EVs.

Electronic address: .	nils.back@helsinki.fi		The endocytic pathways of a secretory granule membrane protein in HEK293 cells: PAM and EGF traverse a dynamic multivesicular body network together.	Eur J Cell Biol	2017	Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) is highly expressed in neurons and endocrine cells, where it catalyzes one of the final steps in the biosynthesis of bioactive peptides. PAM is also expressed in unicellular organisms such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which do not store peptides in secretory granules. As for other granule membrane proteins, PAM is retrieved from the cell surface and returned to the trans-Golgi network. This pathway involves regulated entry of PAM into multivesicular body intralumenal vesicles (ILVs). The aim of this study was defining the endocytic pathways utilized by PAM in cells that do not store secretory products in granules. Using stably transfected HEK293 cells, endocytic trafficking of PAM was compared to that of the mannose 6-phosphate (MPR) and EGF (EGFR) receptors, established markers for the endosome to trans-Golgi network and degradative pathways, respectively. As in neuroendocrine cells, PAM internalized by HEK293 cells accumulated in the trans-Golgi network. Based on surface biotinylation, >70% of the PAM on the cell surface was recovered intact after a 4h chase and soluble, bifunctional PAM was produced. Endosomes containing PAM generally contained both EGFR and MPR and ultrastructural analysis confirmed that all three cargos accumulated in ILVs. PAM containing multivesicular bodies made frequent dynamic tubular contacts with younger and older multivesicular bodies. Frequent dynamic contacts were observed between lysosomes and PAM containing early endosomes and multivesicular bodies. The ancient ability of PAM to localize to ciliary membranes, which release bioactive ectosomes, may be related to its ability to accumulate in ILVs and exosomes.	PMC5592135

MicroRNA-21 Is Required for Local and Remote Ischemic Preconditioning in Multiple Organ Protection Against Sepsis.	Crit Care Med	2017	OBJECTIVE: Sepsis, triggered by microbial infection, is a common and life-threatening systemic illness, often leads to impaired function of vital organs. Ischemic preconditioning induced by transient brief episodes of ischemia is a powerful innate mechanism of organ protection. We have reported that a 15-minute renal ischemic preconditioning substantially attenuated subsequent renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Here, we investigate whether a brief ischemia and reperfusion in kidney can provide protection at local and remote sites against sepsis-induced organ injury, and whether this protection is microRNA-21 dependent. DESIGN: Laboratory study. SETTING: University laboratory. SUBJECTS: Mouse renal tubular epithelial cells, C57BL/6 J wildtype (Animal Center of Fudan University, Shanghai, China) and microRNA-21-/- mice (B6.129-Mir21atm1Smoc, Shanghai Biomodel Organism Science & Technology Development Co. Shanghai, China). INTERVENTIONS: Mouse renal tubular epithelial cells were treated with hypoxia (2% oxygen). Renal ischemic preconditioning was induced by bilateral renal pedicle clamping for 15 minutes, and sepsis was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide at a dose of 20 mg/kg or cecal ligation and puncture in mice. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mice treated with renal ischemic preconditioning were protected from endotoxemia or polymicrobial sepsis-induced multiple organ injury, including kidneys, heart, liver, and lungs. Renal ischemic preconditioning induced activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in kidneys, which up-regulated microRNA-21 at transcriptional level, subsequently, leading to increased expression of microRNA-21 in serum exosomes and remote organs, resulting in decreased apoptosis and reduced proinflammatory cytokines production in these organs. In vivo knockdown of microRNA-21 or genetic deletion of microRNA-21 abrogated the organoprotective effects conferred by renal ischemic preconditioning. Mechanistically, we discovered that knockdown of microRNA-21 increased programmed cell death protein 4 expression and nuclear factor-kappa B activity, decreased expression of anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2. CONCLUSION: MicroRNA-21 is required for local and remote ischemic preconditioning in multiple organ protection against sepsis, and up-regulation of miR-21 may be a potential therapy for sepsis.

Tumour exosomes from cells harbouring PTPRZ1-MET fusion contribute to a malignant phenotype and temozolomide chemoresistance in glioblastoma.	Oncogene	2017	Exosomes are carriers of pro-tumorigenic factors that participate in glioblastoma (GBM) progression, and many fusion genes are strong driver mutations in neoplasia and are involved in tumorigenesis. However, the ability of fusion genes to be transduced by exosomes is unknown. We characterized exosomes from GBM cells harbouring and not harbouring PTPRZ1-MET fusion (ZM fusion). We also determined the effect of the exosomes from ZM fusion cells (ZM exosomes) on pro-oncogenic secretions and showed that ZM exosomes are internalized by the recipient cells. In addition, we studied the effect of ZM exosome-mediated intercellular communication in the GBM microenvironment. MET proto-oncogene expression was higher in ZM exosomes. Moreover, phosphorylated MET was detected only in ZM exosomes and not in exosomes released by non-ZM fusion GBM cells. ZM exosomes transferred to non-ZM fusion GBM cells and normal human astrocytes altered gene expression and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The uptake of ZM exosomes also induced an exosome-dependent phenotype defined by GBM cell migration and invasion, neurosphere growth and angiogenesis. In addition, ZM exosomes conferred temozolomide resistance to the GBM cells, and exosome-derived ZM fusion network proteins targeted multiple pro-oncogenic effectors in recipient cells within the GBM microenvironment. Our findings show that exosomes mediate the aggressive character of GBM and demonstrate the role of ZM fusion in the exacerbation of this effect. These findings have possible implications for the foundation of gene fusion-based therapy for managing GBM.	PMC5611480

Second generation multiple reaction monitoring assays for enhanced detection of ultra-low abundance Mycobacterium tuberculosis peptides in human serum.	Clin Proteomics	2017	BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of Tuberculosis (TB), the number one cause of death due to an infectious disease. TB diagnosis is performed by microscopy, culture or PCR amplification of bacterial DNA, all of which require patient sputum or the biopsy of infected tissue. Detection of mycobacterial products in serum, as biomarkers of diagnosis or disease status would provide an improvement over current methods. Due to the low-abundance of mycobacterial products in serum, we have explored exosome enrichment to improve sensitivity. Mtb resides intracellularly where its secreted proteins have been shown to be packaged into host exosomes and released into the bloodstream. Exosomes can be readily purified assuring an enrichment of mycobacterial analytes from the complex mix of host serum proteins. METHODS: Multiple reaction monitoring assays were optimized for the enhanced detection of 41 Mtb peptides in exosomes purified from the serum of individuals with TB. Exosomes isolated from the serum of healthy individuals was used to create and validate a unique data analysis algorithm and identify filters to reduce the rate of false positives, attributed to host m/z interference. The final optimized method was tested in 40 exosome samples from TB positive patients. RESULTS: Our enhanced methods provide limit of detection and quantification averaging in the low femtomolar range for detection of mycobacterial products in serum. At least one mycobacterial peptide was identified in 92.5% of the TB positive patients. Four peptides from the Mtb proteins, Cfp2, Mpt32, Mpt64 and BfrB, show normalized total peak areas significantly higher in individuals with active TB as compared to healthy controls; three of the peptides from these proteins have not previously been associated with serum exosomes from individuals with active TB disease. Some of the detected peptides were significantly associated with specific geographical locations, highlighting potential markers that can be linked to the Mtb strains circulating within each given region. CONCLUSIONS: An enhanced MRM method to detect ultra-low abundance Mtb peptides in human serum exosomes is demonstrated, highlighting the potential of this methodology for TB diagnostic biomarker development.

Orthod Craniofac Res	2017	OBJECTIVES: 1) To test the hypothesis that there would be proteomic differences in the composition of exosomes isolated from osteoclasts and odontoclasts and 2) to determine the clinical usefulness of these in vitro biomarker candidates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse bone marrow-derived precursors were cultured on either dentin or bone slices and allowed to mature and begin resorption. Exosomes were isolated from cell culture media and characterized by mass spectrometry. The proteomic data obtained from this in vitro study were compared with the data obtained from human samples in our previous work. RESULTS: There was a difference in the proteomic composition of exosomes from osteoclasts and odontoclasts. A total of 40 exosomal proteins were only present in osteoclast media, whereas six unique exosomal proteins were identified in odontoclast supernatants. Approximately 50% of exosomal proteins released by clastic cells in vitro can be found in oral fluids. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the mineralized matrix type plays a role in the final phenotypic characteristics of mouse clastic cells. Many in vitro biomarker candidates of bone and dentin resorption can also be found in human oral fluids, thus indicating that this approach may be a viable alternative in biomarker discovery.

Targeting Human Astrocytes' Calcium-sensing Receptors for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.	Curr Pharm Des	2017	Understanding the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the principal human neural cells is necessary for finding therapeutics for this illness. To help do this, we have been using freshly cultured functionally normal cerebral cortical adult human astrocytes (NAHAs) and postnatal neurons. The findings show that amyloid-β oligomers (Aβ-os) binding to calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) on NAHAs and neuron surfaces trigger signals capable of driving AD pathogenesis. This Aβ•CaSR signalling shifts the amyloid precursor protein (APP) from its α-secretase shedding producing neurotrophic/neuroprotective soluble (s)APPα to its β-secretase cleaving engendering AD-driving Aβ42/Aβ42-os peptides. Aβ•CaSR signalling in NAHAs also drives the release of toxic hyper-phosphorylated Tau proteins in exosomes, and of nitric oxide, and VEGF-A. These several harmful agents comprise the neuron-killing machinery, driving the very slowly spreading AD neurocontagion. VEGF-A over-secretion from Aβ-exposed blood vessel-attached astrocytes induces a functional magnetic resonance imaging- detectable hippocampal neoangiogenesis which indicates approaching AD in amnestic minor cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. Most important in AD's regard, selective allosteric CaSR antagonists (calcylitics) added to Aβ42/Aβ42-os-exposed NAHAs (or to human neuron cultures) rescue the extracellular shedding of neurotrophic/ neuroprotective sAPPα and suppress all the neurotoxic effects of Aβ•CaSR signalling even when multiple microglial cytokines are also present. Therefore, since the multipotent calcilytics would be reasonably safe and inexpensive drugs for humans, it is worthwhile testing them as AD therapeutics in clinical trials especially in persons in the earliest detectable stages of AD neuropathology progression such as aMCI.

MicroRNA-30a ameliorates hepatic fibrosis by inhibiting Beclin1-mediated autophagy.	J Cell Mol Med	2017	We explored the role of microRNA-30a (miR-30a) and the mechanism involved in hepatic fibrosis. MiR-30a overexpression was achieved by miR-30a mimics transfection in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) (HSC-T6, LX-2), and miR-30a agomir (ago-miR-30a) treatment in mice. MiR-30a levels were measured using TaqMan miRNA assay system, and the localization of miR-30a was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The interaction of miR-30a and Beclin1 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Autophagic flux was analysed using tandem mRFP-GFP-LC3 fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy and Western blot of LC3-II/I ratio. MiR-30a was notably down-regulated in activated HSCs and LX-2-exosomes induced by TGF-β1; overexpression of miR-30a down-regulated extracellular matrix (ECM), such as α-SMA, TIMP-1, and Collagen I expression, and suppressed cell viability in HSCs. MiR-30a was significantly down-regulated in hepatic fibrosis mice and overexpression of miR-30a prevented BDL-induced fibrogenesis, concomitant with the down-regulation of ECM. MiR-30a inhibited HSCs autophagy and increased lipid accumulation in HSCs and in mice fibrotic hepatic tissues. MiR-30a inhibited its downstream effector of Beclin1 by direct targeting its 3'-UTR region. Moreover, Knock-down of Beclin1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited HSC autophagy and activation in LX-2 cells. In conclusion, miR-30a is down-regulated in hepatic fibrosis models and its overexpression prevents liver fibrogenesis by directly suppressing Beclin1-mediated autophagy; therefore, miR-30a may be a new potential therapeutic target for controlling hepatic fibrosis.

Methods Mol Biol	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived vesicles comprising a lipid bilayer and are found in body fluids, such as blood, sweat, and urine. As EVs, especially exosomes, function as endogenous intercellular delivery tools, their roles in various biological events have been extensively investigated. In addition, they are expected to become safe and effective drug delivery systems (DDS) because of their intrinsic nature. In the development of EV-based DDS, as well as in the investigation of the biological functions of EVs, it is important to analyze the in vivo behavior of EVs by tracking them. Therefore, we have developed a sensitive EV-labeling method to track EVs in vivo by designing a fusion protein comprising lactadherin (LA) (alias milk fat globule-EGF factor 8), a protein that binds to EV membranes through interaction with phosphatidylserine, and Gaussia luciferase (gLuc), a chemiluminescent protein. gLuc-LA-labeled EVs are easily obtained by transfecting EV-producing cells with a gLuc-LA-encoding plasmid vector. Here, we describe methods to label EVs with the fusion protein and to track the labeled EVs in vivo.

Microvesicles released during the interaction between Trypanosoma cruzi TcI and TcII strains and host blood cells inhibit complement system and increase the infectivity of metacyclic forms of host cells in a strain-independent process.	Pathog Dis	2017	Extracellular vesicles, whether microvesicles (MVs) or exosomes, shed by pathogens transfer virulence factors and biomolecules to host cells, thereby altering the host's susceptibility to infection. We have previously demonstrated that MV release is increased during the interaction between the infective forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and host cells. MVs confer parasite resistance to complement-mediated lysis and enhance parasite invasion. In this study, we show that differences exist in the levels of MVs released during the interaction between metacyclic trypomastigotes of different T. cruzi strains (with varied sensitivity to complement-mediated lysis, namely sensitive G strain TcI and resistant Y strain TcII) and host cells. MVs produced during the interaction between TcII parasites and host cells increased parasite resistance to complement lysis from 50% to 80% and parasite invasion was increased to over 50%. MVs purified during the interaction between TcI parasites and host cells have a stronger effect, doubling complement resistance and parasite invasion. The complement-mediated lysis assays showed that all MVs inhibit mainly the lectin pathway. Interestingly, MVs derived from parasites of one class did not alter complement resistance and the invasion process of parasites from the other class. This is the first description of MVs from T. cruzi with strain-dependent phenotypic effects.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2017	Exosomes are nanoscale extracellular vesicles that play an important role in many biological processes, including intercellular communications, antigen presentation, and the transport of proteins, RNA, and other molecules. Recently there has been significant interest in exosome-related fundamental research, seeking new exosome-based biomarkers for health monitoring and disease diagnoses. Here, we report a separation method based on acoustofluidics (i.e., the integration of acoustics and microfluidics) to isolate exosomes directly from whole blood in a label-free and contact-free manner. This acoustofluidic platform consists of two modules: a microscale cell-removal module that first removes larger blood components, followed by extracellular vesicle subgroup separation in the exosome-isolation module. In the cell-removal module, we demonstrate the isolation of 110-nm particles from a mixture of micro- and nanosized particles with a yield greater than 99%. In the exosome-isolation module, we isolate exosomes from an extracellular vesicle mixture with a purity of 98.4%. Integrating the two acoustofluidic modules onto a single chip, we isolated exosomes from whole blood with a blood cell removal rate of over 99.999%. With its ability to perform rapid, biocompatible, label-free, contact-free, and continuous-flow exosome isolation, the integrated acoustofluidic device offers a unique approach to investigate the role of exosomes in the onset and progression of human diseases with potential applications in health monitoring, medical diagnosis, targeted drug delivery, and personalized medicine.

Enhanced Class I Tumor Antigen Presentation via Cytosolic Delivery of Exosomal Cargos by Tumor-Cell-Derived Exosomes Displaying a pH-Sensitive Fusogenic Peptide.	Mol Pharm	2017	Tumor-cell-derived exosomes contain endogenous tumor antigens and can be used as a potential cancer vaccine without requiring identification of the tumor-specific antigen. To elicit an effective antitumor effect, efficient tumor antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules on dendritic cells (DC) is desirable. Because DC endocytose exosomes, an endosomal escape mechanism is required for efficient MHC class I presentation of exosomal tumor antigens. In the present study, efficient cytosolic delivery of exosomal tumor antigens was performed using genetically engineered tumor-cell-derived exosomes and pH-sensitive fusogenic GALA peptide. Murine melanoma B16BL6 cells were transfected with a plasmid vector encoding a streptavidin (SAV; a protein that binds to biotin with high affinity)-lactadherin (LA; an exosome-tropic protein) fusion protein to obtain SAV-LA-modified exosomes (SAV-exo). SAV-exo was mixed with biotinylated GALA to obtain GALA-modified exosomes (GALA-exo). Fluorescent microscopic observation using fluorescent-labeled GALA showed that the exosomes were modified with GALA. GALA-exo exerted a membrane-lytic activity under acidic conditions and efficiently delivered exosomal cargos to the cytosol. Moreover, DC treated with GALA-exo showed enhanced tumor antigen presentation capacity by MHC class I molecules. Thus, genetically engineered GALA-exo are effective in controlling the intracellular traffic of tumor-cell-derived exosomes and for enhancing tumor antigen presentation capacity.

Sci Rep	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes, have been identified as regulators of vascular remodeling and have promise as therapeutics for vascularization applications. Towards development of EVs as therapeutics, it has been demonstrated that physiological stimuli of angiogenic phenotypes in EV-producing cells can enhance the potency of EVs for vascularization. The goal of this study was to assess whether ethanol, which induces angiogenic phenotypes in endothelial cells, could be employed to enhance endothelial-derived EV vascularization bioactivity. The results indicate that ethanol conditioning of endothelial cells increases the ability of endothelial EVs to induce a pro-vascularization response. This response is due in part to increased CD34 expression in recipient endothelial cells that may result from downregulation of microRNA-106b in EVs isolated from ethanol-conditioned producer endothelial cells. Further, ethanol-induced upregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) HOTAIR and MALAT1 in endothelial EVs was observed to play a significant role in mediating pro-angiogenic effects of these vesicles. Overall, these studies validate ethanol conditioning as a method to enhance the bioactivity of endothelial EVs via regulation of EV-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) and, especially, lncRNAs. Further, the results suggest that alcohol consumption may activate endothelial EVs towards a pro-vascularization phenotype, which could have implications for alcohol-induced tumor angiogenesis.

Cellular and exosome mediated molecular defense mechanism in bovine granulosa cells exposed to oxidative stress.	PLoS One	2017	Various environmental insults including diseases, heat and oxidative stress could lead to abnormal growth, functions and apoptosis in granulosa cells during ovarian follicle growth and oocyte maturation. Despite the fact that cells exposed to oxidative stress are responding transcriptionally, the potential release of transcripts associated with oxidative stress response into extracellular space through exosomes is not yet determined. Therefore, here we aimed to investigate the effect of oxidative stress in bovine granulosa cells in vitro on the cellular and exosome mediated defense mechanisms. Bovine granulosa cells were aspirated from ovarian follicles and cultured in DMEM/F-12 Ham culture medium supplemented with 10% exosome-depleted fetal bovine serum. In the first experiment sub-confluent cells were treated with 5 μM H2O2 for 40 min to induce oxidative stress. Thereafter, cells were subjected to ROS and mitochondrial staining, cell proliferation and cell cycle assays. Furthermore, gene and protein expression analysis were performed in H2O2-challenged versus control group 24 hr post-treatment using qRT-PCR and immune blotting or immunocytochemistry assay, respectively. Moreover, exosomes were isolated from spent media using ultracentrifugation procedure, and subsequently used for RNA isolation and qRT-PCR. In the second experiment, exosomes released by granulosa cells under oxidative stress (StressExo) or those released by granulosa cells without oxidative stress (NormalExo) were co-incubated with bovine granulosa cells in vitro to proof the potential horizontal transfer of defense molecules from exosomes to granulosa cells and investigate any phenotype changes. Exposure of bovine granulosa cells to H2O2 induced the accumulation of ROS, reduced mitochondrial activity, increased expression of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant genes (both mRNA and protein), altered the cell cycle transitions and induced cellular apoptosis. Granulosa cells exposed to oxidative stress released exosomes enriched with mRNA of Nrf2 and candidate antioxidants. Subsequent co-incubation of StressExo with cultured granulosa cells could alter the relative abundance of cellular oxidative stress response molecules including Nrf2 and antioxidants CAT, PRDX1 and TXN1. The present study provide evidences that granulosa cells exposed to oxidative stress conditions react to stress by activating cascades of cellular antioxidant molecules which can also be released into extracellular environment through exosomes.

Int J Mol Sci	2017	Myogenic differentiation is triggered, among other situations, in response to muscle damage for regenerative purposes. It has been shown that during myogenic differentiation, myotubes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) which participate in the signalling pattern of the microenvironment. Here we investigated whether EVs released by myotubes exposed or not to mild oxidative stress modulate the behaviour of targeted differentiating myoblasts and macrophages to promote myogenesis. We found that EVs released by oxidatively challenged myotubes (H₂O₂-EVs) are characterized by an increased loading of nucleic acids, mainly DNA. In addition, incubation of myoblasts with H₂O₂-EVs resulted in a significant decrease of myotube diameter, myogenin mRNA levels and myosin heavy chain expression along with an upregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen: these effects collectively lead to an increase of recipient myoblast proliferation. Notably, the EVs from untreated myotubes induced an opposite trend in myoblasts, that is, a slight pro-differentiation effect. Finally, H₂O₂-EVs were capable of eliciting an increased interleukin 6 mRNA expression in RAW264.7 macrophages. Notably, this is the first demonstration that myotubes communicate with surrounding macrophages via EV release. Collectively, the data reported herein suggest that myotubes, depending on their conditions, release EVs carrying differential signals which could contribute to finely and coherently orchestrate the muscle regeneration process.

Exosomal TGF-β1 is correlated with lymphatic metastasis of gastric cancers.	Am J Cancer Res	2017	Exosomes are nano-vesicles transporting bioactive material between cells. This study explored the prognostic association of exosomal TGF-β1 with lymph node (LN) metastasis of gastric cancer (GC). TGF-β1 expressions in the exosomes isolated from the gastroepiploic veins of 61 GC patients analyzed by ELISA. The regulatory T (Treg) cells in celiac LNs of gastric cancer analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Exosomal TGF-β1 expression and the ratio of Treg cells in draining LNs were both significantly associated with pathological stages and LN metastasis of gastric cancer. Besides, the exosomal TGF-β1 expression and Treg proportion in LN were also significantly correlated in gastric cancer patients. Recombinant TGF-β1 and exosomes isolated from GC patients were used to induce FOXP3+ Treg cells from naïve T cells in vitro. Compared to the control, recombinant TGF-β1 induced more CD25 (41%), FOXP3 (19%) and CTLA-4 (47%), while reduced CD45RA expression by 38% in primary naïve T cell cultures (p<0.01). Exosomes treatment induced more CD25 and 45% higher CTLA-4 expression, and increased 29% higher of CD45RA-negative cells than recombinant TGF-β1 did (p<0.01). Adding TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody partially abrogated the effects of exosomes on Treg induction. Our study showed exosomal TGF-β1 related to lymph node metastasis and the ratio of Treg cells in lymph nodes of gastric cancers. Exosomes from gastric cancer patients could induce Treg cells formation through the effect of TGF-β1.	PMC5714749

Extracellular Vesicles from Hypoxic Adipocytes and Obese Subjects Reduce Insulin-Stimulated Glucose Uptake.	Mol Nutr Food Res	2018	SCOPE: We investigate the effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs) obtained from in vitro adipocyte cell models and from obese subjects on glucose transport and insulin responsiveness. METHODS AND RESULTS: EVs are isolated from the culture supernatant of adipocytes cultured under normoxia, hypoxia (1% oxygen), or exposed to macrophage conditioned media (15% v/v). EVs are isolated from the plasma of lean individuals and subjects with obesity. Cultured adipocytes are incubated with EVs and activation of insulin signalling cascades and insulin-stimulated glucose transport are measured. EVs released from hypoxic adipocytes impair insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake and reduce insulin mediated phosphorylation of AKT. Insulin-mediated phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinases (ERK1/2) is not affected. EVs from individuals with obesity decrease insulin stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in adipocytes (p = 0.0159). CONCLUSION: EVs released by stressed adipocytes impair insulin action in neighboring adipocytes.	PMC5887919

Cell	2018	The neuronal gene Arc is essential for long-lasting information storage in the mammalian brain, mediates various forms of synaptic plasticity, and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, little is known about Arc's molecular function and evolutionary origins. Here, we show that Arc self-assembles into virus-like capsids that encapsulate RNA. Endogenous Arc protein is released from neurons in extracellular vesicles that mediate the transfer of Arc mRNA into new target cells, where it can undergo activity-dependent translation. Purified Arc capsids are endocytosed and are able to transfer Arc mRNA into the cytoplasm of neurons. These results show that Arc exhibits similar molecular properties to retroviral Gag proteins. Evolutionary analysis indicates that Arc is derived from a vertebrate lineage of Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons, which are also ancestors to retroviruses. These findings suggest that Gag retroelements have been repurposed during evolution to mediate intercellular communication in the nervous system.	PMC5884693

Comparative Proteomic Analysis of Exosomes and Microvesicles in Human Saliva for Lung Cancer.	J Proteome Res	2018	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived microparticles present in most body fluids, mainly including microvesicles and exosomes.

We successfully isolated microvesicles and exosomes from human saliva, which were further characterized comprehensively. Salivary EV protein profiling in normal subjects and lung cancer patients was systematically compared through utilizing LC-MS/MS-based label-free quantification. 785 and 910 proteins were identified from salivary exosomes and microvesicles, respectively. According to statistical analysis, 150 and 243 proteins were revealed as dysregulated candidates in exosomes and microvesicles for lung cancer. Among them, 25 and 40 proteins originally from distal organ cells were found in the salivary exosomes and microvesicles of lung cancer patients. In particular, 5 out of 25 and 9 out of 40 are lung-related proteins. Six potential candidates were selected for verification by Western blot, and four of them, namely, BPIFA1, CRNN, MUC5B, and IQGAP, were confirmed either in salivary microvesicles or in exosomes. Our data collectively demonstrate that salivary EVs harbor informative proteins that might be used for the detection of lung cancer through a noninvasive way.

C-Terminal Farnesylation of UCH-L1 Plays a Role in Transport of Epstein-Barr Virus Primary Oncoprotein LMP1 to Exosomes.	mSphere	2018 Jan-Feb	Increasing evidence shows that exosomes are key regulators in cancer cell-to-cell communication. Several reports on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related malignancies demonstrate that latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) secreted by exosomes derived from EBV- or LMP1-positive cells can promote cancer progression and metastasis. However, the mechanism by which LMP1 is loaded into exosomes is still poorly understood. Here, we examined whether the process of LMP1 loading into exosomes is linked to the multifunctional molecule of the ubiquitin system-ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1). For the first time, we demonstrate that LMP1 is physically associated with UCH-L1 and that directing of LMP1 to exosomes is mediated by C-terminal farnesylation of UCH-L1. Additionally, we found that the FTI-277 farnesyltransferase inhibitor reduces motility- and anchorage-independent growth of EBV-positive cells in functional assays. On the basis of our results, we conclude that C-terminal farnesylation of UCH-L1 is one of the key mechanisms by which LMP1 is sorted to exosomes. We hypothesize that inhibition of farnesylation with specific small-molecule inhibitors blocks exosome-mediated transfer of prometastatic molecules such as LMP1 during cancer cell-to-cell communications and thereby impedes the process of cancer invasion. IMPORTANCE Exosomes are small vesicles that cells secrete into the extracellular space, and there is increasing evidence that they have pivotal roles in cell-to-cell communication in malignancy. It is reported also that EBV-associated malignant cells, including those derived from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and B-cell lymphoma, secrete exosomes. These EBV-related exosomes may contain viral products such as latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and may contribute to cancer progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which those viral products are loaded in exosomes. In this study, we show for the first time that ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) and its C-terminal farnesylation, a posttranslational lipid modification, contribute to this mechanism. Our results also suggest that inhibition of UCH-L1 farnesylation is a potential therapeutic target against cancer metastasis and invasion.	PMC5806207

A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10-containing exosomes derived from nasal polyps promote angiogenesis and vascular permeability.	Mol Med Rep	2018	Abnormal angiogenesis and vascular permeability is important for the formation of nasal polyps (NPs). Increasing evidence has indicated that exosomes serve a vital role in modulating angiogenesis and vascular permeability. A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10), an important type of proteinase that is overexpressed in various diseases, can influence angiogenesis and vascular permeability and has been observed in healthy nasal exosomes. To the best of our knowledge, the expression levels and the function of ADAM10 in NLF‑derived exosomes from NPs has not been demonstrated previously. In order to determine the influence of exosomes derived from nasal lavage fluid (NLF) on angiogenesis and vascular permeability, 25 nasal polyp patients and 15 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the present study. NLF was collected from all of the subjects. Exosomes were isolated from NLF, visualized under transmission electron microscope and identified using western blot analysis. The effect of exosomes on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was measured by tube formation and permeability assays in vitro. The expression of exosomal ADAM10 was also analyzed by western blotting. NLF‑derived exosomes from NPs influenced proliferation, tube formation and the permeability of HUVECs. ADAM10 was highly expressed in NLF‑derived exosomes from NPs when compared with healthy volunteers. Thus, NLF‑derived exosomes from NPs promoted angiogenesis and vascular permeability, which may be associated with abundant ADAM10 in NP exosomes.	PMC5866038

Mol Ther	2018	miRNAs are potent tools that in principle can be used to control the replication of infectious agents. The objectives of the studies reported here were to design miRNAs that can block the replication of herpes simplex virus 1 and which could be delivered to infected cells via exosomes. We report the following: (1) We designed three miRNAs targeting the mRNA encoding ICP4, an essential viral regulatory protein. Of the three miRNAs, one miRNA401 effectively blocked ICP4 accumulation and viral replication on transfection into susceptible cells. (2) To facilitate packaging of the miRNA into exosomes, we incorporated into the sequence of miRNA401 an exosome-packaging motif. miRNA401 was shown to be packaged into exosomes and successfully delivered by exosomes to susceptible cells, where it remained stable for at least 72 hr. Finally, the results show that miRNA401 delivered to cells via exosomes effectively reduced virus yields in a miRNA401 dose-dependent fashion. The protocol described in this report can be applied to study viral gene functions without actually deleting or mutagenizing the gene.

Viral miRNAs Alter Host Cell miRNA Profiles and Modulate Innate Immune Responses.	Front Immunol	2018	Prevalence of the members of herpesvirus family in oral inflammatory diseases is increasingly acknowledged suggesting their likely role as an etiological factor. However, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. In our recent miRNA profiling of healthy and diseased human tooth pulps, elevated expression of human herpesvirus encoded viral microRNAs (v-miRs) were identified. Based on the fold induction and significance values, we selected three v-miRs namely miR-K12-3-3p [Kaposi sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV)], miR-H1 [herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1)], and miR-UL-70-3p [human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)] to further examine their impact on host cellular functions. We examined their impact on cellular miRNA profiles of primary human oral keratinocytes (HOK). Our results show differential expression of several host miRNAs in v-miR-transfected HOK. High levels of v-miRs were detected in exosomes derived from v-miR transfected HOK as well as the KSHV-infected cell lines. We show that HOK-derived exosomes release their contents into macrophages (Mφ) and alter expression of endogenous miRNAs. Concurrent expression analysis of precursor (pre)-miRNA and mature miRNA suggest transcriptional or posttranscriptional impact of v-miRs on the cellular miRNAs. Employing bioinformatics, we predicted several pathways targeted by deregulated cellular miRNAs that include cytoskeletal organization, endocytosis, and cellular signaling. We validated three novel targets of miR-K12-3-3p and miR-H1 that are involved in endocytic and intracellular trafficking pathways. To evaluate the functional consequence of this regulation, we performed phagocytic uptake of labeled bacteria and noticed significant attenuation in miR-H1 and miR-K12-3-3p but not miR-UL70-3p transfected primary human Mφ. Multiple cytokine analysis of E. coli challenged Mφ revealed marked reduction of secreted cytokine levels with important roles in innate and adaptive immune responses suggesting a role of v-miRs in immune subversion. Our findings reveal that oral disease associated v-miRs can dysregulate functions of key host cells that shape oral mucosal immunity thus exacerbating disease severity and progression.	PMC5845630

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2018	Exosomal microRNAs(miRNAs) transfer from tumor to stromal cells is reportedly associated with cancer progression and metastasis in various epithelial cancers. However, the role of exosomal miRNA in the metastasis of osteosarcoma(OS) -the most common bone malignancy-still largely remains unknown. In this study, we purified exosomes with a median size close to 100 nm from cell culture media as well as patient serum, and proved that exosomes derived from the metastatic, but not the non-metastatic OS cells increase the migration and invasion of non-malignant fibroblast cells (hFOB1.19) in vitro. Furthermore, the differential miRNA cargo between metastatic and non-metastatic OS is identified by small RNA sequencing and RT-PCR validation, we found a highly expression of exosomal, but not cellular miR-675 level in the metastatic OS cell-lines compared with non-metastatic counterparts. Meanwhile, we also found that exosomal miR-675 could down-regulate CALN1 expression in recipient cell, which may influence the invasion and migration of hFOB1.19. Finally, the up regulation serum exosomal miR-675 and down regulation of CALN1 in tumor specimen was also found to be associated with the metastatic phenotype in OS patients. Our findings indicate that the exosomal miR-675 is a gene associated with OS and serum exosomal miR-675 expression may serve as a novel biomarker for the metastasis of OS.

Cell Death Dis	2018	Intercellular communication between malignant cells and neighboring nonmalignant cells is involved in carcinogenesis. In the progression of carcinogenesis, exosomes are messengers for intercellular communication. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are noncoding RNAs with functions that include regulation of the cell cycle and proliferation. However, the functions of exosomal circRNAs are not clear. The present research aimed to determine whether circRNAs secreted from arsenite-transformed human hepatic epithelial (L-02) cells are transferred into normal L-02 cells and become functionally active in the normal cells. The results showed that circRNA_100284 is involved in the malignant transformation of L-02 cells induced by arsenite. The medium from transformed L-02 cells induced upregulation of circRNA_100284, accelerated the cell cycle, and promoted proliferation of normal L-02 cells. Transformed cells transferred circRNA_100284 into normal L-02 cells via exosomes and led to the malignant transformation of the non-transformed cells. Knockdown of circRNA_100284, which reduced circRNA_100284 levels in exosomes derived from transformed L-02 cells, blocked the accelerated cell cycle and reduced proliferation and malignancy. In addition, in normal L-02 cells, exosomal circRNA_100284 derived from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells induced acceleration of the cell cycle and promoted proliferation via acting as a sponge of microRNA-217. Further, exosomal circRNA_100284 was upregulated in the sera of people exposed to arsenite. Thus, exosomes derived from transformed L-02 cells transferred circRNA_100284 to surrounding cells, which induced an accelerated cell cycle and promoted proliferation of normal liver cells and led to the malignant transformation of the non-transformed cells. The findings support the concept that exosomal circRNAs are involved in cell-cell communication during carcinogenesis induced by arsenite.

Glypican-1 is enriched in circulating-exosomes in pancreatic cancer and correlates with tumor burden.	Oncotarget	2018	Background: Glypican-1 (GPC1) is expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells and adjacent stromal fibroblasts. Recently, GPC1 circulating exosomes (crExos) have been shown to be able to detect early stages of PDAC. In this study, we investigated the usefulness of crExos GPC1 as a biomarker for PDAC. Methods: Plasma was obtained from patients with benign pancreatic disease (n = 16) and PDAC (n = 27) prior to pancreatectomy, and crExos were isolated by ultra-centrifugation. Protein was extracted from surgical specimens (adjacent normal pancreas, n = 13; and PDAC, n = 17). GPC1 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: There was no significant difference in GPC1 levels between normal pancreas and PDAC tissues. This was also true when comparing matched pairs. However, GPC1 levels were enriched in PDAC crExos (n = 11), compared to the source tumors (n = 11; 97 ± 54 vs. 20.9 ± 12.3 pg/mL; P < 0.001). In addition, PDACs with high GPC1 expression tended to have crExos with higher GPC1 levels. Despite these findings, we were unable to distinguish PDAC from benign pancreatic disease using crExos GPC1 levels. Interestingly, we found that in matched pre and post-operative plasma samples there was a significant drop in crExos GPC1 levels after surgical resection for PDAC (n = 11 vs. 11; 97 ± 54 vs. 77.8 ± 32.4 pg/mL; P = 0.0428). Furthermore, we found that patients with high crExos GPC1 levels have significantly larger PDACs (>4 cm; P = 0.012). Conclusions: High GPC1 crExos may be able to determine PDAC tumor size and disease burden. However, further efforts are needed to elucidate its role as a diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker using larger cohorts of PDAC patients.	PMC5922373

J Neurooncol	2018	The malignant primary brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM) is generally incurable. New approaches are desperately needed. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated delivery of anti-tumor transgenes is a promising strategy, however direct injection leads to focal transgene spread in tumor and rapid tumor division dilutes out the extra-chromosomal AAV genome, limiting duration of transgene expression. Intravenous (IV) injection gives widespread distribution of AAV in normal brain, however poor transgene expression in tumor, and high expression in non-target cells which may lead to ineffective therapy and high toxicity, respectively. Delivery of transgenes encoding secreted, anti-tumor proteins to tumor stromal cells may provide a more stable and localized reservoir of therapy as they are more differentiated than fast-dividing tumor cells. Reactive astrocytes and tumor-associated macrophage/microglia (TAMs) are stromal cells that comprise a large portion of the tumor mass and are associated with tumorigenesis. In mouse models of GBM, we used IV delivery of exosome-associated AAV vectors driving green fluorescent protein expression by specific promoters (NF-κB-responsive promoter and a truncated glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter), to obtain targeted transduction of TAMs and reactive astrocytes, respectively, while avoiding transgene expression in the periphery. We used our approach to express the potent, yet toxic anti-tumor cytokine, interferon beta, in tumor stroma of a mouse model of GBM, and achieved a modest, yet significant enhancement in survival compared to controls. Noninvasive genetic modification of tumor microenvironment represents a promising approach for therapy against cancers. Additionally, the vectors described here may facilitate basic research in the study of tumor stromal cells in situ.

Eur J Immunol	2003	Exosomes are secreted nanometer-sized vesicles derived from antigen-presenting cells, which have attracted recent interest as they likely play important roles in immune regulation, and their use as cell-free tools for immunotherapy has been proposed. Liposomes used clinically as transport vehicles can activate the complement system, leading to their rapid degradation and significant inflammatory toxicity. The use of isolated exosomes in therapy, therefore, may also elicit complement activation, reducing their potential efficacy. We have examined the expression and functional roles of the membrane regulators of complement (CD46, CD55 and CD59) on antigen-presenting cell-derived exosomes. Exosomes express the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored regulators CD55 and CD59, but not the transmembrane protein CD46. Antibody blocking of CD55 in the presence of sensitizing antibody (w6/32) and human serum resulted in increased C3b deposition and significantly increased exosome lysis. Blockade of CD59 also resulted in significant lysis, while blocking both CD55 and CD59 increased lysis still further. We conclude that exosomes express GPI-anchored complement regulators in order to permit their survival in the extracellular environment.

Exosomes derived from IL-10-treated dendritic cells can suppress inflammation and collagen-induced arthritis.	J Immunol	2005	We have demonstrated previously that local, adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of viral IL-10 to a single joint of rabbits and mice with experimental arthritis can suppress disease in both the treated and untreated contralateral joints. This contralateral effect is mediated in part by APCs able to traffic from the treated joint to lymph nodes as well as to untreated joints. Moreover, injection of dendritic cells (DC) genetically modified to express IL-4 or Fas ligand was able to reverse established murine arthritis. To examine the ability of exosomes derived from immunosuppressive DCs to reduce inflammation and autoimmunity, murine models of delayed-type hypersensitivity and collagen-induced arthritis were used. In this study, we demonstrate that periarticular administration of exosomes purified from either bone marrow-derived DCs transduced ex vivo with an adenovirus expressing viral IL-10 or bone marrow-derived DCs treated with recombinant murine IL-10 were able to suppress delayed-type hypersensitivity responses within injected and untreated contralateral joints. In addition, the systemic injection of IL-10-treated DC-derived exosomes was able suppress the onset of murine collagen-induced arthritis as well as reduce severity of established arthritis. Taken together, these data suggest that immature DCs are able to secrete exosomes that are involved in the suppression of inflammatory and autoimmune responses. Thus DC-derived exosomes may represent a novel, cell-free therapy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

Am J Transplant	2006	Exosomes are MHC-bearing vesicles secreted by a wide array of cells. We have previously shown that donor-haplotype exosomes from bone marrow dendritic cells (DCs) injected before transplantation significantly prolong heart allograft survival in congenic and fully MHC-mismatched Lewis rats. Here we show that donor exosomes administered after transplantation are similarly able to prolong allograft survival, however, without inducing tolerance. We therefore tested the effect of exosomes combined with short-term LF 15-0195 (LF) treatment, which blocks the maturation of DCs, so that donor-MHC antigens from exosomes could be presented in a more tolerogenic environment. LF treatment does not preclude the development of a strong antidonor cellular response, and while LF, but not exosome, treatment inhibits the antidonor humoral response and decreases leukocyte graft infiltration, allografts from LF-treated recipients were either acutely or strongly chronically rejected. Interestingly, when combined with LF treatment, exosomes induced a donor-specific allograft tolerance characterized by a strong inhibition of the antidonor proliferative response. This donor-specific tolerance was transferable to naïve allograft recipients. Moreover, exosomes/LF treatment prevented or considerably delayed the appearance of chronic rejection. These results suggest that under LF treatment, presentation of donor-MHC antigens (from exosomes) can induce regulatory responses that are able to modulate allograft rejection and to induce donor-specific allograft tolerance.

Nonspecific CD4(+) T cells with uptake of antigen-specific dendritic cell-released exosomes stimulate antigen-specific CD8(+) CTL responses and long-term T cell memory.	J Leukoc Biol	2007	Dendritic cell (DC) and DC-derived exosomes (EXO) have been used extensively for tumor vaccination. However, its therapeutic efficiency is limited to only production of prophylactic immunity against tumors. T cells can uptake DC-released EXO. However, the functional effect of transferred exosomal molecules on T cells is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that OVA protein-pulsed DC-derived EXO (EXO(OVA)) can be taken up by Con A-stimulated, nonspecific CD4(+) T cells derived from wild-type C57BL/6 mice. The active EXO-uptaken CD4(+) T cells (aT(EXO)), expressing acquired exosomal MHC I/OVA I peptide (pMHC I) complexes and costimulatory CD40 and CD80 molecules, can act as APCs capable of stimulating OVA-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and inducing efficient CD4(+) Th cell-independent CD8(+) CTL responses in vivo. The EXO(OVA)-uptaken CD4(+) aT(EXO) cell vaccine induces much more efficient CD8(+) T cell responses and immunity against challenge of OVA-transfected BL6-10 melanoma cells expressing OVA in wild-type C57BL/6 mice than EXO(OVA). The in vivo stimulatory effect of the CD4(+) aT(EXO) cell to CD8(+) T cell responses is mediated and targeted by its CD40 ligand signaling/acquired exosomal CD80 and pMHC I complexes, respectively. In addition, CD4(+) aT(EXO) vaccine stimulates a long-term, OVA-specific CD8(+) T cell memory. Therefore, the EXO(OVA)-uptaken CD4(+) T cells may represent a new, effective, EXO-based vaccine strategy in induction of immune responses against tumors and other infectious diseases.

Immunology	2008	Oral tolerance is an active process that starts with sampling of luminal antigens by the intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), followed by processing and assembly with major histocompatibility complex class II and subsequently a release of tolerogenic exosomes (tolerosomes) from the IEC. We have previously shown that tolerosomes can be isolated from serum shortly after an antigen feed, and will potently transfer antigen-specific tolerance to naive recipients. Here we study the capacity of the tolerosomes to protect against allergic sensitization in a mouse model of allergic asthma. Serum or isolated serum exosomes from tolerized BALB/c donor mice were transferred to syngeneic recipients followed by sensitization and intranasal exposure to ovalbumin (OVA). Blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lymph nodes were sampled 24 hr after the final exposure. The number of eosinophils was counted in BAL fluid and the levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and OVA-specific IgE were measured in serum. Mediastinal and coeliac lymph nodes were analysed by flow cytometry. The animals receiving serum from OVA-fed mice displayed significantly lower numbers of airway eosinophils and lower serum levels of total IgE as well as of OVA-specific IgE compared with controls. Moreover, the tolerant animals showed a significantly higher frequency of activated T cells with a regulatory phenotype in both mediastinal and coeliac lymph nodes. The results show that serum or isolated serum exosomes obtained from OVA-fed mice and administered intraperitoneally to naive recipient mice abrogated allergic sensitization in the recipients.

FASEB J	2009	Brain tumors are horrific diseases with almost universally fatal outcomes; new therapeutics are desperately needed and will come from improved understandings of glioma biology. Exosomes are endosomally derived 30-100 nm membranous vesicles released from many cell types into the extracellular milieu; surprisingly, exosomes are virtually unstudied in neuro-oncology. These microvesicles were used as vaccines in other tumor settings, but their immunological significance is unevaluated in brain tumors. Our purpose here is to report the initial biochemical, proteomic, and immunological studies on murine brain tumor exosomes, following known procedures to isolate exosomes. Our findings show that these vesicles have biophysical characteristics and proteomic profiles similar to exosomes from other cell types but that brain tumor exosomes have unique features (e.g., very basic isoelectric points, expressing the mutated tumor antigen EGFRvIII and the putatively immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-beta). Administration of such exosomes into syngeneic animals produced both humoral and cellular immune responses in immunized hosts capable of rejecting subsequent tumor challenges but failed to prolong survival in established orthotopic models. Control animals received saline or cell lysate vaccines and showed no antitumor responses. Exosomes and microvesicles isolated from sera of patients with brain tumors also possess EGFR, EGFRvIII, and TGF-beta. We conclude that exosomes released from brain tumor cells are biochemically/biophysically like other exosomes and have immune-modulating properties. They can escape the blood-brain barrier, with potential systemic and distal signaling and immune consequences.	PMC2669426

Human placenta expresses and secretes NKG2D ligands via exosomes that down-modulate the cognate receptor expression: evidence for immunosuppressive function.	J Immunol	2009	During mammalian pregnancy maternal-fetal tolerance involves a number of immunosuppressive factors produced by placenta. Recently, placenta-derived exosomes have emerged as new immune regulators in the maternal immune tolerance. Exosomes are membrane nanovesicles with defined morphology, which are secreted from endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVB) upon fusion with the plasma membrane. Previously, we reported that the MHC class I chain-related (MIC) proteins A and B, human ligands of the activating NK cell receptor NKG2D, are expressed by placenta, sorted to MVB of syncytiotrophoblast and probably released via MIC-bearing exosomes. In this report, we show that the second family of human NKG2D ligands, the UL-16 binding proteins (ULBP), is also expressed by placenta. Importantly, this expression was not due to placental CMV infection. Immunoelectron microscopy disclosed that ULBP1-5 are produced and retained in MVB of the syncytiotrophoblast on microvesicles/exosomes. Using human placenta explant cultures and different assays, we demonstrate that exosomes bearing NKG2D ligands are released by human placenta. Isolated placental exosomes carried ULBP1-5 and MIC on their surface and induced down-regulation of the NKG2D receptor on NK, CD8(+), and gammadelta T cells, leading to reduction of their in vitro cytotoxicity without affecting the perforin-mediated lytic pathway. Release of placental NKG2D ligands via exosomes is an alternative mechanism for generation of bioactive soluble form of these ligands. These findings highlight a role for NKG2D ligand-bearing placental exosomes in the fetal immune escape and support the view of placenta as a unique immunosuppressive organ.

BMC Genomics	2010	BACKGROUND: Recent literature has revealed that genetic exchange of microRNA between cells can be essential for cell-cell communication, tissue-specificity and developmental processes. In stem cells, as in other cells, this can be accomplished through microvesicles or exosome mediated transfer. However, molecular profiles and functions of microRNAs within the cells and in their exosomes are poorly studied. Next generation sequencing technologies could provide a broad-spectrum of microRNAs and their expression and identify possible microRNA targets. In this work, we performed deep sequencing of microRNAs to understand the profile and expression of the microRNAs in microvesicles and intracellular environment of human embryonic stem cells derived mesenchymal stem cells (hES-MSC). We outline a workflow pertaining to visualizing, statistical analysis and interpreting deep sequencing data of known intracellular and extracellular microRNAs from hES-MSC). We utilized these results of which directed our attention towards establishing hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) as a downstream target of let-7 family of microRNAs. RESULTS: In our study, significant differences in expression profile of microRNAs were found in the intracellular and extracellular environment of hES-MSC. However, a high level of let-7 family of microRNAs is predominant in both intra- and extra- cellular samples of hES-MSC. Further results derived from visualization of our alignment data and network analysis showed that let-7 family microRNAs could affect the downstream target HNF4A, which is a known endodermal differentiation marker. The elevated presence of let-7 microRNA in both intracellular and extra cellular environment further suggests a possible intercellular signalling mechanism through microvesicles transfer. We suggest that let-7 family microRNAs might play a signalling role via such a mechanism amongst populations of stem cells in maintaining self renewal property by suppressing HNF4A expression. This is in line with recent paradigm where microRNAs regulate self-renewal and differentiation pathways of embryonic stem cells by forming an integral biological network with transcription factors. CONCLUSION: In summary, our study using a combination of alignment, statistical and network analysis tools to examine deep sequencing data of microRNAs in hES-MSC has led to a result that (i) identifies intracellular and exosome microRNA expression profiles of hES-MSC with a possible mechanism of miRNA mediated intercellular regulation by these cells and (ii) placed HNF4A within the cross roads of regulation by the let-7 family of microRNAs.

Apoptosis	2011	Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) and Heat shock proteins (HSPs) provide assistance in protecting cells from stresses of hypoxia, imbalanced pH, and altered metabolic and redox states commonly found in the microenvironmental mixture of tumor and nontumor cells. HSPs are upregulated, cell-surface displayed and released extracellularly in some types of tumors, a finding that until now was not shared by members of the IAP family. The IAP Survivin has been implicated in apoptosis inhibition and the regulation of mitosis in cancer cells. Survivin exists in a number of subcellular locations such as the mitochondria, cytoplasm, nucleus, and most recently, the extracellular space. Our previous work showing that extracellular survivin was able to enhance cellular proliferation, survival and tumor cell invasion provides evidence that Survivin might be secreted via an unidentified exocytotic pathway. In the present study, we describe for the first time the exosome-release of Survivin to the extracellular space both basally and after proton irradiation-induced stress. To examine whether exosomes contributed to Survivin release from cancer cells, exosomes were purified from HeLa cervical carcinoma cells and exosome quantity and Survivin content were determined. We demonstrate that although proton irradiation does not influence the exosomal secretory rate, the Survivin content of exosomes isolated from HeLa cells treated with a sublethal dose of proton irradiation (3 Gy) is significantly higher than control. These data identify a novel secretory pathway by which Survivin can be actively released from cells in both the basal and stress-induced state.	PMC3174681

Proteomics Clin Appl	2007	Oligodendrocytes synthesize the CNS myelin sheath by enwrapping axonal segments with elongations of their plasma membrane. Spatial and temporal control of membrane traffic is a prerequisite for proper myelin formation. The major myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) accumulates in late endosomal storage compartments and multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane results in the release of the intralumenal vesicles, termed exosomes, into the extracellular space. Here, we show that cultured oligodendrocytes secrete exosomes carrying major amounts of PLP and 2'3'-cyclic-nucleotide-phosphodiesterase (CNP). These exosomes migrated at the characteristic density of 1.10-1.14 g/mL in sucrose density gradients. Treatment of primary oligodendrocytes with the calcium-ionophore ionomycin markedly increased the release of PLP-containing exosomes, indicating that oligodendroglial exosome secretion is regulated by cytosolic calcium levels. A proteomic analysis of the exosomal fraction isolated by sucrose density centrifugation revealed in addition to PLP and CNP, myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) as constituents of oligodendroglial exosomes, together with a striking group of proteins with proposed functions in the relief of cell stress. Oligodendroglial exosome secretion may contribute to balanced production of myelin proteins and lipids, but in addition exosomes may embody a signaling moiety involved in glia-mediated trophic support to axons.

Prostate	2011	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Human metastatic prostate cancer cell growth can be inhibited by GnRH analogs but effects on virus-immortalized prostate cells have not been investigated. METHODS: Virus-immortalized prostate cells were stably transfected with rat GnRH receptor cDNA and levels of GnRH binding were correlated with GnRH effects on signaling, cell cycle, growth, exosome production, and apoptosis. RESULTS: High levels of cell surface GnRH receptor occurred in transfected papillomavirus-immortalized WPE-1-NB26 epithelial cells but not in non-tumourigenic RWPE-1, myoepithelial WPMY-1 cells, or SV40-immortalized PNT1A. Endogenous cell surface GnRH receptor was undetectable in non-transfected cells or cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC3, and DU145. GnRH receptor levels correlated with induction of inositol phosphates, elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) , cytoskeletal actin reorganization, modulation of ERK activation and cell growth-inhibition with GnRH agonists. Hoechst 33342 DNA staining-cell sorting indicated accumulation of cells in G2 following agonist treatment. Release of exosomes from transfected WPE-1-NB26 was unaffected by agonists, unlike induction observed in HEK293([SCL60]) cells. Increased PARP cleavage and apoptotic body production were undetectable during growth-inhibition in WPE-1-NB26 cells, contrasting with HEK293([SCL60]) . EGF receptor activation inhibited GnRH-induced ERK activation in WPE-1-NB26 but growth-inhibition was not rescued by EGF or PKC inhibitor Ro320432. Growth of cells expressing low levels of GnRH receptor was not affected by agonists. CONCLUSIONS: Engineered high-level GnRH receptor activation inhibits growth of a subset of papillomavirus-immortalized prostate cells. Elucidating mechanisms leading to clone-specific differences in cell surface GnRH receptor levels is a valuable next step in developing strategies to exploit prostate cell anti-proliferation using GnRH agonists.

Detachment of breast tumor cells induces rapid secretion of exosomes which subsequently mediate cellular adhesion and spreading.	PLoS One	2011	Exosomes are nano-vesicles secreted by a wide range of mammalian cell types. These vesicles are abundant in serum and other extracellular fluids and contain a large repertoire of proteins, mRNA and microRNA. Exosomes have been implicated in cell to cell communication, the transfer of infectious agents, and neurodegenerative diseases as well as tumor progression. However, the precise mechanisms by which they are internalized and/or secreted remain poorly understood. In order to follow their release and uptake in breast tumor cells in real time, cell-derived exosomes were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CD63 while human serum exosomes were rhodamine isothiocynate-labeled. We show that detachment of adherent cells from various substrata induces a rapid and substantial secretion of exosomes, which then concentrate on the cell surfaces and mediate adhesion to various extracellular matrix proteins. We also demonstrate that disruption of lipid rafts with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MβCD) inhibits the internalization of exosomes and that annexins are essential for the exosomal uptake mechanisms. Taken together, these data suggest that cellular detachment is accompanied by significant release of exosomes while cellular adhesion and spreading are enhanced by rapid uptake and disposition of exosomes on the cell surface.

Microvesicle-associated AAV vector as a novel gene delivery system.	Mol Ther	2012	Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have shown remarkable efficiency for gene delivery to cultured cells and in animal models of human disease. However, limitations to AAV vectored gene transfer exist after intravenous transfer, including off-target gene delivery (e.g., liver) and low transduction of target tissue. Here, we show that during production, a fraction of AAV vectors are associated with microvesicles/exosomes, termed vexosomes (vector-exosomes). AAV capsids associated with the surface and in the interior of microvesicles were visualized using electron microscopy. In cultured cells, vexosomes outperformed conventionally purified AAV vectors in transduction efficiency. We found that purified vexosomes were more resistant to a neutralizing anti-AAV antibody compared to conventionally purified AAV. Finally, we show that vexosomes bound to magnetic beads can be attracted to a magnetized area in cultured cells. Vexosomes represent a unique entity which offers a promising strategy to improve gene delivery.	PMC3345986

Plasma-derived MHC class II+ exosomes from tumor-bearing mice suppress tumor antigen-specific immune responses.	Eur J Immunol	2012	Tumor-specific immunosuppression is frequently observed in tumor-bearing hosts. Exosomes are nano-sized, endosomal-derived membrane vesicles secreted by most tumor and hematopoietic cells and have been shown to actively participate in immune regulation. We previously demonstrated that antigen-specific immunosuppressive exosomes could be isolated from the blood plasma of antigen-immunized mice. Here, we demonstrate that plasma-derived exosomes isolated from mice bearing OVA-expressing tumors were able to suppress OVA-specific immune responses in a mouse delayed-type hypersensitivity model. Enrichment of tumor-derived exosomes in the plasma of mice bearing subcutaneous melanoma was not detected using an exosome-tagging approach. Instead, depletion of MHC class II(+) vesicles from plasma-derived exosomes or using plasma-derived exosomes isolated from MHC class II-deficient mice resulted in significant abrogation of the suppressive effect. These results demonstrate that circulating host-derived, MHC class II(+) exosomes in tumor-bearing hosts are able to suppress the immune response specific to tumor antigens.	PMC3471134

J Immunol	2012	Exosomes are nanovesicles released by normal and tumor cells, which are detectable in cell culture supernatant and human biological fluids, such as plasma. Functions of exosomes released by "normal" cells are not well understood. In fact, several studies have been carried out on exosomes derived from hematopoietic cells, but very little is known about NK cell exosomes, despite the importance of these cells in innate and adaptive immunity. In this paper, we report that resting and activated NK cells, freshly isolated from blood of healthy donors, release exosomes expressing typical protein markers of NK cells and containing killer proteins (i.e., Fas ligand and perforin molecules). These nanovesicles display cytotoxic activity against several tumor cell lines and activated, but not resting, immune cells. We also show that NK-derived exosomes undergo uptake by tumor target cells but not by resting PBMC. Exosomes purified from plasma of healthy donors express NK cell markers, including CD56+ and perforin, and exert cytotoxic activity against different human tumor target cells and activated immune cells as well. The results of this study propose an important role of NK cell-derived exosomes in immune surveillance and homeostasis. Moreover, this study supports the use of exosomes as an almost perfect example of biomimetic nanovesicles possibly useful in future therapeutic approaches against various diseases, including tumors.

Macrophage microvesicles induce macrophage differentiation and miR-223 transfer.	Blood	2013	Microvesicles are small membrane-bound particles comprised of exosomes and various-sized extracellular vesicles. These are released by several cell types. Microvesicles have a variety of cellular functions from communication to mediating growth and differentiation. Microvesicles contain proteins and nucleic acids. Previously, we showed that plasma microvesicles contain microRNAs (miRNAs). Based on our previous report, the majority of peripheral blood microvesicles are derived from platelets, while mononuclear phagocytes, including macrophages, are the second most abundant population. Here, we characterized macrophage-derived microvesicles and explored their role in the differentiation of naive monocytes. We also identified the miRNA content of the macrophage-derived microvesicles. We found that RNA molecules contained in the macrophage-derived microvesicles were transported to target cells, including mono cytes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. Furthermore, we found that miR-223 was transported to target cells and was functionally active. Based on our observations, we hypothesize that microvesicles bind to and activate target cells. Furthermore, we find that microvesicles induce the differentiation of macrophages. Thus, defining key components of this response may identify novel targets to regulate host defense and inflammation.

Exosomes from triple-negative breast cancer cells can transfer phenotypic traits representing their cells of origin to secondary cells.	Eur J Cancer	2013	BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15-20% of breast cancers but is responsible for a disproportionate number of deaths. We investigated the relevance, in TNBC, of nano-sized exosomes expelled from cells. Specifically, we compared effects of exosomes derived from the claudin-low TNBC cell line Hs578T and its more invasive Hs578Ts(i)8 variant, as well as exosomes from TNBC patient sera compared to normal sera. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media (CM) of Hs578T and Hs578Ts(i)8 cells and from sera by filtration and ultracentrifugation. Successful isolation was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and immunoblotting. Subsequent analysis, of secondary/recipient cells in response to exosomes, included proliferation; motility/migration; invasion; anoikis assays and endothelial tubule formation assays. RESULTS: Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes versus Hs578T-exosomes significantly increased the proliferation, migration and invasion capacity of all three recipient cell lines evaluated i.e. SKBR3, MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954. Exosomes from Hs578Ts(i)8 cells also conferred increased invasiveness to parent Hs578T cells. Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes increased sensitivity of SKBR3, MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954 to anoikis when compared to the effects of Hs578T-exosomes reflecting the fact that Hs578Ts(i)8 cells are themselves innately more sensitive to anoikis. In relation to vasculogenesis and subsequent angiogenesis, Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes versus Hs578T-exosomes stimulated significantly more endothelial tubules formation. Finally, our pilot translational study showed that exosomes from TNBC patients' sera significantly increased recipient cells' invasion when compared to those derived from age- and gender-matched healthy control sera. CONCLUSION: This study supports the hypothesis that TNBC exosomes may be involved in cancer cell-to-cell communication, conferring phenotypic traits to secondary cells that reflect those of their cells of origin.

Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	2013	AIM: To study anti-tumor effects of exosomes from class II transactivator (CIITA) gene transfected CT26 cells. METHODS: In this study, we established an MHC class II molecule-expressing murine colon cancer cell line (CT26-CIITA) by transduction of the CIITA gene. Immune effects in vitro and tumor protective results in vivo were tested and monitored. RESULTS: Exosomes from CT26-CIITA cells were found to contain a high level of MHC class II protein. When loaded on dendritic cells (DCs), exosomes from CT26-CIITA cells significantly increased expression of MHC class II molecules, CD86 and CD80, as compared to exosomes from CT26 cells. In vitro assays using co-culture of immunized splenocytes and exosome-loaded DCs demonstrated that CIITA- Exo enhanced splenocyte proliferation and IFN-γ production of CD4+T cells, while inhibiting IL-10 secretion. In addition, compared to exosomes from CT26 cells, CT26-CIITA-derived exosomes induced higher TNF-α and IL-12 mRNA levels. A mouse tumour preventive model showed that CT26-CIITA derived exosomes significantly inhibited tumour growth in a dose-dependent manner and significantly prolonged the survival time of tumour- bearing mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that CT26-CIITA-released exosomes are more efficient to induce anti-tumour immune responses, suggesting a potential role of MHC class II-containing tumour exosomes as cancer vaccine candidates.

Extracellular circulating viral microRNAs: current knowledge and perspectives.	Front Genet	2013	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs responsible of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression through interaction with messenger RNAs (mRNAs). They are involved in important biological processes and are often dysregulated in a variety of diseases, including cancer and infections. Viruses also encode their own sets of miRNAs, which they use to control the expression of either the host's genes and/or their own. In the past few years evidence of the presence of cellular miRNAs in extracellular human body fluids such as serum, plasma, saliva, and urine has accumulated. They have been found either cofractionate with the Argonaute2 protein or in membrane-bound vesicles such as exosomes. Although little is known about the role of circulating miRNAs, it has been demonstrated that miRNAs secreted by virus-infected cells are transferred to and act in uninfected recipient cells. In this work we summarize the current knowledge on viral circulating miRNAs and provide a few examples of computational prediction of their function.	PMC3690336

Using information theory to assess the communicative capacity of circulating microRNA.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2013	The discovery of extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) and their transport modalities (i.e., microparticles, exosomes, proteins and lipoproteins) has sparked theories regarding their role in intercellular communication. Here, we assessed the information transfer capacity of different miRNA transport modalities in human serum by utilizing basic principles of information theory. Zipf Statistics were calculated for each of the miRNA transport modalities identified in human serum. Our analyses revealed that miRNA-mediated information transfer is redundant, as evidenced by negative Zipf's Statistics with magnitudes greater than one. In healthy subjects, the potential communicative capacity of miRNA in complex with circulating proteins was significantly lower than that of miRNA encapsulated in circulating microparticles and exosomes. Moreover, the presence of coronary heart disease significantly lowered the communicative capacity of all circulating miRNA transport modalities. To assess the internal organization of circulating miRNA signals, Shannon's zero- and first-order entropies were calculated. Microparticles (MPs) exhibited the lowest Shannon entropic slope, indicating a relatively high capacity for information transfer. Furthermore, compared to the other miRNA transport modalities, MPs appeared to be the most efficient at transferring miRNA to cultured endothelial cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that although all transport modalities have the capacity for miRNA-based information transfer, MPs may be the simplest and most robust way to achieve miRNA-based signal transduction in sera. This study presents a novel method for analyzing the quantitative capacity of miRNA-mediated information transfer while providing insight into the communicative characteristics of distinct circulating miRNA transport modalities.

J Immunol	2013	Soluble CD23 plays a role in the positive regulation of an IgE response. Engagement of the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) on a B cell is known to enhance the level of both soluble CD23 and IgE, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not completely understood. In this study, we report that, in comparison with a CD40 ligand/IL-4-primed murine B cell alone, β2AR engagement on a primed B cell increased gene expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)10, which is the primary sheddase of CD23, as well as protein expression of both CD23 and ADAM10, in a protein kinase A- and p38 MAPK-dependent manner, and promoted the localization of these proteins to exosomes as early as 2 d after priming, as determined by both Western blot and flow cytometry and confirmed by electron microscopy. In comparison with isolated exosomes released from primed B cells alone, the transfer of exosomes released from β2AR agonist-exposed primed B cells to cultures of recipient primed B cells resulted in an increase in the level of IgE produced per cell, without affecting the number of cells producing IgE, as determined by ELISPOT. These effects still occurred when a β2AR antagonist was added along with the transfer to block residual agonist, and they failed to occur when exosomes were isolated from β2AR-deficient B cells. These findings suggest that the mechanism responsible for mediating the β2AR-induced increase in IgE involves a shuttling of the β2AR-induced increase in CD23 and ADAM10 proteins to exosomes that subsequently mediate an increase in IgE.

24335232	Philip J Norris	Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, CA;			Exosomes from red blood cell units bind to monocytes and induce proinflammatory cytokines, boosting T-cell responses in vitro.	Blood	2014	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small, double membrane vesicles derived from leukocytes, platelets, and cells of other tissues under physiological or pathological conditions. Generation of EVs in stored blood is thought to be associated with adverse effects and potentially immunosuppression in blood transfusion recipients. We measured the quantity and cells of origin for EVs isolated from stored red blood cell (RBC) units and tested whether they had any effects on T-cell-mediated immune responses. Mixing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with EVs resulted in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased survival of unstimulated PBMCs. EVs augmented mitogen-induced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell proliferation in an antigen-presenting cell (APC)-dependent manner. We demonstrated that EVs interacted primarily with monocytes and induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion. We also showed that the exosome fraction of EVs and not larger microvesicles was responsible for induction of TNF-α production by monocytes. Furthermore, blockade of CD40 or CD40L accessory molecules largely neutralized the EV augmentation of T-cell responses, implying a role for cell-cell interaction between T cells and EV-activated monocytes. Contrary to our hypothesis, the data demonstrate that EVs isolated from RBC units increase the potency of APCs and boost mitogen-driven T-cell proliferative responses.	PMC3907755

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2014	Molecular communication between cancer cells and its stromal microenvironment is a key factor for cancer progression. Alongside classic secretory pathways, it has recently been proposed that small membranous vesicles are alternative mediators of intercellular communication. Exosomes carry an effector-rich proteome with the ability to modulate various functional properties of the recipient cell. In this study, exosomes isolated from four epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR3, OVCAR433, OVCAR5 and SKOV3) were characterized using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Using an optimized workflow consisting of efficient exosome solubilization and the latest generation of proteomic instrumentation, we demonstrate improved detection depth. Systematic comparison of our cancer cell line exosome proteome against public data (Exocarta) and the recently published NCI 60 proteome revealed enrichment of functional categories related to signaling biology and biomarker discovery.

RRP6 from Trypanosoma brucei: crystal structure of the catalytic domain, association with EAP3 and activity towards structured and non-structured RNA substrates.	PLoS One	2014	RRP6 is a 3'-5' exoribonuclease associated to the eukaryotic exosome, a multiprotein complex essential for various RNA processing and degradation pathways. In Trypanosoma brucei, RRP6 associates with the exosome in stoichiometric amounts and was localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus, in contrast to yeast Rrp6 which is exclusively nuclear. Here we report the biochemical and structural characterization of T. brucei RRP6 (TbRRP6) and its interaction with the so-called T. brucei Exosome Associated Protein 3 (TbEAP3), a potential orthologue of the yeast Rrp6 interacting protein, Rrp47. Recombinant TbEAP3 is a thermo stable homodimer in solution, however it forms a heterodimeric complex with TbRRP6 with 1∶1 stoichiometry. The crystallographic structure of the TbRRP6 catalytic core exposes for the first time the native catalytic site of this RNase and also reveals a disulfide bond linking two helices of the HRDC domain. RNA degradation assays show the distributive exoribonuclease activity of TbRRP6 and novel findings regarding the structural range of its RNA substrates. TbRRP6 was able to degrade single and double-stranded RNAs and also RNA substrates containing stem-loops including those with 3' stem-loop lacking single-stranded extensions. Finally, association with TbEAP3 did not significantly interfere with the TbRRP6 catalytic activity in vitro.	PMC3928423

Oncol Lett	2014	Emerging evidence indicates that cancer-derived exosomes contribute to angiogenesis, tumor immunology and invasion. However, whether cancer cell-derived exosomes regulate the migration and invasion of the cancer cell itself, and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, exosomes derived from the 786-0 human renal cancer cell line were isolated, purified and 100 μg/ml were co-cultured with 786-0 cells for 24 h. The 786-0 cells were harvested for a cell invasion and migration assay. The expression of chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the 786-0 cells was examined by western blot analysis and revealed that the migration and invasion capabilities of the 786-0 cells were increased, however, the cell adhesion abilities were decreased as a result of the 24-h treatment with 786-0-derived exosomes. Furthermore, the expression levels of CXCR4 and MMP-9 in the 786-0 cells were increased. In conclusion, the 786-0 renal cancer cell line-derived exosomes increased migration and invasion, however, they decreased the adhesion ability of the 786-0 cells. The exosomes may have increased the CXCR4 and MMP-9 expression levels in the 786-0 cells. These findings indicated that renal tumor-derived exosomes may contribute to renal cancer development and progression.	PMC3997692

Electronic address: .	droberts@helix.nih.gov		CD47-dependent immunomodulatory and angiogenic activities of extracellular vesicles produced by T cells.	Matrix Biol	2014	Intercellular communication is critical for integrating complex signals in multicellular eukaryotes. Vascular endothelial cells and T lymphocytes closely interact during the recirculation and trans-endothelial migration of T cells. In addition to direct cell-cell contact, we show that T cell derived extracellular vesicles can interact with endothelial cells and modulate their cellular functions. Thrombospondin-1 and its receptor CD47 are expressed on exosomes/ectosomes derived from T cells, and these extracellular vesicles are internalized and modulate signaling in both T cells and endothelial cells. Extracellular vesicles released from cells expressing or lacking CD47 differentially regulate activation of T cells induced by engaging the T cell receptor. Similarly, T cell-derived extracellular vesicles modulate endothelial cell responses to vascular endothelial growth factor and tube formation in a CD47-dependent manner. Uptake of T cell derived extracellular vesicles by recipient endothelial cells globally alters gene expression in a CD47-dependent manner. CD47 also regulates the mRNA content of extracellular vesicles in a manner consistent with some of the resulting alterations in target endothelial cell gene expression. Therefore, the thrombospondin-1 receptor CD47 directly or indirectly regulates intercellular communication mediated by the transfer of extracellular vesicles between vascular cells.

J Gen Virol	2014	Our previous studies indicated that hepatitis E virus (HEV) forms membrane-associated particles in the cytoplasm, most likely by budding into intracellular vesicles, and requires the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway to release virus particles, and the released HEV particles with a lipid membrane retain the trans-Golgi network protein 2 on their surface. To examine whether HEV utilizes the exosomal pathway to release the virus particles, we analysed whether the virion release from PLC/PRF/5 cells infected with genotype 3 HEV (strain JE03-1760F) is affected by treatment with bafilomycin A1 or GW4869, or by the introduction of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Rab27A or Hrs. The extracellular HEV RNA titre was increased by treatment with bafilomycin A1, but was decreased by treatment with GW4869. The relative levels of virus particles released from cells depleted of Rab27A or Hrs were decreased to 16.1 and 11.5 %, respectively, of that released from cells transfected with negative control siRNA. Electron microscopic observations revealed the presence of membrane-associated virus-like particles with a diameter of approximately 50 nm within the MVB, which possessed internal vesicles in infected cells. Immunoelectron microscopy showed positive immunogold staining for the HEV ORF2 protein on the intraluminal vesicles within the MVB. Additionally, immunofluorescence analysis indicated the triple co-localization of the ORF2, ORF3 and CD63 proteins in the cytoplasm, as specific loculated signals, supporting the presence of membrane-associated HEV particles within the MVB. These findings indicate that membrane-associated HEV particles are released together with internal vesicles through MVBs by the cellular exosomal pathway.

J Control Release	2014	Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been proposed for delivering anticancer agents because of their ability to home in on tumor microenvironment. We found that MSCs can acquire strong anti-tumor activity after priming with Paclitaxel (PTX) through their capacity to uptake and then release the drug. Because MSCs secrete a high amount of membrane microvesicles (MVs), we here investigated the role of MVs in the releasing mechanism of PTX. The murine SR4987 line was used as MSC model. The release of PTX from SR4987 in the conditioned medium (CM) was checked by HPLC and the anti-tumor activity of both CM and MVs was tested on the human pancreatic cell line CFPAC-1. MVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation, analyzed by transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the presence of PTX by the Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy. SR4987 loaded with PTX (SR4987PTX) secreted a significant amount of PTX and their CM possessed strong anti-proliferative activity on CFPAC-1. At TEM and SEM, SR4987PTX showed an increased number of "vacuole-like" structures and shed a relevant number of MVs, but did not differ from untreated SR4987. However, SR4987PTX-derived-MVs (SR4987PTX-MVs) demonstrated a strong anti proliferative activity on CFPAC-1. FTIR analysis of SR4987PTX-MVs showed the presence of an absorption spectrum in the corresponding regions of the PTX marker, absent in MVs from SR4987. Our work is the first demonstration that MSCs are able to package and deliver active drugs through their MVs, suggesting the possibility of using MSCs as a factory to develop drugs with a higher cell-target specificity.

In vitro evaluation of endothelial exosomes as carriers for small interfering ribonucleic acid delivery.	Int J Nanomedicine	2014	Exosomes, one subpopulation of nanosize extracellular vesicles derived from multivesicular bodies, ranging from 30 to 150 nm in size, emerged as promising carriers for small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) delivery, as they are capable of transmitting molecular messages between cells through carried small noncoding RNAs, messenger RNAs, deoxyribonucleic acids, and proteins. Endothelial cells are involved in a number of important biological processes, and are a major source of circulating exosomes. In this study, we prepared exosomes from endothelial cells and evaluated their capacity to deliver siRNA into primary endothelial cells. Exosomes were isolated and purified by sequential centrifugation and ultracentrifugation from cultured mouse aortic endothelial cells. Similar to exosome particles from other cell sources, endothelial exosomes are nanometer-size vesicles, examined by both the NanoSight instrument and transmission electron microscopy. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis confirmed the expression of two exosome markers: CD9 and CD63. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy studies demonstrated that endothelial exosomes were heterogeneously distributed within cells. In a gene-silencing study with luciferase-expressing endothelial cells, exosomes loaded with siRNA inhibited luciferase expression by more than 40%. In contrast, siRNA alone and control siRNA only suppressed luciferase expression by less than 15%. In conclusion, we demonstrated that endothelial exosomes have the capability to accommodate and deliver short foreign nucleic acids into endothelial cells.	PMC4159392

Adv Exp Med Biol	2015	Nanovesicles present in urine the so-called urinary exosomes have been found to be secreted by every epithelial cell type lining the urinary tract system in human. Urinary exosomes are an appealing source for biomarker discovery as they contain molecular constituents of their cell of origin, including proteins and genetic materials, and they can be isolated in a non-invasive manner. Following the discovery of urinary exosomes in 2004, many studies have been performed using urinary exosomes as a starting material to identify biomarkers in various renal, urogenital, and systemic diseases. Here, we describe the discovery of urinary exosomes and address the issues on the collection, isolation, and normalization of urinary exosomes as well as delineate the systems biology approach to biomarker discovery using urinary exosomes.

Virol J	2014	BACKGROUND: The current vaccines failed to provide substantial protection against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and the new vaccine development faces great challenges. Sialoadhesin (Sn) and CD163 are the two key receptors for PRRS virus (PRRSV) infection of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), but the artificial microRNA (amiRNA) strategy targeting two viral receptors has not been described. METHODS: The candidate miRNAs targeting Sn or CD163 receptor were predicted using a web-based miRNA design tool and validated by transfection of cells with each amiRNA expression vector plus the reporter vector. The amiRNA-expressing recombinant adenoviruses (rAds) were generated using AdEasy Adenoviral Vector System. The rAd transduction efficiencies for pig cells were measured by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. The expression and exosome-mediated secretion of amiRNAs were detected by RT-PCR. The knock-down of Sn or CD163 receptor by rAd- and/or exosome-delivered amiRNA was detected by quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry. The additive anti-PRRSV effect between the two amiRNAs was detected by quantitative RT-PCR and viral titration. RESULTS: All 18 amiRNAs validated were effective against Sn or CD163 receptor mRNA expression. Two rAds expressing Sn- or CD163-targeted amiRNA were generated for further study. The maximal rAd transduction efficiency was 62% for PAMs at MOI 800 or 100% for PK-15 cells at MOI 100. The sequence-specific amiRNAs were expressed efficiently in and secreted from the rAd-transduced cells via exosomes. The expression of Sn and CD163 receptors was inhibited significantly by rAd transduction and/or amiRNA-containing exosome treatment at mRNA and protein levels. Both PRRSV ORF7 copy number and viral titer were reduced significantly by transduction of PAMs with the two rAds and/or by treatment with the two amiRNA-containing exosomes. The additive anti-PRRSV effect between the two amiRNAs was relatively long-lasting (96 h) and effective against three different viral strains. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that Sn- and CD163-targeted amiRNAs had an additive anti-PRRSV effect against different viral strains. Our findings provide new evidence supporting the hypothesis that exosomes can also serve as an efficient small RNA transfer vehicle for pig cells.	PMC4279792

J Transl Med	2015	BACKGROUND: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hiPSC-MSCs) have emerged as a promising alternative for stem cell transplantation therapy. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-Exos) can play important roles in repairing injured tissues. However, to date, no reports have demonstrated the use of hiPSC-MSC-Exos in cutaneous wound healing, and little is known regarding their underlying mechanisms in tissue repair. METHODS: hiPSC-MSC-Exos were injected subcutaneously around wound sites in a rat model and the efficacy of hiPSC-MSC-Exos was assessed by measuring wound closure areas, by histological and immunofluorescence examinations. We also evaluated the in vitro effects of hiPSC-MSC-Exos on both the proliferation and migration of human dermal fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by cell-counting and scratch assays, respectively. The effects of exosomes on fibroblast collagen and elastin secretion were studied in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In vitro capillary network formation was determined in tube-formation assays. RESULTS: Transplanting hiPSC-MSC-Exos to wound sites resulted in accelerated re-epithelialization, reduced scar widths, and the promotion of collagen maturity. Moreover, hiPSC-MSC-Exos not only promoted the generation of newly formed vessels, but also accelerated their maturation in wound sites. We found that hiPSC-MSC-Exos stimulated the proliferation and migration of human dermal fibroblasts and HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Similarly, Type I, III collagen and elastin secretion and mRNA expression by fibroblasts and tube formation by HUVECs were also increased with increasing hiPSC-MSC-Exos concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that hiPSC-MSC-Exos can facilitate cutaneous wound healing by promoting collagen synthesis and angiogenesis. These data provide the first evidence for the potential of hiPSC-MSC-Exos in treating cutaneous wounds.	PMC4371881

Hum Mol Genet	2015	Invasive colorectal cancer is associated with poor prognosis requiring treatment with systemic chemotherapies usually including 5-fluorouracil. A consequence of prolonged treatment is the acquisition of resistance eventually resulting in the recurrence of highly metastatic cancer cells. To address the relationship between drug resistance and increased lymphatic metastatic potential, we used a 3D co-culture model of colon tumour cell spheroids of parent CCL227 cells and subclones with gradually increasing resistance against 5-fluorouracil. From each investigated cell line, homogeneous tumour spheroids were generated in the presence of methylcellulose yielding emboli of ∼700 µm diameter. When invasive, tumour spheroids disrupt the continuous lymphendothelial cell (LEC) layer and generate a 'circular chemorepellent-induced defect' (CCID), reminiscent of the entry gates through which tumour emboli intravasate lymphatic vasculature. Here we provide evidence that increasingly chemoresistant colon cancer spheroids were strongly associated with enhanced intravasative properties. In naïve CCL227 spheroids, miR-200 family members were released into exosomes thereby repressing the epithelial to mesenchymal transition-regulating transcription factors ZEB1 and SLUG in LEC. As a consequence of attenuated plasticity and migration of LEC, CCID formation was impaired. Loss of exosomal transferred miR-200c in resistant colon cells rendered LEC more susceptible to pro-migratory signals that were generated and directly transmitted by colon cancer spheroids. This observation indicates a common molecular axis in colon cancer and LEC where miR-200 family members act as regulators of ZEB proteins. The data support the notion that horizontal miR-200 signalling prevents the permeation of cells into adjacent epithelia and contributes to organ integrity.

Exosomes derived from alcohol-treated hepatocytes horizontally transfer liver specific miRNA-122 and sensitize monocytes to LPS.	Sci Rep	2015	Hepatocyte damage and inflammation in monocytes/macrophages are central to the pathogenesis of alcoholic hepatitis (AH). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate all of these processes. MiRNA-122 is abundantly expressed in hepatocytes while monocytes/macrophages have low levels. The role of exosomes in AH and possible cross talk between hepatocyte-derived exosomes and immune cells is not explored yet. Here, we show that the number of exosomes significantly increases in the sera of healthy individuals after alcohol binge drinking and in mice after binge or chronic alcohol consumption. Exosomes isolated from sera after alcohol consumption or from in vitro ethanol-treated hepatocytes contained miRNA-122. Exosomes derived from ethanol-treated Huh7.5 cells were taken up by the recipients THP1 monocytes and horizontally transferred a mature form of liver-specific miRNA-122. In vivo, liver mononuclear cells and Kupffer cells from alcohol-fed mice had increased miRNA-122 levels. In monocytes, miRNA-122 transferred via exosomes inhibited the HO-1 pathway and sensitized to LPS stimulation and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Finally, inflammatory effects of exosomes from ethanol-treated hepatocytes were prevented by using RNA interference via exosome-mediated delivery of a miRNA-122 inhibitor. These results demonstrate that first, exosomes mediate communication between hepatocytes and monocytes/macrophages and second, hepatocyte-derived miRNA-122 can reprogram monocytes inducing sensitization to LPS.

HIV-1 Myristoylated Nef Treatment of Murine Microglial Cells Activates Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase, NO2 Production and Neurotoxic Activity.	PLoS One	2015	BACKGROUND: The potential role of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) accessory protein Nef in the pathogenesis of neuroAIDS is still poorly understood. Nef is a molecular adapter that influences several cellular signal transduction events and membrane trafficking. In human macrophages, Nef expression induces the production of extracellular factors (e.g. pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines) and the recruitment of T cells, thus favoring their infection and its own transfer to uninfected cells via exosomes, cellular protrusions or cell-to-cell contacts. Murine cells are normally not permissive for HIV-1 but, in transgenic mice, Nef is a major disease determinant. Both in human and murine macrophages, myristoylated Nef (myr+Nef) treatment has been shown to activate NF-κB, MAP kinases and interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF-3), thereby inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT)-1, STAT-2 and STAT-3 through the production of proinflammatory factors. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report that treatment of BV-2 murine microglial cells with myr+Nef leads to STAT-1, -2 and -3 tyrosine phosphorylation and upregulates the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) with production of nitric oxide. We provide evidence that extracellular Nef regulates iNOS expression through NF-κB activation and, at least in part, interferon-β (IFNβ) release that acts in concert with Nef. All of these effects require both myristoylation and a highly conserved acidic cluster in the viral protein. Finally, we report that Nef induces the release of neurotoxic factors in the supernatants of microglial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a potential role of extracellular Nef in promoting neuronal injury in the murine model. They also indicate a possible interplay between Nef and host factors in the pathogenesis of neuroAIDS through the production of reactive nitrogen species in microglial cells.	PMC4465743

Exposure to ALS-FTD-CSF generates TDP-43 aggregates in glioblastoma cells through exosomes and TNTs-like structure.	Oncotarget	2015	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) represent a continuum of devastating neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) aggregates accumulation throughout the nervous system. Despite rapidly emerging evidence suggesting the hypothesis of 'prion-like propagation' of TDP-43 positive inclusion in the regional spread of ALS symptoms, whether and how TDP-43 aggregates spread between cells is not clear. Herein, we established a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-cultured cell model to dissect mechanisms governing TDP-43 aggregates formation and propagation. Remarkably, intracellular TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregates were induced in the human glioma U251 cells following exposure to ALS-FTD-CSF but not ALS-CSF and normal control (NC) -CSF for 21 days. The exosomes derived from ALS-FTD-CSF were enriched in TDP-43 C-terminal fragments (CTFs). Incubation of ALS-FTD-CSF induced the increase of mislocated TDP-43 positive exosomes in U251 cells. We further demonstrated that exposure to ALS-FTD-CSF induced the generations of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-like structure and exosomes at different stages, which mediated the propagation of TDP-43 aggregates in the cultured U251 cells. Moreover, immunoblotting analyses revealed that abnormal activations of apoptosis and autophagy were induced in U251 cells, following incubation of ALS-CSF and ALS-FTD-CSF. Taken together, our data provide direct evidence that ALS-FTD-CSF has prion-like transmissible properties. TNTs-like structure and exosomes supply the routes for the transfer of TDP-43 aggregates, and selective inhibition of their over-generations may interrupt the progression of TDP-43 proteinopathy.

Urothelial cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition after exposure to muscle invasive bladder cancer exosomes.	Oncogenesis	2015	Bladder cancer, the fourth most common noncutaneous malignancy in the United States, is characterized by high recurrence rate, with a subset of these cancers progressing to a deadly muscle invasive form of disease. Exosomes are small secreted vesicles that contain proteins, mRNA and miRNA, thus potentially modulating signaling pathways in recipient cells. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion and gain migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal stem cells. EMT has been implicated in the initiation of metastasis for cancer progression. We investigated the ability of bladder cancer-shed exosomes to induce EMT in urothelial cells. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation from T24 or UMUC3 invasive bladder cancer cell conditioned media or from patient urine or bladder barbotage samples. Exosomes were then added to the urothelial cells and EMT was assessed. Urothelial cells treated with bladder cancer exosomes showed an increased expression in several mesenchymal markers, including α-smooth muscle actin, S100A4 and snail, as compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated cells. Moreover, treatment of urothelial cells with bladder cancer exosomes resulted in decreased expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin and β-catenin, as compared with the control, PBS-treated cells. Bladder cancer exosomes also increased the migration and invasion of urothelial cells, and this was blocked by heparin pretreatment. We further showed that exosomes isolated from patient urine and bladder barbotage samples were able to induce the expression of several mesenchymal markers in recipient urothelial cells. In conclusion, the research presented here represents both a new insight into the role of exosomes in transition of bladder cancer into invasive disease, as well as an introduction to a new platform for exosome research in urothelial cells.

Extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer of CLIC1 protein is a novel mechanism for the regulation of glioblastoma growth.	Oncotarget	2015	Little progresses have been made in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive and lethal among brain tumors. Recently we have demonstrated that Chloride Intracellular Channel-1 (CLIC1) is overexpressed in GBM compared to normal tissues, with highest expression in patients with poor prognosis. Moreover, CLIC1-silencing in cancer stem cells (CSCs) isolated from human GBM patients negatively influences proliferative capacity and self-renewal properties in vitro and impairs the in vivo tumorigenic potential. Here we show that CLIC1 exists also as a circulating protein, secreted via extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by either cell lines or GBM-derived CSCs. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), comprising exosomes and microvesicles based on their composition and biophysical properties, have been shown to sustain tumor growth in a variety of model systems, including GBM. Interestingly, treatment of GBM cells with CLIC1-containing EVs stimulates cell growth both in vitro and in vivo in a CLIC1-dose dependent manner. EVs derived from CLIC1-overexpressing GBM cells are strong inducers of proliferation in vitro and tumor engraftment in vivo. These stimulations are significantly attenuated by treatment of GBM cells with EVs derived from CLIC1-silenced cells. However, CLIC1 modulation appears to have no direct role in EV structure, biogenesis and secretion. These findings reveal that, apart from the function of CLIC1 cellular reservoir, CLIC1 contained in EVs is a novel regulator of GBM growth.	PMC4741615

J Biol Chem	2015	Exosomes are cell-derived extracellular vesicles thought to promote intercellular communication by delivering specific content to target cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether endothelial cell (EC)-derived exosomes could regulate the phenotype of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Initial microarray studies showed that fibroblast growth factor 2 induced a 2.4-fold increase in mRNA levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1). Exosomes derived from an SK1-overexpressing EC line increased HSC migration 3.2-fold. Migration was not conferred by the dominant negative SK1 exosome. Incubation of HSCs with exosomes was also associated with an 8.3-fold increase in phosphorylation of AKT and 2.5-fold increase in migration. Exosomes were found to express the matrix protein and integrin ligand fibronectin (FN) by Western blot analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Blockade of the FN-integrin interaction with a CD29 neutralizing antibody or the RGD peptide attenuated exosome-induced HSC AKT phosphorylation and migration. Inhibition of endocytosis with transfection of dynamin siRNA, the dominant negative dynamin GTPase construct Dyn2K44A, or the pharmacological inhibitor Dynasore significantly attenuated exosome-induced AKT phosphorylation. SK1 levels were increased in serum exosomes derived from mice with experimental liver fibrosis, and SK1 mRNA levels were up-regulated 2.5-fold in human liver cirrhosis patient samples. Finally, S1PR2 inhibition protected mice from CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Therefore, EC-derived SK1-containing exosomes regulate HSC signaling and migration through FN-integrin-dependent exosome adherence and dynamin-dependent exosome internalization. These findings advance our understanding of EC/HSC cross-talk and identify exosomes as a potential target to attenuate pathobiology signals.	PMC4692200

Brain	2016	Extracellular α-synuclein has been proposed as a crucial mechanism for induction of pathological aggregate formation in previously healthy cells. In vitro, extracellular α-synuclein is partially associated with exosomal vesicles. Recently, we have provided evidence that exosomal α-synuclein is present in the central nervous system in vivo. We hypothesized that exosomal α-synuclein species from patients with α-synuclein related neurodegeneration serve as carriers for interneuronal disease transmission. We isolated exosomes from cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, progressive supranuclear palsy as a non-α-synuclein related disorder that clinically overlaps with Parkinson's disease, and neurological controls. Cerebrospinal fluid exosome numbers, α-synuclein protein content of cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and their potential to induce oligomerization of α-synuclein were analysed. The quantification of cerebrospinal fluid exosomal α-synuclein showed distinct differences between patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. In addition, exosomal α-synuclein levels correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment in cross-sectional samples from patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. Importantly, cerebrospinal fluid exosomes derived from Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies induce oligomerization of α-synuclein in a reporter cell line in a dose-dependent manner. Our data suggest that cerebrospinal fluid exosomes from patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies contain a pathogenic species of α-synuclein, which could initiate oligomerization of soluble α-synuclein in target cells and confer disease pathology.

Exosomes derived from mineralizing osteoblasts promote ST2 cell osteogenic differentiation by alteration of microRNA expression.	FEBS Lett	2016	Mineralizing osteoblasts (MOBs) can release exosomes, although the functional significance remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that exosomes derived from mineralizing pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells can promote bone marrow stromal cell (ST2) differentiation to osteoblasts. We reveal that MOB-derived exosomes significantly influence miRNA profiles in recipient ST2 cells, and these changes tend to activate the Wnt signaling pathway by inhibiting Axin1 expression and increasing β-catenin expression. We also suggest that MOB derived-exosomes partly induce the variation in miRNA expression in recipient ST2 cells by exosomal miRNA transfer. These findings suggest an exosome-mediated mode of cell-to-cell communication in the osteogenic microenvironment, and also indicate the potential of MOB exosomes in bone tissue engineering.

China. .	wangniansong2012@163.com		Exosomes secreted by human urine-derived stem cells could prevent kidney complications from type I diabetes in rats.	Stem Cell Res Ther	2016	BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy is one of the most serious complications in patients with diabetes. At present, there are no satisfactory treatments available for diabetic nephropathy. Stem cells are currently the main candidates for the development of new treatments for diabetic nephropathy, as they may exert their therapeutic effects mainly through paracrine mechanisms. Exosomes derived from stem cells have been reported to play an important role in kidney injury. In this article, we try to investigate whether exosomes retrieved from urine stem cells could itself prevent diabetic nephropathy at an early stage in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Exosomes from conditioned medium of urine-derived stem cells (USCs-Exo) were isolated using ultrafiltration-combined purification methods. USCs-Exo were then verified by morphology, size, and specific biomarkers using transmission electron microscopy, tunable resistive pulse sensing analysis, and western blotting. After establishment of the streptozotocin-induced Sprague-Dawley rat model, the effects of USCs-Exo on kidney injury and angiogenesis were observed via weekly tail intravenous injection of USCs-Exo or control until 12 weeks. In vitro, podocytes cultured in high-glucose medium were treated with USCs-Exo to test the protective effect of USCs-Exo on podocytic apoptosis. Meanwhile, the potential factors in promoting vascular regeneration in USCs-Exo and urine-derived stem cell conditioned medium were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Urine-derived stem cells were cultured and were verified by positive markers for CD29, CD73, CD90 and CD44 antigens, and negative markers for CD34, CD45 and HLA-DR. USCs-Exo were approximately 50-100 nm spherical vesicles, and the specific markers included CD9, CD63 and CD81. Intravenous injections of USCs-Exo could potentially reduce the urine volume and urinary microalbumin excretion, prevent podocyte and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis, suppress the caspase-3 overexpression and increase glomerular endothelial cell proliferation in diabetic rats. In addition, USCs-Exo could reduce podocytic apoptosis induced by high glucose in vitro. USCs-Exo contained the potential factors, including growth factor, transforming growth factor-β1, angiogenin and bone morphogenetic protein-7, which may be related with vascular regeneration and cell survival. CONCLUSION: USCs-Exo may have the potential to prevent kidney injury from diabetes by inhibiting podocyte apoptosis and promoting vascular regeneration and cell survival.	PMC4744390

Prostate stromal cell proteomics analysis discriminates normal from tumour reactive stromal phenotypes.	Oncotarget	2016	Changes within interstitial stromal compartments often accompany carcinogenesis, and this is true of prostate cancer. Typically, the tissue becomes populated by myofibroblasts that can promote progression. Not all myofibroblasts exhibit the same negative influence, however, and identifying the aggressive form of myofibroblast may provide useful information at diagnosis. A means of molecularly defining such myofibroblasts is unknown. We compared protein profiles of normal and diseased stroma isolated from prostate cancer patients to identify discriminating hallmarks of disease-associated stroma. We included the stimulation of normal stromal cells with known myofibroblast inducers namely soluble TGFβ and exosome-associated-TGFβ and compared the function and protein profiles arising. In all 6-patients examined, diseased stroma exhibited a pro-angiogenic influence on endothelial cells, generating large multicellular vessel-like structures. Identical structures were apparent following stimulation of normal stroma with exosomes (5/6 patients), but TGFβ-stimulation generated a non-angiogenic stroma. Proteomics highlighted disease-related cytoskeleton alterations such as elevated Transgelin (TAGLN). Many of these were also changed following TGFβ or exosome stimulation and did not well discriminate the nature of the stimulus. Soluble TGFβ, however triggered differential expression of proteins related to mitochondrial function including voltage dependent ion channels VDAC1 and 2, and this was not found in the other stromal types studied. Surprisingly, Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH1A1), a stem-cell associated protein was detected in normal stromal cells and found to decrease in disease. In summary, we have discovered a set of proteins that contribute to defining disease-associated myofibroblasts, and emphasise the similarity between exosome-generated myofibroblasts and those naturally arising in situ.

Cetuximab treatment alters the content of extracellular vesicles released from tumor cells.	Nanomedicine (Lond)	2016	AIM: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are attractive candidates for biomarker research, because their content reflects the parental cell status. This study aimed to examine whether tumor cell derived EVs mirrored the cellular changes caused by treatment with cetuximab, a therapeutic antibody that blocks activation of EGF receptor (EGFR). MATERIALS & METHODS: A-431 cells were treated with cetuximab for 48 h. EVs were isolated using differential centrifugation and protein content was analyzed using western blotting. RESULTS: EV levels of EGFR and phospho-EGFR were reduced after cetuximab treatment, reflecting similar changes in the parental cells. In addition, cetuximab was found associated with EVs. CONCLUSION: EVs could serve as biomarkers to monitor cetuximab treatment. Association of cetuximab with EVs might influence its behavior.

Palmitoylated claudin7 captured in glycolipid-enriched membrane microdomains promotes metastasis via associated transmembrane and cytosolic molecules.	Oncotarget	2016	In epithelial cells claudin7 (cld7) is a major component of tight junctions, but is also recovered from glycolipid-enriched membrane microdomains (GEM). In tumor cells, too, cld7 exists in two stages. Only GEM-located cld7, which is palmitoylated, promotes metastasis. Searching for the underlying mechanism(s) revealed the following.The metastatic capacity of the rat pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line ASML is lost by a knockdown (kd) of cld7 and is not regained by rescuing cld7 with a mutated palmitoylation site (cld7mPalm). ASML-cld7kd and ASML-cld7mPalm cells show reduced motility and invasiveness. This is due to cld7, but not cld7mPalm associating with α6β4, ezrin, uPAR and MMP14, which jointly support motility and invasion. Palmitoylated cld7 also is engaged in drug resistance by repressing Pten, allowing activation of the antiapoptotic PI3K/Akt pathway. An association of cld7mPalm with the major Pten phosphorylating kinases does not restore apoptosis resistance as phosphorylated Pten is not guided towards GEM to compete with non-phosphorylated Pten. The pathway whereby palmitoylated cld7 supports expression of several EMT genes and nuclear translocation of EMT transcription factors remains to be unraveled. An association with Notch, reduced in ASML-cld7mPalm cells, might be the starting point. Finally, GEM-located, palmitoylated cld7 associates with several components of vesicle transport machineries engaged in exosome biogenesis.Taken together, prerequisites for cld7 acting as a cancer-initiating cell marker are GEM location and palmitoylation, which support a multitude of associations and integration into exosomes. The latter suggests palmitoylated cld7 contributing to message transfer via exosomes.	PMC5058708

J Clin Lab Anal	2016	BACKGROUND: As the second leading cause of cancer morbidity and death in women, cervical cancer remains an important public health problem worldwide. Novel biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity for the early detection and diagnosis of cervical cancer are urgently needed. Increasing evidence shows that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are differentially expressed in cancer tissues and may serve as diagnostic markers. In multiple tumor types, exosomes harboring lncRNAs are actively released from tumor cells. In this study, we investigate the potential association of exosomal lncRNA expression with cervical cancer. METHODS: Cervicovaginal lavage specimens were collected from patients with cervical cancer and cancer-free volunteers who are HPV-positive or HPV-negative. Exosomes in these specimens were isolated by ultracentrifugation and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The exosomal lncRNAs HOTAIR, MALAT1, and MEG3 were quantified by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Expression of HOTAIR, MALAT1 and MEG3 was predominantly observed in cervical cancer-derived exosomes in cervicovaginal lavage samples. The expression levels of lncRNAs were significantly different in exosomes isolated from cervical cancer patients compared to normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that lncRNAs in exosomes isolated from cervicovaginal lavage are differentially expressed in cervical cancer patients and cancer-free volunteers. Exosomal lncRNAs may have great potential to be used for the early detection and diagnosis of cervical cancer, and serve as convenient and noninvasive biomarkers.

YKT6 expression, exosome release, and survival in non-small cell lung cancer.	Oncotarget	2016	BACKGROUND: Cancer-derived exosomes are involved in metastasis. YKT6 is a SNARE protein that participates in the regulation of exosome production and release, but its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultracentrifugation-purified exosomes from the A549 cell line were studied by CRYO-TEM, nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blot (TSG101 marker). YKT6 was inhibited using a DsiRNA and selected pre-microRNAs. MicroRNAs targeting YKT6 were validated by Renilla/Luciferase assay and western blot. YKT6 expression and its prognostic impact were analyzed in 98 tissue specimens from resected NSCLC patients. RESULTS: Membranous nanosized vesicles (mode size: 128nm) with TSG101 protein were purified from A549 cells. YKT6 inhibition reduced exosome release by 80.9%. We validated miR-134 and miR-135b as miRNAs targeting YKT6, and transfection with the pre-miRNAs also produced a significant reduction in exosome release. The analysis of YKT6 in tumor samples showed that patients with high levels had shorter disease-free and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: YKT6 is a key molecule in the regulation of exosome release in lung cancer cells and is in turn precisely regulated by miR-134 and miR-135b. Moreover, YKT6 levels impact prognosis of resected NSCLC patients.	PMC5239493

J Am Soc Nephrol	2017	Distal tubular sodium retention is a potent driver of hypertension, and the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) has a key role in this process. In humans, factors regulating NCC are unclear, but in animal models, aldosterone is a potent regulator, possibly via effects on plasma potassium. We studied the effects of the mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone on the abundance of NCC and its phosphorylated form (pNCC) as well as WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 4 (WNK4) and STE20/SPS1-related, proline alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) in human urinary exosomes. We isolated exosomes from daily urine samples in 25 patients undergoing fludrocortisone suppression testing (100 μg every 6 hours for 4 days) to diagnose or exclude primary aldosteronism. Over the course of the test, NCC levels increased 3.68-fold (P<0.01) and pNCC levels increased 2.73-fold (P<0.01) relative to baseline. The ratio of pNCC/NCC dropped by 48% (P<0.01). The abundance of WNK4 increased 3.23-fold (P<0.01), but SPAK abundance did not change significantly (P=0.14). Plasma potassium concentration strongly and negatively correlated with pNCC, NCC, and WNK4 abundance (P<0.001 for all). This study shows that, in humans, mineralocorticoid administration is associated with a rapid increase in abundance of NCC and pNCC, possibly via the WNK pathway. These effects may be driven by changes in plasma potassium.	PMC5198275

Exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 induces cancer-associated fibroblast-like properties in human breast fibroblasts.	Cell Death Dis	2016	It is established that the interaction between microenvironment and cancer cells has a critical role in tumor development, given the dependence of neoplastic cells on stromal support. However, how this communication promotes the activation of normal (NFs) into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is still not well understood. Most microRNA (miRNA) studies focused on tumor cell, but there is increasing evidence of their involvement in reprogramming NFs into CAFs. Here we show that miR-9, upregulated in various breast cancer cell lines and identified as pro-metastatic miRNA, affects the properties of human breast fibroblasts, enhancing the switch to CAF phenotype, thus contributing to tumor growth. Expressed at higher levels in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients, miR-9 improves indeed migration and invasion capabilities when transfected in immortalized NFs; viceversa, these properties are strongly impaired in CAFs upon miR-9 inhibition. We also demonstrate that tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake results in enhanced cell motility. Moreover, we observed that this miRNA is also secreted by fibroblasts and in turn able to alter tumor cell behavior, by modulating its direct target E-cadherin, and NFs themselves. Consistently with the biological effects observed, gene expression profiles of NFs upon transient transfection with miR-9 show the modulation of genes mainly involved in cell motility and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways. Finally, we were able to confirm the capability of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 to promote in vivo tumor growth. Taken together, these data provide new insights into the role of miR-9 as an important player in the cross-talk between cancer cells and stroma.	PMC4973361

Electronic address: .	yxiong1@hfhs.org		Systemic administration of cell-free exosomes generated by human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells cultured under 2D and 3D conditions improves functional recovery in rats after traumatic brain injury.	Neurochem Int	2017	Multipotent human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) improve functional outcome after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study was designed to investigate whether systemic administration of cell-free exosomes generated from hMSCs cultured in 2-dimensional (2D) conventional conditions or in 3-dimensional (3D) collagen scaffolds promote functional recovery and neurovascular remodeling in rats after TBI. Wistar rats were subjected to TBI induced by controlled cortical impact; 24 h later tail vein injection of exosomes derived from hMSCs cultured under 2D or 3D conditions or an equal number of liposomes as a treatment control were performed. The modified Morris water maze, neurological severity score and footfault tests were employed to evaluate cognitive and sensorimotor functional recovery. Animals were sacrificed at 35 days after TBI. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed for measurements of lesion volume, neurovascular remodeling (angiogenesis and neurogenesis), and neuroinflammation. Compared with liposome-treated control, exosome-treatments did not reduce lesion size but significantly improved spatial learning at 33-35 days measured by the Morris water maze test, and sensorimotor functional recovery, i.e., reduced neurological deficits and footfault frequency, observed at 14-35 days post injury (p < 0.05). Exosome treatments significantly increased the number of newborn endothelial cells in the lesion boundary zone and dentate gyrus, and significantly increased the number of newborn mature neurons in the dentate gyrus as well as reduced neuroinflammation. Exosomes derived from hMSCs cultured in 3D scaffolds provided better outcome in spatial learning than exosomes from hMSCs cultured in the 2D condition. In conclusion, hMSC-generated exosomes significantly improve functional recovery in rats after TBI, at least in part, by promoting endogenous angiogenesis and neurogenesis and reducing neuroinflammation. Thus, exosomes derived from hMSCs may be a novel cell-free therapy for TBI, and hMSC-scaffold generated exosomes may selectively enhance spatial learning.	PMC5311054

Electronic address: .	wangzhiwei@whu.edu.cn		Human aortic smooth muscle cell-derived exosomal miR-221/222 inhibits autophagy via a PTEN/Akt signaling pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2016	Dysregulation of autophagy in endothelial cells plays a vital role in cardiovascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Accumulating evidence shows that miRNAs regulate autophagy in various cell types by targeting autophagy-related genes. In the present study, we found that a co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs) inhibited autophagy activity in HUVECs. Furthermore, we isolated exosomes secreted by HAoSMCs, and confirmed that the exosomes contain miR-221/222. We investigated the role of miR-221/222 transferred by HAoSMC-derived exosomes in HUVECs. These exosomes induced an increase of miR-221/222 expression and a down-regulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) in HUVECs. Dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-221/222 could bind to the 3'UTR of PTEN, which implied that PTEN was a direct target of miR-221/222. The expression of PTEN could be down-regulated by miR-221/222 over-expression. Then, we detected the expression of PTEN, LC3, ATG5, SQSTM1/p62, Beclin-1, Akt, and phospho-Akt in HUVECs transfected with miR-221/222 mimics and inhibitors. Our results demonstrated that miR-221/222 overexpression inhibited the expression of PTEN and subsequently activated Akt signaling, and eventually down-regulated the expression of LC3II, ATG5 and Beclin-1, and elevated the expression of SQSTM1/p62. This phenomenon can be reversed by the transfection of miR-221/222 inhibitors. These data suggested that miR-221/222 from HAoSMC-derived exosomes inhibited autophagy in HUVECs by modulating PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.

Electronic address: .	ytakahashi@pharm.kyoto-u.ac.jp		Cell type-specific and common characteristics of exosomes derived from mouse cell lines: Yield, physicochemical properties, and pharmacokinetics.	Eur J Pharm Sci	2017	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles secreted from cells and are expected to be used as drug delivery systems. Important characteristics of exosomes, such as yield, physicochemical properties, and pharmacokinetics, may be different among different cell types. However, there is limited information about the effect of cell type on these characteristics. In the present study, we evaluated these characteristics of exosomes derived from five different types of mouse cell lines: B16BL6 murine melanoma cells, C2C12 murine myoblast cells, NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts cells, MAEC murine aortic endothelial cells, and RAW264.7 murine macrophage-like cells. Exosomes were collected using a differential ultracentrifugation method. The exosomes collected from all the cell types were negatively charged globular vesicles with a diameter of approximately 100nm. C2C12 and RAW264.7 cells produced more exosomes than the other types of cells. The exosomes were labeled with a fusion protein of Gaussia luciferase and lactadherin to evaluate their pharmacokinetics. After intravenous injection into mice, all the exosomes rapidly disappeared from the systemic circulation and mainly distributed to the liver. In conclusion, the exosome yield was significantly different among the cell types, and all the exosomes evaluated in this study showed comparable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties.

Tumor Cell-Derived Exosomes from the Prostate Cancer Cell Line TRAMP-C1 Impair Osteoclast Formation and Differentiation.	PLoS One	2016	Skeletal metastatic disease is a deleterious consequence of dissemination of tumor cells from numerous primary sites, such as prostate, lung and breast. Skeletal metastases are still incurable, resulting in development of clinical complications and decreased survival for cancer patients with metastatic disease. During the last decade, tumor cell-derived microvesicles have been identified and suggested to be involved in cancer disease progression. Whether cancer exosomes are involved in tumor and bone cell interactions in the metastatic site is still, however, a rather unexplored field. Here we show that exosomes isolated from the murine prostate cancer cell line TRAMP-C1 dramatically decrease fusion and differentiation of monocytic osteoclast precursors to mature, multinucleated osteoclasts. The presence of tumor cell-derived exosomes also clearly decreased the expression of established markers for osteoclast fusion and differentiation, including DC-STAMP, TRAP, cathepsin K, and MMP-9. In contrast, exosomes derived from murine fibroblastic cells did not affect osteoclast formation. Our findings suggest that exosomes released from tumor cells in the tumor-bone interface are involved in pathological regulation of bone cell formation in the metastatic site. This further strengthens the role of tumor cell-derived microvesicles in cancer progression and disease aggressiveness.	PMC5104397

Circ Res	2017	RATIONALE: Cardiac progenitor cells are an attractive cell type for tissue regeneration, but their mechanism for myocardial remodeling is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: This investigation determines how chronological age influences the phenotypic characteristics and the secretome of human cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), and their potential to recover injured myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult (aCPCs) and neonatal (nCPCs) cells were derived from patients aged >40 years or <1 month, respectively, and their functional potential was determined in a rodent myocardial infarction model. A more robust in vitro proliferative capacity of nCPCs, compared with aCPCs, correlated with significantly greater myocardial recovery mediated by nCPCs in vivo. Strikingly, a single injection of nCPC-derived total conditioned media was significantly more effective than nCPCs, aCPC-derived TCM, or nCPC-derived exosomes in recovering cardiac function, stimulating neovascularization, and promoting myocardial remodeling. High-resolution accurate mass spectrometry with reverse phase liquid chromatography fractionation and mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins in the secretome of aCPCs and nCPCs, and the literature-based networking software identified specific pathways affected by the secretome of CPCs in the setting of myocardial infarction. Examining the TCM, we quantified changes in the expression pattern of 804 proteins in nCPC-derived TCM and 513 proteins in aCPC-derived TCM. The literature-based proteomic network analysis identified that 46 and 6 canonical signaling pathways were significantly targeted by nCPC-derived TCM and aCPC-derived TCM, respectively. One leading candidate pathway is heat-shock factor-1, potentially affecting 8 identified pathways for nCPC-derived TCM but none for aCPC-derived TCM. To validate this prediction, we demonstrated that the modulation of heat-shock factor-1 by knockdown in nCPCs or overexpression in aCPCs significantly altered the quality of their secretome. CONCLUSIONS: A deep proteomic analysis revealed both detailed and global mechanisms underlying the chronological age-based differences in the ability of CPCs to promote myocardial recovery via the components of their secretome.

Neutral Ceramidase Secreted Via Exosome Protects Against Palmitate-Induced Apoptosis in INS-1 Cells.	Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes	2017	Aims: To investigate the effects of neutral ceramidase (NCDase) packaged in exosomes that are secreted from β-cells on free fatty acid (FFA)-induced β-cells apoptosis and its role in regulation of sphingolipid-mediated signaling pathway. Methods: HPLC and Western blotting were performed to determine NCDase activity and expression. Annexin V-fluorescein-isothiocyanate/propidium iodide flow cytometry was used to assess apoptosis. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was used for ceramide (Cer), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and sphingosine (SPH) determination. Results: INS-1 cells over-expressed NCDase secreted active NCDase via exosomes. Exosomes isolated from the cultured medium of INS-1 cells that oxpressed NCDase could ameliorate palmitate-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the results showed that exosome-derived NCDase treatment reduced intracellular Cer/S1P ratio. Conclusions: β-cell secreted active NCDase via exosome, the exosome-packaged-NCDase protected β-cells from FFA-induced apoptosis through regulating sphingolipid metabolites and it might be a potential treatment for β-cell lipotoxicity and type 2 diabetes.

Exosomal miR-146a Contributes to the Enhanced Therapeutic Efficacy of Interleukin-1β-Primed Mesenchymal Stem Cells Against Sepsis.	Stem Cells	2017	Improving the immunomodulatory efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through pretreatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines is an evolving field of investigation. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully clarified. Here, we pretreated human umbilical cord-derived MSCs with interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and evaluated their therapeutic effects in a cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis model. We found that systemic administration of IL-1β-pretreated MSCs (βMSCs) ameliorated the symptoms of murine sepsis more effectively and increased the survival rate compared with naïve MSCs. Furthermore, βMSCs could more effectively induce macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype through the paracrine activity. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that βMSC-derived exosomes contributed to the enhanced immunomodulatory properties of βMSCs both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we found that miR-146a, a well-known anti-inflammatory microRNA, was strongly upregulated by IL-1β stimulation and selectively packaged into exosomes. This exosomal miR-146a was transferred to macrophages, resulted in M2 polarization, and finally led to increased survival in septic mice. In contrast, inhibition of miR-146a through transfection with miR-146a inhibitors partially negated the immunomodulatory properties of βMSC-derived exosomes. Taken together, IL-1β pretreatment effectively enhanced the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs partially through exosome-mediated transfer of miR-146a. Therefore, we believe that IL-1β pretreatment may provide a new modality for better therapeutic application of MSCs in inflammatory disorders. Stem Cells 2017;35:1208-1221.

Breast Cancer Res Treat	2017	PURPOSE: We investigated whether miRNAs in exosomes from EMT6 or 4THM tumor-bearing mice played a role in regulating inflammatory cytokine expression and/or metastasis in WT mice injected with EMT6 and/or 4THM tumor cells. METHODS: EMT6 tumors in BALB/c CD200R1KO mice resolve following surgical resection of localized tumor and immunization with irradiated EMT6 cells along with CpG as adjuvant. Wild-type (WT) animals treated in the same fashion develop pulmonary and liver metastases within 20 days of surgery. DLNs from CD200R1KO mice contain no tumor cells detectable at limiting dilution. In contrast, 4THM tumor cells injected into CD200R1KO show increased metastasis compared with WT mice. Transfer of serum exosomes from 4THM tumor-bearing mice to WT animals increased metastasis of EMT6 tumors, an effect attenuated by anti-IL-6 antibody. We compared miRNA expression in exosomes from the serum of 4THM/EMT6 WT or CD200R1KO tumor-bearing mice, and the effects of antagomirs to miRNAs on tumor growth. RESULTS: Complex changes in miRNA expression were observed in the isolated exosomes. Some miRNAs, including miR155, have been reported to potentiate inflammatory responses and augment inflammatory cytokine expression. Expression of miR155 increased in exosomes from 4THM relative to EMT6 tumor bearers, and antagomirs to miR155 attenuated tumor growth and metastasis, and improved survival, following infusion into WT mice. Antagomirs to the miR205 family were thought to affect metastasis by targeting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), increased growth and metastasis in both 4THM and EMT6 tumor-bearing mice, and decreased survival, with some modulation of inflammatory cytokine production. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple pathways are implicated in differential metastasis of EMT6/4THM, and targeting these may have clinical utility in human breast cancer.

Extracellular vesicles mediate signaling between the aqueous humor producing and draining cells in the ocular system.	PLoS One	2017	PURPOSE: Canonical Wnt signaling is associated with glaucoma pathogenesis and intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation. Our goal was to gain insight into the influence of non-pigmented ciliary epithelium (NPCE)-derived exosomes on Wnt signaling by trabecular meshwork (TM) cells. The potential impact of exosomes on Wnt signaling in the ocular drainage system remains poorly understood. METHODS: Exosomes isolated from media collected from cultured NPCE cells by differential ultracentrifugation were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS), and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), sucrose density gradient migration and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The cellular target specificity of the NPCE-derived exosomes was investigated by confocal microscopy-based monitoring of the uptake of DiD-labeled exosomes over time, as compared to uptake by various cell lines. Changes in Wnt protein levels in TM cells induced by NPCE exosomes were evaluated by Western blot. RESULTS: Exosomes derived from NPCE cells were purified and detected as small rounded 50-140 nm membrane vesicles, as defined by DLS, NTA, TRPS and TEM. Western blot analysis indicated that the nanovesicles were positive for classic exosome markers, including Tsg101 and Alix. Isolated nanoparticles were found in sucrose density fractions typical of exosomes (1.118-1.188 g/mL sucrose). Using confocal microscopy, we demonstrated time-dependent specific accumulation of the NPCE-derived exosomes in NTM cells. Other cell lines investigated hardly revealed any exosome uptake. We further showed that exosomes induced changes in Wnt signaling protein expression in the TM cells. Western blot analysis further revealed decreased phosphorylation of GKS3β and reduced β-catenin levels. Finally, we found that treatment of NTM cells with exosomes resulted in a greater than 2-fold decrease in the level of β-catenin in the cytosolic fraction. In contrast, no remarkable difference in the amount of β-catenin in the nuclear fraction was noted, relative to the control. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that NPCE cells release exosome-like vesicles and that these nanoparticles affect canonical Wnt signaling in TM cells. These findings may have therapeutic relevance since canonical Wnt pathway is involved in intra-ocular pressure regulation. Further understanding of NPCE-derived exosome-responsive signaling pathways may reveal new targets for pharmacological intervention within the drainage system as a target for glaucoma therapy.

Heat Shock Protein HSP27 Secretion by Ovarian Cancer Cells Is Linked to Intracellular Expression Levels, Occurs Independently of the Endoplasmic Reticulum Pathway and HSP27's Phosphorylation Status, and Is Mediated by Exosome Liberation.	Dis Markers	2017	The heat shock protein HSP27 has been correlated in ovarian cancer (OC) patients with aggressiveness and chemoresistance and, therefore, represents a promising potential biomarker for OC diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response. Notably, secretion of soluble HSP27 has been described by a few cell types and may take place as well in OC cells. Therefore, we studied HSP27 secretion mechanisms under diverse cellular conditions in an OC cell model system. Secretion of HSP27 was characterized after overexpression of HSP27 by transfected plasmids and after heat shock. Intra- and extracellular HSP27 amounts were assessed by Western blotting and ELISA. Protein secretion was blocked by brefeldin A and the impact of the HSP27 phosphorylation status was analyzed overexpressing HSP27 phosphomutants. The present study demonstrated that HSP27 secretion by OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3 cells depends on intracellular HSP27 concentrations. Moreover, HSP27 secretion is independent of the endoplasmic reticulum secretory pathway and HSP27 phosphorylation. Notably, analysis of OC cell-born exosomes not only confirmed the concentration-dependent correlation of HSP27 expression and secretion but also demonstrated a concentration-dependent incorporation of HSP27 protein into exosomes. Thus, secreted HSP27 may become more important as an extracellular factor which controls the tumor microenvironment and might be a noninvasive biomarker.	PMC5343262

Liposomal microparticle injection can induce myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC)-like cells in vivo.	Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol	2017	CONTEXT: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a subset of immature myeloid cells that function as immunosuppressive cells in various pathological conditions. Membrane-derived microvesicles are thought to be involved in MDSC induction. Earlier reports have described that injection of considerable amount of liposome into rat can suppress Con A-induced splenic T-cell proliferation. Liposome-internalized cells expressing CD11b/c suppress T-cell proliferation. Nitric oxide (NO) appears to be involved in the suppression. We speculated that, similarly to membrane-derived microvesicles, liposomal microparticles can induce MDSC-like cells in vivo. OBJECTIVES: To confirm our speculation we investigated dose-dependency of the suppressive effect, the effect of liposome on the induction of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and anti-CD3 antibody-stimulated T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liposome particles of 250 nm diameter were prepared and suspended in saline. Then, various amounts of liposomal suspension were injected intravenously into rats. After 24 h, rat spleens were removed and concanavalin A (or anti-CD3 antibody) stimulated-splenic T-cell proliferation and the production of iNOS, NO and cytokines were evaluated. RESULTS: T-cell proliferation was suppressed dose-dependently by liposome injection. The immunosuppressive cell exerts its suppressive activity in a dose-dependent manner. The suppression was eliminated by iNOS inhibitor. iNOS was detected in liposome-loaded splenocytes. Anti-CD3 antibody-stimulated T-cell proliferation was also inhibited. Enhanced production of IL-10 was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Liposomal microparticles can induce MDSC-like cells in vivo. The lipids which comprise liposomes might serve an important role in the induction of MDSCs in vivo.

Electronic address: .	tangjh@njmu.edu.cn		Predictive role of GSTP1-containing exosomes in chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer.	Gene	2017	Anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy regimens are usually used as neoadjuvant chemotherapies to decrease tumour size and prevent metastasis of advanced breast cancer. However, patients have a high risk of developing chemo-resistance during treatment through still unknown mechanisms. Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), which belongs to the family of phase II metabolic enzymes, has been reported to function in detoxifying several anti-cancer drugs by conjugating them with glutathione. Previous studies have identified GSTP1 as a predictor of prognosis and chemo-resistance in breast cancer patients, but the mechanisms governing GSTP1-dependent drug resistance are still unclear. We have found that GSTP1 expression is much higher in adriamycin-resistant cells and their corresponding exosomes. The role of GSTP1-containing exosomes in conferring drug resistance was analysed through cell apoptosis and immunofluorescence staining assays. Furthermore, we analysed 42 cases of paired breast cancer tissues collected before and after anthracycline/taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy by immunohistochemistry. Higher GSTP1 expression was shown in the progressive disease (PD)/stable disease (SD) group than in the partial response (PR)/complete response (CR) group both in the samples collected before and after the chemotherapy treatment. Interestingly, GSTP1 partly re-localized from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm upon treatment, and similar results were obtained for the exosomal marker Tumour susceptibility gene 101 protein (TSG101), which also increased in the cytoplasm after chemotherapy. After analysing the serum exosomes of 30 patients treated with anthracycline/taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we discovered that the levels of GSTP1 in exosomes from patients in the PD/SD group were significantly higher than those in the PR/CR group. Here, for the first time, we investigated a novel role for GSTP1-containing exosomes and their capability to transfer drug resistance and evaluated their clinical use in predicting chemo-resistance.

Characterization of mouse serum exosomal small RNA content: The origins and their roles in modulating inflammatory response.	Oncotarget	2017	In the last decade, although studies on exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from serum and other body fluids have increased dramatically; the contents and biological significance of serum exosomes under normal conditions remain unclear. In the present study, we profiled the small RNA content of mouse serum exosomes (mSEs) using small RNAseq and found that fragments of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and miRNAs were the two predominant exosomal RNA species, accounting for approximately 60% and 10% of mapped reads, respectively. Moreover, 466 known and 5 novel miRNAs were identified from two independent experiments, among which the five most abundant miRNAs (miR-486a-5p, miR-22-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-10b-5p and miR-27b-3p) accounted for approximately 60% of all the aligned miRNA sequences. As inferred from the identities of the well known cell- or tissue-specific miRNAs, mSEs were primarily released by RBCs, liver and intestinal cells. Bioinformatics analysis revealed over half of the top 20 miRNAs by abundance were involved in inflammatory responses and further in vitro experiments demonstrated that mSEs potently primed macrophages towards the M2 phenotype. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to profile small RNAs from mSEs. In addition to providing a reference for future biomarker studies and extrapolating their origins, our data also suggest the roles of mSEs in maintaining internal homeostasis under normal conditions.

Multiple extracellular vesicle types in peritoneal dialysis effluent are prominent and contain known biomarkers.	PLoS One	2017	Peritoneal dialysis inevitability results in activation of inflammatory processes and its efficiency is highly variable between patients. An improved method to isolate biomarkers and study pathophysiological mechanisms in peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE) is expected to be of much benefit for the development of this treatment approach and help with patient management. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released as part of normal cellular processes. Their proteome is expected to reflect both type and health of their cell of origin. Although there is a significant interest in using EVs for "liquid biopsies", little is reported of their presence or composition in plentiful dialysis waste fluids, including peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE). Here we determined the presence of EVs in PDE and subsequently characterized their proteome. EVs were first isolated from PDE using differential centrifugation, then a further enrichment using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed. The presence of EVs was demonstrated using transmission electron microscopy, and their particle counts were investigated using nanoparticle tracking analysis and dynamic light scattering. Using tandem mass spectrometry, marker proteins from three types of EVs i.e. apoptotic bodies, ectosomes, and exosomes were identified. The proteomic results demonstrated that the isolation of EVs by differential centrifugation helped enrich for over 2,000 proteins normally masked by abundant proteins in PDE such as albumin and SEC markedly further improved the isolation of low abundant proteins. Gene ontology analysis of all identified proteins showed the marked enrichment of exosome and membrane-associated proteins. Over 3,700 proteins were identified in total, including many proteins with known roles in peritoneal pathophysiology. This study demonstrated the prominence of EVs in PDE and their potential value as a source of biomarkers for peritoneal dialysis patients.	PMC5464591

Proteomic profiling of extracellular vesicles secreted from Toxoplasma gondii.	Proteomics	2017	Toxoplasma gondii infects a wide range of hosts worldwide, including humans and domesticated animals causing toxoplasmosis disease.

The effect of EVs derived from T. gondii on the immune response and its relevance in a physiological context is unknown. Here we disclose the first proteomic profiling of T. gondii EVs compared to EVs isolated from a human foreskin fibroblast infected cell line cultured in a vesicle-free medium. Our results reveal a broad range of canonical exosomes proteins. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD004895.

Sci Rep	2017	Communication between embryo and maternal endometrium occurs during a specific time frame in which implantation is possible. Here we demonstrate for the first time that conditioned media from non-manipulated human embryos cultured in vitro for 3 days or up to the blastocyst stage contain extracellular vesicles (EVs) with a diameter of 50 to 200 nm and bearing the traditional microvesicle and exosome marker proteins CD63, CD9 and ALIX. The embryonic origin of these EVs has been confirmed by the presence of stemness gene transcripts and their enrichment in the non-classical HLA-G protein. NANOG and POU5F1 transcripts were shown to be contained in vesicles deriving from embryos at different stages of development. In line with a higher detection rate of the HLA-G protein in blastocysts compared to cleavage stage embryos, a significantly higher amount of HLA-G was found in vesicles accumulated in spent media from day 3 to day 5 of development compared to those isolated from the earlier stage. Uptake of dye-labeled embryo-derived EVs by human primary endometrial epithelial and stromal cells was also demonstrated with a fluorescence intensity signal significantly higher for cells treated with vesicles derived from blastocysts. Based on these findings, EV exchange may be suggested as an emerging way of communication at the maternal-fetal interface.	PMC5507879

Biol Pharm Bull	2017	Exosomes are derived from various sources, including primary and cultured cell lines and body fluids. It is now evident that they are important for communication between cells. They have, therefore, been proposed as potential carriers to deliver drugs to specific sites. In this study, we examined stability of exosomes derived from human saliva. Exosomes were stored at 4°C for up to 20 months and their membrane integrity assessed. Several exosomal markers, such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV; membrane marker) and programmed cell death 6-interacting protein (Alix, lumen marker), were retained intact after 20 months storage at 4°C. Moreover, intact exosomes could be isolated from whole saliva that had been stored at 4°C. Membrane disruption with detergents such as Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40 caused partial solubilization of DPP IV and release of Alix into the supernatant. In contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment caused a complete disruption of the membrane. In addition, membrane stability was maintained after freezing and thawing. These results indicated that human saliva-derived exosomes are stable, maintaining their membrane integrity over a long storage period.

Onco Targets Ther	2017	Worldwide, gastric cancer (GC) is one of the deadliest malignant tumors of the digestive system. Moreover, microRNAs (miRNAs) of exosomes harbored within cancer cells have been determined to induce inflammatory conditions that accelerate tumor growth and metastasis. Interestingly, the oncogenic role of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in the modulation of immunosuppression, tumor invasion, and metastasis was discovered to be partly mediated through the secretion of exosomes. In this article, high expression of miRNA-221 (miR-221) in exosomes of the peripheral blood was determined to be positively correlated with the poor clinical prognosis of GC, especially with respect to tumor, node, and metastases stage. Therefore, the expression of miR-221 in exosomes of the peripheral blood may be an important detection index for GC. Proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion to the matrix of GC BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells were significantly enhanced by exosomes that originated from BM-MSCs that were transfected with miR-221 mimics. In conclusion, extracted exosomes from BM-MSCs transfected with miR-221 oligonucleotides can act as high-efficiency nanocarriers, which can provide sufficient miR-221 oligonucleotides to influence the tumor microenvironment and tumor aggressiveness effectively. Notably, the use of a miR-221 inhibitor with an excellent restraining effect in exosomes provides therapeutic potential for GC in future clinical medicine.	PMC5574589

Exosomes derived from bone marrow stromal cells decrease the sensitivity of leukemic cells to etoposide.	Oncol Lett	2017	The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of exosomes derived from bone marrow stromal cells (BM-SCs) on the chemoresistant characteristics of nalm-6 cells treated with etoposide (VP16). The present study isolated exosomes from BM-SC-conditioned medium by using standard differential centrifugation steps and detected the expression of 70 kilodalton heat shock proteins (HSP70) and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 3 (CD63) in exosomes by western blot analysis. Nalm-6 cells were co-cultured with exosomes in the presence of VP16. Cell viability and apoptosis were then detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 method and Annexin-V/propidium iodide, respectively. Finally, protein levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), BCL-2-like protein 4 (BAX), caspase-3, and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) were examined by western blot analysis. Exosomes were successfully isolated from the conditioned medium and confirmed by the expression of HSP70 and CD63. BM-SC-derived exosomes increased the viability of nalm-6 cells in the presence of VP16 and inhibited the apoptosis induced by VP16. Western blot analysis results showed that exosomes can block the significant reduction of BCL-2, full-length caspase-3 and full-length PARP, while preventing the increase of BAX, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP induced by VP16. Exosomes derived from BM-SCs can protect nalm-6 cells from VP16-induced apoptosis to maintain their survival and induce resistance to VP16. In addition, BCL-2/BAX, caspase-3, and PARP may be involved in the mechanism of exosome-induced drug resistance.	PMC5588151

Methods Mol Biol	2017	Exosomes are intercellular messengers with a high potential for diagnostic and therapeutic utility. It is believed that exosomes present in body fluids are responsible for providing signals which inhibit immune cells, interfere with antitumor immunity, and thus influence the response to treatment and its effect. One of the most interesting issues in exosome studies is proper addressing of their cargo composed of nucleic acids and proteins. Effective and selective isolation of extracellular vesicles and identification of proteins present in exosomes has turned out to be a challenging aspect of their exploration. Here we propose a novel approach that is based on isolation of exosomes by mini-size-exclusion chromatography which allows efficient, rapid, and reliable isolation of morphologically intact and functionally active exosomes without the need of ultracentrifugation. The purpose of this chapter is to describe a simple and high-throughput method to isolate, purify, and identify exosomal proteins using a mass spectrometry approach. The proposed protocol compiles the expertise of two research groups specialized in exosome research and in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The protocol combines differential centrifugation followed by ultrafiltration, centrifugation-based filtration, and gel filtration on Sepharose 2B in order to obtain exosomal fractions characterized by only low contamination with albumin.

J Cell Commun Signal	2018	Hepatocyte exosomes (ExoHep) are proposed to mediate physiological or pathophysiological signaling in a variety of hepatic target cells. ExoHep were purified from the medium of primary mouse hepatocytes or AML12 cells and characterized as ~100 nm nanovesicles that were positive for proteins commonly found in exosomes (CD9, CD81, flotillin) or hepatocytes (asialoglycoprotein receptor). Ethanol treatment of hepatocytes caused increased ExoHep release and increased cellular mRNA expression of components involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking (Rab 5a,b,c, Rab 7a, Rab 27a,b) or exosome biogenesis via the ESCRT (HGS, Alix, STAM1, TSG101, VTA1, YKT6) or ceramide (nSmase2) pathways. RNA interference of HGS, Alix, TSG101 or nSmase 2 caused exosome production by normal or ethanol-treated hepatocytes to be reduced. In mice, in vivo administration of fluorescently-labeled ExoHep resulted in their accumulation in the liver and preferential localization to hepatic stellate cells (HSC) or hepatocytes, the latter of which showed enhanced ExoHep binding when isolated from fibrotic mice. In cell co-cultures, the intercellular transfer of RNA from hepatocytes to hepatocytes or HSC was blocked by the exosome inhibitor GW4869. ExoHep binding to HSC or hepatocytes occurred via mechanisms that involved heparin-like molecules and cellular integrin αv or β1 subunits , and resulted in a reversal of fibrosis-associated gene expression in HSC and of ethanol-induced damage in hepatocytes. These studies provide insight regarding the regulation and/or participation of exosome biogenesis or trafficking components in hepatocytes and show that ExoHep can mediate therapeutic changes in activated HSC or injured hepatocytes that occur downstream of heparin- or integrin-dependent binding interactions.

BMC Cancer	2017	BACKGROUND: Circulating cell-free miRNAs have emerged as promising minimally-invasive biomarkers for early detection, prognosis and monitoring of cancer. They can exist in the bloodstream incorporated into extracellular vesicles (EVs) and ribonucleoprotein complexes. However, it is still debated if EVs contain biologically meaningful amounts of miRNAs and may provide a better source of miRNA biomarkers than whole plasma. The aim of this study was to systematically compare the diagnostic potential of prostate cancer-associated miRNAs in whole plasma and in plasma EVs. METHODS: RNA was isolated from whole plasma and plasma EV samples from a well characterised cohort of 50 patient with prostate cancer (PC) and 22 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Nine miRNAs known to have a diagnostic potential for PC in cell-free blood were quantified by RT-qPCR and the relative quantities were compared between patients with PC and BPH and between PC patients with Gleason score ≥ 8 and ≤6. RESULTS: Only a small fraction of the total cell-free miRNA was recovered from the plasma EVs, however the EV-incorporated and whole plasma cell-free miRNA profiles were clearly different. Four of the miRNAs analysed showed a diagnostic potential in our patient cohort. MiR-375 could differentiate between PC and BPH patients when analysed in the whole plasma, while miR-200c-3p and miR-21-5p performed better when analysed in plasma EVs. EV-incorporated but not whole plasma Let-7a-5p level could distinguish PC patients with Gleason score ≥ 8 vs ≤6. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that for some miRNA biomarkers EVs provide a more consistent source of RNA than whole plasma, while other miRNAs show better diagnostic performance when tested in the whole plasma.

Sci Rep	2017	Smoking is known to exacerbate HIV-1 pathogenesis, especially in monocytes, through the oxidative stress pathway. Exosomes are known to alter HIV-1 pathogenesis through inter-cellular communication. However, the role of exosomes in smoking-mediated HIV-1 pathogenesis is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) on the characteristics of monocyte-derived exosomes and their influence on HIV-1 replication. Initially, we demonstrated that CSC reduced total protein and antioxidant capacity in exosomes derived from HIV-1-infected and uninfected macrophages. The exosomes from CSC-treated uninfected cells showed a protective effect against cytotoxicity and viral replication in HIV-1-infected macrophages. However, exosomes derived from HIV-1-infected cells lost their protective capacity. The results suggest that the exosomal defense is likely to be more effective during the early phase of HIV-1 infection and diminishes at the latter phase. Furthermore, we showed CSC-mediated upregulation of catalase in exosomes from uninfected cells, with a decrease in the levels of catalase and PRDX6 in exosomes derived from HIV-1-infected cells. These results suggest a potential role of antioxidant enzymes, which are differentially packaged into CSC-exposed HIV-1-infected and uninfected cell-derived exosomes, on HIV-1 replication of recipient cells. Overall, our study suggests a novel role of exosomes in tobacco-mediated HIV-1 pathogenesis.	PMC5701054

Mol Ther	2018	Efficient transduction tools are a hallmark for both research and therapy development. Here, we introduce new insights into the generation of lentiviral vectors with improved performance by utilizing producer cells with increased production rates of extracellular vesicles through CD9 overexpression. Most human cells secrete small vesicles from their surface (microvesicles) or intraluminal endosome-derived membranes (exosomes). In particular, enhanced levels of the tetraspanin CD9 result in significantly increased numbers of extracellular vesicles with exosome-like features that were secreted from four different human cell lines. Intriguingly, exosomes and their biogenesis route display similarities to lentivirus and we examined the impact of CD9 expression on release and infectivity of recombinant lentiviral vectors. Although the titers of released viral particles were not increased upon production in high CD9 cells, we observed improved performance in terms of both speed and efficiency of lentiviral gene delivery into numerous human cell lines, including HEK293, HeLa, SH-SY5Y, as well as B and T lymphocytes. Here, we demonstrate that enhanced CD9 enables lentiviral transduction in the absence of any pseudotyping viral glycoprotein or fusogenic molecule. Our findings indicate an important role of CD9 for lentiviral vector and exosome biogenesis and point out a remarkable function of this tetraspanin in membrane fusion, viral infectivity, and exosome-mediated horizontal information transfer.

Intravenously delivered mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes target M2-type macrophages in the injured spinal cord.	PLoS One	2018	In a previous report we showed that intravenous infusion of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) improved functional recovery after contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) in the non-immunosuppressed rat, although the MSCs themselves were not detected at the spinal cord injury (SCI) site [1]. Rather, the MSCs lodged transiently in the lungs for about two days post-infusion. Preliminary studies and a recent report [2] suggest that the effects of intravenous (IV) infusion of MSCs could be mimicked by IV infusion of exosomes isolated from conditioned media of MSC cultures (MSCexos). In this study, we assessed the possible mechanism of MSCexos action on SCI by investigating the tissue distribution and cellular targeting of DiR fluorescent labeled MSCexos at 3 hours and 24 hours after IV infusion in rats with SCI. The IV delivered MSCexos were detected in contused regions of the spinal cord, but not in the noninjured region of the spinal cord, and were also detected in the spleen, which was notably reduced in weight in the SCI rat, compared to control animals. DiR "hotspots" were specifically associated with CD206-expressing M2 macrophages in the spinal cord and this was confirmed by co-localization with anti-CD63 antibodies labeling a tetraspanin characteristically expressed on exosomes. Our findings that MSCexos specifically target M2-type macrophages at the site of SCI, support the idea that extracellular vesicles, released by MSCs, may mediate at least some of the therapeutic effects of IV MSC administration.

Int Urol Nephrol	2018	PURPOSE: To assess a new and highly specific, but low-cost, easily performed and suitable for large-scale applications method for renal fibrosis (RF) diagnostics. METHODS: Thirty-five RF and twenty non-RF patients were enrolled in the study. An appropriate polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used to isolate urinary exosomes. The efficiency of isolation process was evaluated by the morphology and size observation, as well as the detection of specific markers (CD63, CD9). The expression level of exosomal miR-29c, miR-21 and the endogenous control snRNA-U6 were detected by qRT-PCR. The diagnostic potency of urinary exosomal miR-29c and miR-21 was estimated by the ROC method. Spearman's rank-order correlations analysis was used to assess the correlation between the miRNAs and clinical parameters, including pathological index. RESULTS: PEG-based method for isolation urinary exosome was effective and could be completed with a relatively low-speed centrifugal machine. Exosomal miR-29c and miR-21 were detected in all samples. The analysis of miRNAs in urinary exosomes revealed significant dys-regulation of miR-29c and miR-21 associated with RF. Exosomal miR-29c and miR-21 could predict degree of RF with AUC of 0.8333 and 0.7639 (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that the level of miR-29c had a significant negative relationship with eGFR and the interstitial relative area. CONCLUSIONS: The PEG-based method for isolation urinary exosome is an inexpensive and easily performed approach. The application for cargo miRNA analysis is feasible. Urinary exosomal miR-29c may present a promising diagnostic approach.

Cancer Biomark	2018	Exosomes are lipid bilayer vesicles of endocytic origin ranging from 30 to 100 nm in size, and contain various nucleic acid molecules such as DNA, mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA and multiple proteins, which could be transferred into target cells. Recent study indicated that exosomes as information carriers between cells has introduced us to a new previously unknown biological communication system. Increasing evidences show that exosomes play a crucial role in gastric cancer because they are potential to influence normal cellular physiology and promote various states of the cancer. In this review, we focus on the latest findings on exosomes in the plasma of gastric cancer patients, mainly summarizing the functions of miRNAs, lncRNAs and multiple proteins in diagnosis, prognosis, and in establishing treatment regimens against gastric cancer. Furtherly, potential functions of exosomes as novel diagnostic biomarkers for gastric cancer are discussed extensively. Exosomes are believed to be a non-invasive disease biomarker with a dual capability to provide insights into the early diagnosis for gastric cancer.

Simultaneous isolation and preconcentration of exosomes by ion concentration polarization.	Electrophoresis	2018	Exosomes carry microRNA biomarkers, occur in higher abundance in cancerous patients than in healthy ones, and because they are present in most biofluids, including blood and urine, these can be obtained noninvasively. Standard laboratory techniques to isolate exosomes are expensive, time consuming, provide poor purity, and recover on the order of 25% of the available exosomes. We present a new microfluidic technique to simultaneously isolate exosomes and preconcentrate them by electrophoresis using a high transverse local electric field generated by ion-depleting ion-selective membrane. We use pressure-driven flow to deliver an exosome sample to a microfluidic chip such that the transverse electric field forces them out of the cross flow and into an agarose gel which filters out unwanted cellular debris while the ion-selective membrane concentrates the exosomes through an enrichment effect. We efficiently isolated exosomes from 1× PBS buffer, cell culture media, and blood serum. Using flow rates from 150 to 200 μL/h and field strengths of 100 V/cm, we consistently captured between 60 and 80% of exosomes from buffer, cell culture media, and blood serum as confirmed by both fluorescence spectroscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Our microfluidic chip maintained this recovery rate for more than 20 min with a concentration factor of 15 for 10 min of isolation.

Matrix Biol	2018	Therapeutic approaches aimed at curing prostate cancer are only partially successful given the occurrence of highly metastatic resistant phenotypes that frequently develop in response to therapies. Recently, we have described αvβ6, a surface receptor of the integrin family as a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer; this epithelial-specific molecule is an ideal target since, unlike other integrins, it is found in different types of cancer but not in normal tissues. We describe a novel αvβ6-mediated signaling pathway that has profound effects on the microenvironment. We show that αvβ6 is transferred from cancer cells to monocytes, including β6-null monocytes, by exosomes and that monocytes from prostate cancer patients, but not from healthy volunteers, express αvβ6. Cancer cell exosomes, purified via density gradients, promote M2 polarization, whereas αvβ6 down-regulation in exosomes inhibits M2 polarization in recipient monocytes. Also, as evaluated by our proteomic analysis, αvβ6 down-regulation causes a significant increase in donor cancer cells, and their exosomes, of two molecules that have a tumor suppressive role, STAT1 and MX1/2. Finally, using the Ptenpc-/- prostate cancer mouse model, which carries a prostate epithelial-specific Pten deletion, we demonstrate that αvβ6 inhibition in vivo causes up-regulation of STAT1 in cancer cells. Our results provide evidence of a novel mechanism that regulates M2 polarization and prostate cancer progression through transfer of αvβ6 from cancer cells to monocytes through exosomes.

Epigenetic modifications in hyperhomocysteinemia: potential role in diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.	Oncotarget	2018	To study Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-induced epigenetic modifications as potential mechanisms of blood retinal barrier (BRB) dysfunction, retinas isolated from three- week-old mice with elevated level of Homocysteine (Hcy) due to lack of the enzyme cystathionine β-synthase (cbs-/- , cbs+/- and cbs+/+ ), human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs), and human retinal pigmented epithelial cells (ARPE-19) treated with or without Hcy were evaluated for (1) histone deacetylases (HDAC), (2) DNA methylation (DNMT), and (3) miRNA analysis. Differentially expressed miRNAs in mice with HHcy were further compared with miRNA analysis of diabetic mice retinas (STZ) and miRNAs within the exosomes released from Hcy-treated RPEs. Differentially expressed miRNAs were further evaluated for predicted target genes and associated pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. HHcy significantly increased HDAC and DNMT activity in HRECs, ARPE-19, and cbs mice retinas, whereas inhibition of HDAC and DNMT decreased Hcy-induced BRB dysfunction. MiRNA profiling detected 127 miRNAs in cbs+/- and 39 miRNAs in cbs-/- mice retinas, which were significantly differentially expressed compared to cbs+/+ . MiRNA pathway analysis showed their involvement in HDAC and DNMT activation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and oxidative stresses, inflammation, hypoxia, and angiogenesis pathways. Hcy-induced epigenetic modifications may be involved in retinopathies associated with HHcy, such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.	PMC5849155

Placenta	2018	INTRODUCTION: Placenta-derived exosomes may represent an additional pathway by which the placenta communicates with the maternal system to induce maternal vascular adaptations to pregnancy and it may be affected during Fetal growth restriction (FGR). The objective of this study was to quantify the concentration of total and placenta-derived exosomes in maternal and fetal circulation in small fetuses classified as FGR or small for gestational age (SGA). METHODS: Prospective cohort study in singleton term gestations including 10 normally grown fetuses and 20 small fetuses, sub-classified into SGA and FGR accordingly to birth weight (BW) percentile and fetoplacental Doppler. Exosomes were isolated from maternal and fetal plasma and characterized by morphology, enrichment of exosomal proteins, and size distribution by electron microscopy, western blot, and nanoparticle tracking analysis, respectively. Total and specific placenta-derived exosomes were determined using quantum dots coupled with CD63+ve and placental-type alkaline phosphatase (PLAP)+ve antibodies, respectively. RESULTS: Maternal concentrations of CD63+ve and PLAP+ve exosomes were similar between the groups (all p > 0.05). However, there was a significant positive correlation between the ratio of placental-derived to total exosomes (PLAP+ve ratio) and BW percentile, [rho = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.57 to 0.89); p = 0.0001]. The contribution of placental exosomes to the total exosome concentration in maternal and fetal circulation showed a significant decrease among cases, with lower PLAP+ve ratios in FGR compared to controls and SGA cases. DISCUSSION: Quantification of placental exosomes in maternal plasma reflects fetal growth and it may be a useful indicator of placental function.

Mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes ameliorate blue light stimulation in retinal pigment epithelium cells and retinal laser injury by VEGF-dependent mechanism.	Int J Ophthalmol	2018	AIM: To observe the effect of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in blue light injured human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in rats. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from hUCMSCs and characterized by transmission electron microscope and Western blot. MSCs-derived exosomes were cultured with RPE cells exposed to blue light. The mRNA and protein expression of VEGF-A were determined by real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot, respectively. Immunofluorescence assay was used for the detection of the expression level of VEGF-A. We injected different doses of MSCs-derived exosomes intravitreally to observe and compare their effects in a mouse model of laser-induced retinal injury. The histological structure of CNV in rats was inspected by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and fundus fluorescein angiography. The expression of VEGF-A was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Exosomes exhibited the typical characteristic morphology (cup-shaped) and size (diameter between 50 and 150 nm). The exosomes marker, CD63, and hUCMSCs marker, CD90, showed a robust presence. In vitro, MSCs-derived exosomes downregulated the mRNA(Exo-L: t=6.485, 7.959, 9.286; Exo-M: t=7.517, 10.170, 13.413; Exo-H: t=10.317, 12.234, 14.592, P<0.05) and protein (Exo-L: t=2.945, 4.477, 6.657; Exo-M: t=4.713, 6.421, 8.836; Exo-H: t=6.539, 12.194, 12.783; P<0.05) expression of VEGF-A in RPE cells after blue light stimulation. In vivo, we found that the MSCs-derived exosomes reduced damage, distinctly downregulated VEGF-A (Exo-H: t=0.957, 1.382; P<0.05), and gradually improved the histological structures of CNV for a better visual function (Exo-L: 0.346, Exo-M: 3.382, Exo-H: 8.571; P<0.05). CONCLUSION: MSCs-derived exosomes ameliorate blue light stimulation in RPE cells and laser-induced retinal injury via downregulation of VEGF-A.	PMC5902357

Adv Sci (Weinh)	2018	Targeted delivery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system to the receptor cells is essential for in vivo gene editing. Exosomes are intensively studied as a promising targeted drug delivery carrier recently, while limited by their low efficiency in encapsulating of large nucleic acids. Here, a kind of hybrid exosomes with liposomes is developed via simple incubation. Different from the original exosomes, the resultant hybrid nanoparticles efficiently encapsulate large plasmids, including the CRISPR-Cas9 expression vectors, similarly as the liposomes. Moreover, the resultant hybrid nanoparticles can be endocytosed by and express the encapsulated genes in the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which cannot be transfected by the liposome alone. Taken together, the exosome-liposome hybrid nanoparticles can deliver CRISPR-Cas9 system in MSCs and thus be promising in in vivo gene manipulation.	PMC5908366

Exosome-delivered microRNAs promote IFN-α secretion by human plasmacytoid DCs via TLR7.	JCI Insight	2018	The excessive production of type I IFNs is a hallmark and a main pathogenic mechanism of many autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In these pathologies, the sustained secretion of type I IFNs is dependent on the improper activation of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) by self-nucleic acids. However, the nature and origin of pDC-activating self-nucleic acids is still incompletely characterized. Here, we report that exosomes isolated from the plasma of SLE patients can activate the secretion of IFN-α by human blood pDCs in vitro. This activation requires endosomal acidification and is recapitulated by microRNAs isolated from exosomes, suggesting that exosome-delivered microRNAs act as self-ligands of innate single-stranded endosomal RNA sensors. By using synthetic microRNAs, we identified an IFN induction motif that is responsible for the TLR7-dependent activation, maturation, and survival of human pDCs. These findings identify exosome-delivered microRNAs as potentially novel TLR7 endogenous ligands able to induce pDC activation in SLE patients. Therefore, microRNAs may represent novel pathogenic mediators in the onset of autoimmune reactions and potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of type I IFN-mediated diseases.

Blood	2003	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles secreted by cells upon fusion of multivesicular endosomes with the cell surface. The mechanisms underlying the specific sorting of proteins in exosomal membranes are far from being unraveled. We demonstrate here, using different cells, that some molecules are released in the extracellular medium via their association with lipid raft domains of the exosomal membrane. Various typical raft-associated molecules could be detected by immunoblot in exosomes and Triton X-100-insoluble fractions isolated from exosomes of different origins. Partial localization of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules with detergent-resistant fractions isolated from Daudi-secreted exosomes was demonstrated by immunoblot and confirmed by electron microscopy colocalization of MHC class II molecules and ganglioside GM1. Moreover, we found that exosome-associated Lyn (1) had a lower molecular weight compared with Lyn detected in cell-isolated detergent-resistant domains, (2) was absent from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction isolated from exosomes, and (3) had lost its partitioning capacity in Triton X-114. Exosomal Lyn is probably cleaved by a caspase-3-like activity contained in secreted vesicles. All together, the data highlight the presence of lipid microdomains in exosomal membranes and suggest their participation in vesicle formation and structure, as well as the direct implication of exosomes in regulatory mechanisms.

Potocytosis and cellular exit of complexes as cellular pathways for gene delivery by polycations.	J Gene Med	2005	BACKGROUND: Although polycations are among the most efficient nonviral vectors for gene transfer, the gene expression they allow is still too low for in vivo applications. To engineer more potent polycationic vectors, the factors governing the intracellular trafficking of a plasmid complexed with current polycations need to be identified. METHODS AND RESULTS: The trafficking of plasmid DNA complexed to glycosylated polylysines or polyethylenimine (PEI) derivatives was studied by electron microscopy of human airway epithelial cells. The cellular processing of complexes varied with their size and the polycation derivative used: large complexes (> 200 nm) made with all polycationic vectors studied were internalized by macropinocytosis. In contrast, intermediate (100-200 nm) ligand-coupled polylysine and PEI complexes primarily entered through clathrin-coated pits. Complexes were then found in endosomal vesicles, accumulated in lysosomes or vesicles near the nucleus and their nuclear entry was limited. For the population of small complexes (< or = 100 nm) obtained with PEI derivatives, they were internalized through caveolae and pursued a traffic pattern of potocytosis to the endoplasmic reticulum where their fate remains unclear. Finally, some complexes exited the cells either by regurgitation when PEI derivatives were used or through an exosome-like pathway for glycosylated-polylysine complexes. CONCLUSIONS: The different pathways of complex trafficking observed in relation with complex size imply the development and study of vectors forming complexes with definite size. Moreover, the complex exit we describe may contribute to the well-established short-term efficiency of gene transfer based on synthetic vectors. It favors the engineering of vectors allowing repeated treatment.

The role of the VPS4A-exosome pathway in the intrinsic egress route of a DNA-binding anticancer drug.	Pharm Res	2006	PURPOSE: This study investigates the subcellular pharmacokinetics of drug efflux in cancer cells and explores the role of the multivesicular body (MVB) in facilitating efflux of doxorubicin, a widely used DNA-targeting anticancer agent, from the nucleus. METHODS: Human erythroleukemic K562 cells were pulsed with doxorubicin and then chased in drug-free media to allow for efflux. Microscopy and biochemical techniques were used to visualize the subcellular localization of the drug and measure drug content and distribution during the efflux period. To explore the role of the MVB in doxorubicin efflux, K562 cells were transfected with dominant negative mutant forms of VPS4a-GFP chimeras. RESULTS: Although the intracellular concentration of drug exceeds the extracellular concentration, nuclear efflux of doxorubicin occurs in living cells at a faster rate than doxorubicin unbinding from isolated nuclei into drug-free buffer. In cells expressing dominant negative VPS4a, doxorubicin accumulates in VPS4a-positive vesicles and drug sequestration is inhibited, directly implicating the MVB pathway in the egress route of doxorubicin in this cell type. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular membranes are a component of the doxorubicin efflux mechanism in K562 cells. Dominant-negative GFP chimeric mutants can be used to elucidate the role of specific membrane trafficking pathways in subcellular drug transport routes.

Nonclassical IL-1 beta secretion stimulated by P2X7 receptors is dependent on inflammasome activation and correlated with exosome release in murine macrophages.	J Immunol	2007	Several mechanistically distinct models of nonclassical secretion, including exocytosis of secretory lysosomes, shedding of plasma membrane microvesicles, and direct efflux through plasma membrane transporters, have been proposed to explain the rapid export of caspase-1-processed IL-1 beta from monocytes/macrophages in response to activation of P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) by extracellular ATP. We compared the contribution of these mechanisms to P2X7R-stimulated IL-1 beta secretion in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from wild-type, P2X7R knockout, or apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal CARD knockout mice. Our experiments revealed the following: 1) a novel correlation between IL-1 beta secretion and the release of the MHC-II membrane protein, which is a marker of plasma membranes, recycling endosomes, multivesicular bodies, and released exosomes; 2) a common and absolute requirement for inflammasome assembly and active caspase-1 in triggering the cotemporal export of IL-1 beta and MHC-II; and 3) mechanistic dissociation of IL-1 beta export from either secretory lysosome exocytosis or plasma membrane microvesicle shedding on the basis of different requirements for extracellular Ca(2+) and differential sensitivity to pharmacological agents that block activation of caspase-1 inflammasomes. Thus, neither secretory lysosome exocytosis nor microvesicle shedding models constitute the major pathways for nonclassical IL-1 beta secretion from ATP-stimulated murine macrophages. Our findings suggest an alternative model of IL-1 beta release that may involve the P2X7R-induced formation of multivesicular bodies that contain exosomes with entrapped IL-1 beta, caspase-1, and other inflammasome components.

Toxicon	2008	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (30-100 nm) with an endosome-derived limiting membrane that are secreted by a diverse range of cell types. We provide here the first evidence for the presence of exosome-like vesicles in snake venom. We isolated vesicles from fresh venom from Gloydius blomhoffii blomhoffii by gel-filtration. We found that the vesicles showed a typical exosome-like size and morphology as analyzed by electron microscopy. We observed that the vesicles contained dipeptidyl peptidase IV, aminopeptidase A, ecto-5'-nucleotidase and actin. Vesicle preparations truncated bioactive peptides such as angiotensin II, substance P, cholecystokinin-octapeptide, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1. The role of these vesicles is still unknown, but they may affect blood pressure and glucose homeostasis following envenomation.

J Transl Med	2009	BACKGROUND: Recently, nanometer sized vesicles (termed exosomes) have been described as a component of urine. Such vesicles may be a useful non-invasive source of markers in renal disease. Their utility as a source of markers in urological cancer remains unstudied. Our aim in this study was to investigate the feasibility and value of analysing urinary exosomes in prostate cancer patients undergoing standard therapy. METHODS: Ten patients (with locally advanced PCa) provided spot urine specimens at three time points during standard therapy. Patients received 3-6 months neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy prior to radical radiotherapy, comprising a single phase delivering 55 Gy in 20 fractions to the prostate and 44 Gy in 20 fractions to the pelvic nodes. Patients were continued on adjuvant ADT according to clinical need. Exosomes were purified, and the phenotype compared to exosomes isolated from the prostate cancer cell line LNcaP. A control group of 10 healthy donors was included. Serum PSA was used as a surrogate treatment response marker. Exosomes present in urine were quantified, and expression of prostate markers (PSA and PSMA) and tumour-associated marker 5T4 was examined. RESULTS: The quantity and quality of exosomes present in urine was highly variable, even though we handled all materials freshly and used methods optimized for obtaining highly pure exosomes. There was approx 2-fold decrease in urinary exosome content following 12 weeks ADT, but this was not sustained during radiotherapy. Nevertheless, PSA and PSMA were present in 20 of 24 PCa specimens, and not detected in healthy donor specimens. There was a clear treatment-related decrease in exosomal prostate markers in 1 (of 8) patient. CONCLUSION: Evaluating urinary-exosomes remains difficult, given the variability of exosomes in urine specimens. Nevertheless, this approach holds promise as a non-invasive source of multiple markers of malignancy that could provide clinically useful information.	PMC2631476

Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol	2009	Some extracellular-signaling peptides also at times function within the intracellular space. We have termed these peptides intracrines and have argued that intracrine function is associated with a wide variety of peptides/proteins including hormones, growth factors, cytokines, enzymes, and DNA-binding proteins among others. Here we consider the possibility that intracrines participate in the related phenomena of senescence, apoptosis, and stem cell regulation of tissue biology. Based on this analysis, we also suggest that the concept of intracrine action be expanded to include possible regulatory peptide transfer via exosomes/microvesicles and possibly by nanotubes. Moreover, the process of microvesicular and nanotube transfer of peptides and other biologically relevant molecules, which we inclusively term laterality, is explored. These notions have potentially important therapeutic implications, including implications for the therapy of cardiovascular disease.	PMC2755987
20304794	D Michiel Pegtel	Department of Pathology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit University Medical Center, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 	d.pegtel@vumc.nl		Functional delivery of viral miRNAs via exosomes.	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2010	Noncoding regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) of cellular and viral origin control gene expression by repressing the translation of mRNAs into protein. Interestingly, miRNAs are secreted actively through small vesicles called "exosomes" that protect them from degradation by RNases, suggesting that these miRNAs may function outside the cell in which they were produced. Here we demonstrate that miRNAs secreted by EBV-infected cells are transferred to and act in uninfected recipient cells. Using a quantitative RT-PCR approach, we demonstrate that mature EBV-encoded miRNAs are secreted by EBV-infected B cells through exosomes. These EBV-miRNAs are functional because internalization of exosomes by MoDC results in a dose-dependent, miRNA-mediated repression of confirmed EBV target genes, including CXCL11/ITAC, an immunoregulatory gene down-regulated in primary EBV-associated lymphomas. We demonstrate that throughout coculture of EBV-infected B cells EBV-miRNAs accumulate in noninfected neighboring MoDC and show that this accumulation is mediated by transfer of exosomes. Thus, the exogenous EBV-miRNAs transferred through exosomes are delivered to subcellular sites of gene repression in recipient cells. Finally, we show in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with increased EBV load that, although EBV DNA is restricted to the circulating B-cell population, EBV BART miRNAs are present in both B-cell and non-B-cell fractions, suggestive of miRNA transfer. Taken together our findings are consistent with miRNA-mediated gene silencing as a potential mechanism of intercellular communication between cells of the immune system that may be exploited by the persistent human gamma-herpesvirus EBV.

Transmission of circulating cell-free AA amyloid oligomers in exosomes vectors via a prion-like mechanism.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2010	Recent studies clearly demonstrated that several types of pathogenic amyloid proteins acted as agents that could transmit amyloidosis by means of a prion-like mechanism. Systemic AA amyloidosis is one of the most severe complications of chronic inflammatory disorders, particularly rheumatoid arthritis. It is well known that, similar to an infectious prion protein, amyloid-enhancing factor (AEF) acts as a transmissible agent in AA amyloidosis. However, how AEF transmits AA amyloidosis in vivo remained to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we focused on finding cell-free forms of AEF and its carriers in circulation by using the murine transfer model of AA amyloidosis. We first determined that circulating cell-free AEF existed in blood and plasma in mice with systemic AA amyloidosis. Second, we established that plasma exosomes containing AA amyloid oligomers derived from serum amyloid A had AEF activity and could transmit systemic AA amyloidosis via a prion-like mechanism. These novel findings should provide insights into the transmission mechanism of systemic amyloidoses.

Exosomes communicate protective messages during oxidative stress; possible role of exosomal shuttle RNA.	PLoS One	2010	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are small extracellular nanovesicles of endocytic origin that mediate different signals between cells, by surface interactions and by shuttling functional RNA from one cell to another. Exosomes are released by many cells including mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, epithelial cells and tumour cells. Exosomes differ compared to their donor cells, not only in size, but also in their RNA, protein and lipid composition. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we show that exosomes, released by mouse mast cells exposed to oxidative stress, differ in their mRNA content. Also, we show that these exosomes can influence the response of other cells to oxidative stress by providing recipient cells with a resistance against oxidative stress, observed as an attenuated loss of cell viability. Furthermore, Affymetrix microarray analysis revealed that the exosomal mRNA content not only differs between exosomes and donor cells, but also between exosomes derived from cells grown under different conditions; oxidative stress and normal conditions. Finally, we also show that exposure to UV-light affects the biological functions associated with exosomes released under oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results argue that the exosomal shuttle of RNA is involved in cell-to-cell communication, by influencing the response of recipient cells to an external stress stimulus.

A combination of exosomes carrying TSA derived from HLA-A2-positive human white buffy coat and polyI:C for use as a subcellular antitumor vaccination.	J Immunoassay Immunochem	2011	To improve its antitumor effect, we used human leukocyte antigen -A2 (HLA-A2)-positive human dendritic cell (DC)-derived DEXs (DC-derived exosomes) to support NY-ESO-1 antigen and polyI:C, with the aim of increasing the proliferation of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in transgenic mice. Mature dendritic cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from the blood of healthy adults with positive HLA-2A. Using centrifuge and membrane ultrafiltration, EXO (exosomes) were extracted from the supernatant of DCs secretions. Transgenic C57 mice were immunized with human-derived tumor testis antigen NY-ESO-1/EXO, with or without polyI:C. Mice were sacrificed four weeks after immunization, and spleen cells were isolated and tested for function. The experiments included antigen-specific CTL proliferation, as tested by dimerization and antitumor effects for K562 cells as well as melanoma, tested at different ratios of effected cells:target cells (0:1, 10:1, 50:1, and 100:1). Dimerization experiments indicated that the effect of DEX/TSA (tumor specific antigens) + PolyI:C was 2.36 ± 1.10% and the control was 0.38 ± 0.31%, while the effect of DEX/TSA was 1.97 ± 0.63% and the control was 0.36 ± 0.07%. Antitumor effects by DEX/TSA: PolyI:C for the cell ratios of 0:1, 10:1, 50:1, and 100:1 were 11.14 ± 1.36%, 14.17 ± 0.62%, 15.71 ± 2.48%, and 24.31 ± 2.91%, respectively, for K562 cells. The antitumor effects for DEX/TSA for the cell ratios of 0:1, 10:1, 50:1, and 100:1 were 12.23 ± 2.25%, 13.10 ± 1.57%, 15.27 ± 2.93%, and 19.87 ± 2.72%, respectively, for K562 cells. With ratios of 10:1 and 100:1, the antitumor effects of DEX/TSA + PolyI:C were better than for the DEX/TSA group (P < 0.05). However, higher ratios of effecter cells to target cells increased, and there were no significant improvements in antitumor effect for control cells. Combining PolyI:C with DEX/TSA derived from healthy human blood positive for HLA-A2 is a promising strategy for developing new subcellular antitumor vaccination.

J Thromb Haemost	2011	BACKGROUND: Platelet microparticles (PMPs) are a promising prognostic marker for thrombotic disorders because of their release during platelet activation. The use of flow cytometry for the enumeration of PMPs in plasma has generated controversy due to their size, which is below the stated detection limits of conventional flow cytometry instruments. The potential impact of this is an underestimation of PMP counts. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: To address this possibility, we used a combination of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the size distribution of PMPs present in plasma from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients and normal volunteers, and PMPs generated by expired platelet concentrates and washed platelets treated with agonists such as thrombin and calcium ionophore (A23187). RESULTS: According to AFM image analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in height or volume distributions in PMPs from thrombin-activated, calcium ionophore-activated, expired platelet concentrates and plasma from healthy volunteers and AMI patients. Based on volume, expired platelets released the greatest proportion of exosomes (< 1.0 × 10(-22) L(3) in volume) in relation to the entire PMP population (29.7%) and the smallest proportion of exosomes was observed in AMI patient plasma (1.8%). Moreover, AFM imaging revealed that PMPs from expired platelets exhibited smooth surfaces compared with other PMP types but this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that flow cytometry is capable of analyzing PMPs from plasma by using AFM to perform nanoscale measurements of individual PMP events isolated by FACS. This method also provided the first quantitative nanoscale images of PMP ultrastructure.

Infect Immun	2012	This study describes a novel immunization strategy against avian coccidiosis using exosomes derived from Eimeria parasite antigen (Ag)-loaded dendritic cells (DCs). Chicken intestinal DCs were isolated and pulsed in vitro with a mixture of sporozoite-extracted Ags from Eimeria tenella, E. maxima, and E. acervulina, and the cell-derived exosomes were isolated. Chickens were nonimmunized or immunized intramuscularly with exosomes and subsequently noninfected or coinfected with E. tenella, E. maxima, and E. acervulina oocysts. Immune parameters compared among the nonimmunized/noninfected, nonimmunized/infected, and immunized/infected groups were the numbers of cells secreting T(h)1 cytokines, T(h)2 cytokines, interleukin-16 (IL-16), and Ag-reactive antibodies in vitro and in vivo readouts of protective immunity against Eimeria infection. Cecal tonsils, Peyer's patches, and spleens of immunized and infected chickens had increased numbers of cells secreting the IL-16 and the T(h)1 cytokines IL-2 and gamma interferon, greater Ag-stimulated proliferative responses, and higher numbers of Ag-reactive IgG- and IgA-producing cells following in vitro stimulation with the sporozoite Ags compared with the nonimmunized/noninfected and nonimmunized/infected controls. In contrast, the numbers of cells secreting the T(h)2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 were diminished in immunized and infected chickens compared with the nonimmunized/noninfected and the nonimmunized/infected controls. Chickens immunized with Ag-loaded exosomes and infected in vivo with Eimeria oocysts had increased body weight gains, reduced feed conversion ratios, diminished fecal oocyst shedding, lessened intestinal lesion scores, and reduced mortality compared with the nonimmunized/infected controls. These results suggest that successful field vaccination against avian coccidiosis using exosomes derived from DCs incubated with Ags isolated from Eimeria species may be possible.	PMC3347461

Possible role of exosomes containing RNA in mediating nontargeted effect of ionizing radiation.	Radiat Res	2012	Communication between irradiated and un-irradiated (bystander) cells can cause damage in cells that are not directly targeted by ionizing radiation, a process known as the bystander effect. Bystander effects can also lead to chromosomal/genomic instability within the progeny of bystander cells, similar to the progeny of directly irradiated cells. The factors that mediate this cellular communication can be transferred between cells via gap junctions or released into the extracellular media following irradiation, but their nature has not been fully characterized. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the bystander effect mediator contains an RNA molecule that may be carried by exosomes. MCF7 cells were irradiated with 2 Gy of X rays and the extracellular media was harvested. RNase treatment abrogated the ability of the media to induce early and late chromosomal damage in bystander cells. Furthermore, treatment of bystander cells with exosomes isolated from this media increased the levels of genomic damage. These results suggest that the bystander effect, and genomic instability, are at least in part mediated by exosomes and implicate a role for RNA.

A translational study of urine miRNAs in acute myocardial infarction.	J Mol Cell Cardiol	2012	The currently used biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are blood creatinine phosphokinase-muscle band (CPK-MB), troponin-T (TnT), and troponin I (TnI). However, no good biomarkers are identified in urine after AMI, because these blood protein biomarkers are difficult to be filtered into urine. In this study, the role of urine microRNAs in the diagnosis of AMI and the mechanism involved were determined. We found that urine miR-1 was quickly increased in rats after AMI with peak at 24h after AMI, in which an over 50-fold increase was demonstrated. At 7 days after AMI, the urine miR-1 level was returned to the basal level. No miR-208 was found in normal urine. In urine from rats with AMI, miR-208 was easily detected. To determine the mechanism involved, we determined the levels of heart-released miR-1 in the liver, spleen and kidney after AMI in rats and found that the kidney was an important metabolic organ. To determine the renal elimination of blood miRNAs, we isolated serum exosomes from rats after AMI and injected these exosomes into the circulating blood of normal rats. We found that the urine miR-1 was significantly increased in exosome-injected animals. Moreover, PKH67-labeled exosomes injected into circulating blood could enter into the kidney tissues and cells, as well as urine. Furthermore, the levels of urine miR-1 were significantly increased in patients with AMI. The results suggest that urine miRNAs such as miR-1 could be novel urine biomarkers for AMI.	PMC4492106

Nat Protoc	2012	The use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to induce gene silencing has opened a new avenue in drug discovery. However, their therapeutic potential is hampered by inadequate tissue-specific delivery. Exosomes are promising tools for drug delivery across different biological barriers. Here we show how exosomes derived from cultured cells can be harnessed for delivery of siRNA in vitro and in vivo. This protocol first describes the generation of targeted exosomes through transfection of an expression vector, comprising an exosomal protein fused with a peptide ligand. Next, we explain how to purify and characterize exosomes from transfected cell supernatant. Next, we detail crucial steps for loading siRNA into exosomes. Finally, we outline how to use exosomes to efficiently deliver siRNA in vitro and in vivo in mouse brain. Examples of anticipated results in which exosome-mediated siRNA delivery is evaluated by functional assays and imaging are also provided. The entire protocol takes ~3 weeks.

J Proteomics	2013	Milk protein expression in healthy cows and cows with mastitis will provide information important for the dairy food industry and immune function in the mammary gland. To facilitate protein discovery, milk was fractioned into whey, milk fat globule membranes (MFGM) and exosomes from healthy and Staphylococcus aureus infected cows. Amine-reactive isobaric tags (iTRAQ) were used to quantify protein changes between milk fractions isolated from healthy and S. aureus infected cows. 2971 milk proteins were identified with a false discovery rate of 0.1%. Greater than 300 milk proteins associated with host defense were identified and 94 were significantly differentially regulated in S. aureus infected milk compared to their uninfected controls. These differentially regulated host defense proteins were selectively segregated in the 3 milk compartments examined. An example of this segregation of host defense proteins was the partitioning and high concentration of proteins indicative of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in the MFGM preparations from S. aureus infected milk as compared to exosomes or whey. Protein composition changes found in milk exosomes, MFGM and whey during an infection provides new and comprehensive information on milk protein composition in general as well as changes occurring during an infection. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The significance of this study is the identification and quantification of the individual components of the neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) functional proteome in an apparent stable complex with MFGM and/or milk fat globules during an intra-mammary infection. NETs could be functionally relevant in intra-mammary infection, as it is known that during an infection neutrophils ingest large amounts of milk fat that down regulates many of their traditional immune functions. Thus the presence of NETs in milk fat provides new insights to mammary immune function and suggests a role for NETs in clinical mastitis. These in vivo NETs can now be tested to determine if they retain functional antimicrobial activity when primarily associated with milk fat. Then we can estimate their real world functional relevance during an intra-mammary infection, which is one key to understanding clinical mastitis in dairy cows.

The 786-0 renal cancer cell-derived exosomes promote angiogenesis by downregulating the expression of hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule.	Mol Med Rep	2013	The aims of the current study were to determine whether 786‑0 renal cancer cell‑derived exosomes promote human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to form tubular structures and to uncover the underlying mechanisms associated with this process. Exosomes were extracted and purified using ultrafiltration and sucrose gradient centrifugation and characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Tubular structure formation was observed using the matrigel tubular assay. In addition, an adenovirus vector was used to transfect the hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule (hepaCAM) gene into renal cancer 786‑0 cells. The expression of hepaCAM and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and protein was determined by reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Tumor cell‑derived exosomes were observed to significantly increase tubular formation in HUVECs. Following transfection with the hepaCAM gene, VEGF expression in 786‑0 cells was markedly decreased. In HUVECs, exosome treatment increased VEGF mRNA and protein expression, while hepaCAM expression was only decreased at the protein level. In the present study, renal cancer 786‑0 cell‑derived exosomes significantly promoted angiogenesis via upregulation of VEGF expression in HUVECs, which may be induced by the downregulation of hepaCAM.

To clarify the mechanism of cerebral folate transport at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, we investigate the transport of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in polarized cells. Here we identify folate receptor-α-positive intralumenal vesicles within multivesicular bodies and demonstrate the directional cotransport of human folate receptor-α, and labelled folate from the basolateral to the apical membrane in rat choroid plexus cells. Both the apical medium of folate receptor-α-transfected rat choroid plexus cells and human cerebrospinal fluid contain folate receptor-α-positive exosomes. Loss of folate receptor-α-expressing cerebrospinal fluid exosomes correlates with severely reduced 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentration, corroborating the importance of the folate receptor-α-mediated folate transport in the cerebrospinal fluid. Intraventricular injections of folate receptor-α-positive and -negative exosomes into mouse brains demonstrate folate receptor-α-dependent delivery of exosomes into the brain parenchyma. Our results unravel a new pathway of folate receptor-α-dependent exosome-mediated folate delivery into the brain parenchyma and opens new avenues for cerebral drug targeting.

J Extracell Vesicles	2012	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in cell-to-cell communication. Although there are different kinds of vesicles, each with their own secretion and capture biology, all of them carry a cargo of proteins, lipids, metabolites and nucleic acids. They act as vehicles for exchange of biological materials and signals and are involved in the regulation of various physiological processes. Liver is an essential organ containing different cell populations fulfilling various functions, which need to be strictly controlled and coordinated. There are a few articles showing the role of liver-derived EVs. On the basis of them, we present here a hypothesis of the implication of such vesicles in the physiology of the liver. Different liver cell types, including hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and stellate cells, secrete and capture EVs and interact with them. Liver injury changes the abundance and cargo of EVs; these changes are likely to be important for the outcome of stress response. Although a substantial effort has been put into the characterization of EVs in isolated populations, it is only recently that some more comprehensive information has begun to appear. In this article, we hypothesize about the role of EVs in liver microenvironment and their possible function using published data from both hepatic and non-hepatic systems.	PMC3760641

Exosomes derived from Rab27a‑overexpressing tumor cells elicit efficient induction of antitumor immunity.	Mol Med Rep	2013	Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, there is a lack of effective therapeutic strategies. Currently, tumor immunotherapy based on exosomes, which are secreted by a variety of cell types including tumor cells, has drawn particular attention and are suggested to have the potential for exploitation in tumor therapy. Nevertheless, the therapeutic efficacy mediated via tumor cell-derived exosomes is not satisfactory. Rab27a, one of the Rab family of small GTPases, has been suggested to be important in exosome secretion. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine whether exosomes derived from Rab27a‑overexpressing cells elicited more potent antitumor immunity. A Rab27a‑overexpressing line was established via transfection of a Rab27a overexpression vector into the human non-small-cell lung cancer cell line, A549. Exosomes were isolated and the typical exosomal protein markers, CD9, CD63, heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 and Hsp90, were found to be enriched in the exosomes derived from Rab27a‑overexpressing cells. Subsequently, these exosomes were demonstrated to be capable of upregulating major histocompatibility complex class II molecules as well as the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on dendritic cells (DCs), suggesting that more potent maturation of DCs was induced. Furthermore, DCs loaded with exosomes derived from Rab27-overexpressing cells significantly promoted CD4+ T cell proliferation in vitro. In addition, in vivo immunization of exosomes derived from Rab27a‑overexpressing cells inhibited tumor growth in a mouse model. It was also demonstrated that splenocytes from mice immunized with exosomes derived from Rab27-overexpressing cells expressed high levels of type I cytokines, including IL-2 and IFN-γ, which are important in the regulation of cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Collectively, it was demonstrated that exosomes derived from Rab27a‑overexpressing cancer cells elicited more potent antitumor immune effects, which may provide novel insights for the development of efficient exosome-based cancer vaccines.	
24336651	S Russ Price	Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia;			miR-23a is decreased during muscle atrophy by a mechanism that includes calcineurin signaling and exosome-mediated export.	Am J Physiol Cell Physiol	2014	Skeletal muscle atrophy is prevalent in chronic diseases, and microRNAs (miRs) may play a key role in the wasting process. miR-23a was previously shown to inhibit the expression of atrogin-1 and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1) in muscle. It also was reported to be regulated by cytoplasmic nuclear factor of activated T cells 3 (NFATc3) in cardiomyocytes. The objective of this study was to determine if miR-23a is regulated during muscle atrophy and to evaluate the relationship between calcineurin (Cn)/NFAT signaling and miR-23a expression in skeletal muscle cells during atrophy. miR-23a was decreased in the gastrocnemius of rats with acute streptozotocin-induced diabetes, a condition known to increase atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression and cause atrophy. Treatment of C2C12 myotubes with dexamethasone (Dex) for 48 h also reduced miR-23a as well as RCAN1.4 mRNA, which is transcriptionally regulated by NFAT. NFATc3 nuclear localization and the amount of miR-23a decreased rapidly within 1 h of Dex administration, suggesting a link between Cn signaling and miR-23a. The level of miR-23a was lower in primary myotubes from mice lacking the α- or β-isoform of the CnA catalytic subunit than wild-type mice. Dex did not further suppress miR-23a in myotubes from Cn-deficient mice. Overexpression of CnAβ in C2C12 myotubes prevented Dex-induced suppression of miR-23a. Finally, miR-23a was present in exosomes isolated from the media of C2C12 myotubes, and Dex increased its exosomal abundance. Dex did not alter the number of exosomes released into the media. We conclude that atrophy-inducing conditions downregulate miR-23a in muscle by mechanisms involving attenuated Cn/NFAT signaling and selective packaging into exosomes.	PMC3948973

Transfer and functional consequences of dietary microRNAs in vertebrates: concepts in search of corroboration: negative results challenge the hypothesis that dietary xenomiRs cross the gut and regulate genes in ingesting vertebrates, but important questions persist.	Bioessays	2014	If validated, diet-derived foreign microRNA absorption and function in consuming vertebrates would drastically alter our understanding of nutrition and ecology. RNA interference (RNAi) mechanisms of Caenorhabditis elegans are enhanced by uptake of environmental RNA and amplification and systemic distribution of RNAi effectors. Therapeutic exploitation of RNAi in treating human disease is difficult because these accessory processes are absent or diminished in most animals. A recent report challenged multiple paradigms, suggesting that ingested microRNAs (miRNAs) are transferred to blood, accumulate in tissues, and exert canonical regulation of endogenous transcripts. Independent replication of these findings has been elusive, and multiple disconfirmatory findings have been published. In the face of mounting negative results, any additional positive reports must provide the proverbial "extraordinary proof" to support such claims. In this article, we review the evidence for and against a significant role for dietary miRNAs in influencing gene expression, and make recommendations for future studies.

The proteomics of prostate cancer exosomes.	Expert Rev Proteomics	2014	Exosomes and other microvesicles are emerging as rich reservoirs of tumor-specific proteins and biomarkers for cancer detection and progression. For prostate cancer, exosomes secreted by the prostate can be isolated from prostatic secretions, seminal fluid, tissue, urine or blood for further proteomic analysis. Structurally, prostate-derived exosomes are distinct in size, membrane composition and specific prostate protein content, potentially providing a novel and easily isolatable source of biomarkers from clinical biofluids. The key to these isolation strategies will be the targeting of specific prostatic proteins expressed in these exosomes, thus requiring detailed proteomic characterizations. A summary of ongoing efforts to characterize the proteome of these unique prostate cancer-associated exosomes and their potential applications for use in biomarker assays is presented.

Electronic address: .	c.jimenez@vumc.nl		Proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid extracellular vesicles: a comprehensive dataset.	J Proteomics	2014	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are present in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), yet little is known about their protein composition. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the proteome of CSF EVs by electron microscopy and high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in conjunction with bioinformatics. We report an extensive catalog of 1315 proteins identified in EVs isolated from two different CSF pools by ultracentrifugation, including 230 novel EV proteins. Out of 1315 proteins, 760 were identified in both CSF pools and about 30% of those were also quantitatively enriched in the EV fraction versus the soluble CSF fraction. The proteome of CSF EVs was enriched in exosomal markers such as alix and syntenin-1, heat shock proteins and tetraspanins and contained a high proportion of brain-derived proteins (n=373). Interestingly, several known biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases such as the amyloid precursor protein, the prion protein and DJ-1 were identified in the EV fractions. Our dataset represents the first comprehensive inventory of the EV proteome in CSF, underscoring the biomarker potential of this organelle. Further comparative studies on CSF EVs isolated from patients diagnosed with neurological disorders are warranted. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000608. Biological significance In this study we analyzed the protein composition of extracellular vesicles isolated from pooled samples of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a colorless fluid surrounding the brain and the spinal cord, important for the physiology of the central nervous system, ensuing mechanical protection, regulation of brain blood flow and elimination of byproducts of the brain. Since brain (patho)physiology is reflected in CSF, this biological fluid represents an ideal source of soluble and vesicle-based biomarkers for neurological diseases. Here we confirm the presence of exosome-like extracellular vesicles in CSF, underscoring a potential role in the physiology of the brain. These extracellular vesicles provide a rich source of candidate biomarkers, representing a brain "fluid biopsy". Most interestingly, the involvement of extracellular vesicles in transferring toxic proteins such as α-synuclein and β-amyloid has been postulated as one of the mechanisms involved in the spreading of neurodegeneration to different brain areas. In line with this, we show that human CSF extracellular vesicles contain prionogenic proteins such as the amyloid precursor protein and the prion protein. Delineating the protein composition of extracellular vesicles in CSF is a first and crucial step to comprehend their origin and their function in the central nervous system and to establish their biomarker potential.

Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of human plasma-derived microvesicles to find protein signatures of abdominal aortic aneurysms.	Proteomics Clin Appl	2014	PURPOSE: To find potential biomarkers of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), we performed a differential proteomic study based on human plasma-derived microvesicles. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Exosomes and microparticles isolated from plasma of AAA patients and control subjects (n = 10 each group) were analyzed by a label-free quantitative MS-based strategy. Homemade and publicly available software packages have been used for MS data analysis. RESULTS: The application of two kinds of bioinformatic tools allowed us to find differential protein profiles from AAA patients. Some of these proteins found by the two analysis methods belong to main pathological mechanisms of AAA such as oxidative stress, immune-inflammation, and thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Data analysis from label-free MS-based experiments requires the use of sophisticated bioinformatic approaches to perform quantitative studies from complex protein mixtures. The application of two of these bioinformatic tools provided us a preliminary list of differential proteins found in plasma-derived microvesicles not previously associated to AAA, which could help us to understand the pathological mechanisms related to this disease.

Tumor-derived exosomes promote tumor progression and T-cell dysfunction through the regulation of enriched exosomal microRNAs in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma.	Oncotarget	2014	Tumor-derived exosomes contain biologically active proteins and messenger and microRNAs (miRNAs). These particles serve as vehicles of intercellular communication and are emerging mediators of tumorigenesis and immune escape. Here, we isolated 30-100 nm exosomes from the serum of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) or the supernatant of TW03 cells. Increased circulating exosome concentrations were correlated with advanced lymphoid node stage and poor prognosis in NPC patients (P< 0.05). TW03-derived exosomes impaired T-cell function by inhibiting T-cell proliferation and Th1 and Th17 differentiation and promoting Treg induction by NPC cells in vitro. These results are associated with decreases in ERK, STAT1, and STAT3 phosphorylation and increases in STAT5 phosphorylation in exosome-stimulated T-cells. TW03-derived exosomes increased the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 but decreased IFNγ, IL-2, and IL-17 release from CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells. Furthermore, five commonly over-expressed miRNAs were identified in the exosomes from patient sera or NPC cells: hsa-miR-24-3p, hsa-miR-891a, hsa-miR-106a-5p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, and hsa-miR-1908. These over-expressed miRNA clusters down-regulated the MARK1 signaling pathway to alter cell proliferation and differentiation. Overall, these observations reveal the clinical relevance and prognostic value of tumor-derived exosomes and identify a unique intercellular mechanism mediated by tumor-derived exosomes to modulate T-cell function in NPC.

Electronic address: .	enadler@childrensnational.org		Adipocyte exosomes induce transforming growth factor beta pathway dysregulation in hepatocytes: a novel paradigm for obesity-related liver disease.	J Surg Res	2014	BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been attributed to increased systemic inflammation and insulin resistance mediated by visceral adipose tissue (VAT), although the exact mechanisms are undefined. Exosomes are membrane-derived vesicles containing messenger RNA, microRNA, and proteins, which have been implicated in cancer, neurodegenerative, and autoimmune diseases, which we postulated may be involved in obesity-related diseases. We isolated exosomes from VAT, characterized their content, and identified their potential targets. Targets included the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway, which has been linked to NAFLD. We hypothesized that adipocyte exosomes would integrate into HepG2 and hepatic stellate cell lines and cause dysregulation of the TGF-β pathway. METHODS: Exosomes from VAT from obese and lean patients were isolated and fluorescently labeled, then applied to cultured hepatic cell lines. After incubation, culture slides were imaged to detect exosome uptake. In separate experiments, exosomes were applied to cultured cells and incubated 48-h. Gene expression of TGF-β pathway mediators was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, and compared with cells, which were not exposed to exosomes. RESULTS: Fluorescent-labeled exosomes integrated into both cell types and deposited in a perinuclear distribution. Exosome exposure caused increased tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and integrin ανβ-5 expression and decreased matrix metalloproteinase-7 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression in to HepG2 cells and increased expression of TIMP-1, TIMP-4, Smad-3, integrins ανβ-5 and ανβ-8, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in hepatic stellate cells. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes from VAT integrate into liver cells and induce dysregulation of TGF-β pathway members in vitro and offers an intriguing possibility for the pathogenesis of NAFLD.

GDNF-transfected macrophages produce potent neuroprotective effects in Parkinson's disease mouse model.	PLoS One	2014	The pathobiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) projecting to the striatum. Currently, there are no treatments that can halt or reverse the course of PD; only palliative therapies, such as replacement strategies for missing neurotransmitters, exist. Thus, the successful brain delivery of neurotrophic factors that promote neuronal survival and reverse the disease progression is crucial. We demonstrated earlier systemically administered autologous macrophages can deliver nanoformulated antioxidant, catalase, to the SNpc providing potent anti-inflammatory effects in PD mouse models. Here we evaluated genetically-modified macrophages for active targeted brain delivery of glial cell-line derived neurotropic factor (GDNF). To capitalize on the beneficial properties afforded by alternatively activated macrophages, transfected with GDNF-encoded pDNA cells were further differentiated toward regenerative M2 phenotype. A systemic administration of GDNF-expressing macrophages significantly ameliorated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in PD mice. Behavioral studies confirmed neuroprotective effects of the macrophage-based drug delivery system. One of the suggested mechanisms of therapeutic effects is the release of exosomes containing the expressed neurotropic factor followed by the efficient GDNF transfer to target neurons. Such formulations can serve as a new technology based on cell-mediated active delivery of therapeutic proteins that attenuate and reverse progression of PD, and ultimately provide hope for those patients who are already significantly disabled by the disease.

Update on controls for isolation and quantification methodology of extracellular vesicles derived from adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cells.	Front Immunol	2014	The research field on extracellular vesicles (EV) has rapidly expanded in recent years due to the therapeutic potential of EV. Adipose tissue human mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) may be a suitable source for therapeutic EV. A major limitation in the field is the lack of standardization of the challenging techniques to isolate and characterize EV. The aim of our study was to incorporate new controls for the detection and quantification of EV derived from ASC and to analyze the applicability and limitations of the available techniques. ASC were cultured in medium supplemented with 5% of vesicles-free fetal bovine serum. The EV were isolated from conditioned medium by differential centrifugation with size filtration (0.2 μm). As a control, non-conditioned culture medium was used (control medium). To detect EV, electron microscopy, conventional flow cytometry, and western blot were used. The quantification of the EV was by total protein quantification, ExoELISA immunoassay, and Nanosight. Cytokines and growth factors in the EV samples were measured by multiplex bead array kit. The EV were detected by electron microscope. Total protein measurement was not useful to quantify EV as the control medium showed similar protein contents as the EV samples. The ExoELISA kits had technical troubles and it was not possible to quantify the concentration of exosomes in the samples. The use of Nanosight enabled quantification and size determination of the EV. It is, however, not possible to distinguish protein aggregates from EV with this method. The technologies for quantification and characterization of the EV need to be improved. In addition, we detected protein contaminants in the EV samples, which make it difficult to determine the real effect of EV in experimental models. It will be crucial in the future to optimize design novel methods for purification and characterization of EV.	PMC4204528

Human mesenchymal stroma/stem cells exchange membrane proteins and alter functionality during interaction with different tumor cell lines.	Stem Cells Dev	2015	To analyze effects of cellular interaction between human mesenchymal stroma/stem cells (MSC) and different cancer cells, direct co-cultures were performed and revealed significant growth stimulation of the tumor populations and a variety of protein exchanges. More than 90% of MCF-7 and primary human HBCEC699 breast cancer cells as well as NIH:OVCAR-3 ovarian adenocarcinoma cells acquired CD90 proteins during MSC co-culture, respectively. Furthermore, SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells progressively elevated CD105 and CD90 proteins in co-culture with MSC. Primary small cell hypercalcemic ovarian carcinoma cells (SCCOHT-1) demonstrated undetectable levels of CD73 and CD105; however, both proteins were significantly increased in the presence of MSC. This co-culture-mediated protein induction was also observed at transcriptional levels and changed functionality of SCCOHT-1 cells by an acquired capability to metabolize 5'cAMP. Moreover, exchange between tumor cells and MSC worked bidirectional, as undetectable expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in MSC significantly increased after co-culture with SK-OV-3 or NIH:OVCAR-3 cells. In addition, a small population of chimeric/hybrid cells appeared in each MSC/tumor cell co-culture by spontaneous cell fusion. Immune fluorescence demonstrated nanotube structures and exosomes between MSC and tumor cells, whereas cytochalasin-D partially abolished the intercellular protein transfer. More detailed functional analysis of FACS-separated MSC and NIH:OVCAR-3 cells after co-culture revealed the acquisition of epithelial cell-specific properties by MSC, including increased gene expression for cytokeratins and epithelial-like differentiation factors. Vice versa, a variety of transcriptional regulatory genes were down-modulated in NIH:OVCAR-3 cells after co-culture with MSC. Together, these mutual cellular interactions contributed to functional alterations in MSC and tumor cells.	PMC4425222

Physiol Rep	2015	Cellular delivery of small interfering RNAs to target cells of a tissue has the potential to travel by two intercellular pathways. For intimately apposed cells gap junctions allow transport exclusive of the extracellular space. For cells not in intimate contact, exocytotic release of vesicular contents and subsequent retrieval via endocytosis of exosomes and other vesicular contents represent an alternative intercellular delivery system that utilizes the extracellular space. Previous studies have shown siRNA/miRNA transfer from a delivery cell to a target cell via gap junction channels. We hypothesized that siRNA can be delivered via gap junctions and downregulate the expression of a reporter gene, the cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel gene (mHCN2), in the recipient cells of cell pairs. Whole-cell patch clamp was used to measure the mHCN2-induced current and junctional conductance. The target cells were HEK293 cells that endogenously express Cx43 or HeLaCx43 cells, both transfected with mHCN2. The source cells were HEK293 or HeLaCx43 cells transfected with fluorescent-labeled siRNA targeting mHCN2. We found that siRNA targeting mHCN2 resulted in significant downregulation of mHCN2 currents both in single cells and the recipient cell of a cell pair. In addition we also documented downregulation in target cells that were not in contact with source cells suggesting an extracellular-mediated delivery. To test further for extracellular delivery HEK293/HCN2 or HeLaCx43/HCN2 cells were cultured in medium collected from HEK293 or HeLaCx43 cells transfected with fluorescent-labeled siRNA or fluorescent-labeled morpholino designed to target HCN2. After 24 h single HEK293/HCN2 or HeLaCx43cells showed accumulation of siRNA. The mHCN2 currents were also down regulated in cells with siRNA uptake. Application of 200 nmol/L Bafilomycin A1, which has been shown to affect endosome acidification and endocytotic activity, resulted in a smaller accumulation of fluorescent-labeled siRNA in single target cells. In distinction to siRNA, morpholinos targeting HCN2 exhibited greatly reduced extracellularly mediated transfer while in cell pairs, target cells exhibited reduced HCN2 currents consistent with effective gap junction-mediated delivery.

Exosome-like vesicles derived by Schistosoma japonicum adult worms mediates M1 type immune- activity of macrophage.	Parasitol Res	2015	Exosomes are 30-100-nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin that are released into the extracellular space upon fusion of the multi-vesicular bodies (MVB) with the plasma membrane, while initial studies described that the role of exosomes was a reticulocyte cargo-disposal mechanism allowing remodeling of the plasma membrane during the maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes. Recent studies indicate that exosomes are secreted by most cells and pathogens and play an important role in intercellular signaling and exert regulatory function by carrying bioactive molecules. As numerous pathogens, adult worm of Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) reside in mesenteric veins of definitive host including man and mammal animals. It was reported that the worms or the eggs also have specialized secretion systems to export effector proteins or other molecules into host target cells. However, the mechanisms involved remained unclear. This study investigated the isolation of the exosome-like vesicles secreted by S. japonicum adult worms and its immune activity on microphage in vitro. In this report, we identified exosome-based secretion as a new mechanism for protein secretion by S. japonicum. Electron microscopy tomography revealed the previously unidentified ultrastructural detail of exosome-like vesicles with high resolution; they were found to be typical spherical shape and to have a diverse population that varies in size of 30-100 nm. Exosome-like vesicles isolated from S. japonicum contained a significantly different protein compared with debris pelleted and the apoptosis body. We also demonstrate that macrophages were preferentially differentiated into the M1 subtype while being treated with S. japonicum exosome-like vesicles. This study reveals there are exosome-like vesicles derived by S. japonicum adult worms, and the exosome-like vesicles can mediate M1-type immune- activity of macrophage.

Int J Parasitol	2015	The complex surface structure of adult Schistosoma mansoni, the tegument, is essential for survival of the parasite. This tegument is syncytial and is covered by two closely-apposed lipid bilayers that form the interactive surface with the host. In order to identify parasite-specific phospholipids present in the tegument, the species compositions of the major glycerophospholipid classes, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol, including lysophospholipid species, were analysed in adult S. mansoni worms, isolated tegumental membranes and hamster blood cells. It was shown that there are large differences in species composition in all four phospholipid classes between the membranes of S. mansoni and those of the host blood cells. The species compositions of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine were strikingly different in the tegument compared with the whole worm. The tegumental membranes are especially enriched in lysophospholipids, predominantly eicosenoic acid (20:1)-containing lyso-phosphatidylserine and lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine species. Furthermore, the tegument was strongly enriched in phosphatidylcholine that contained 5-octadecenoic acid, an unusual fatty acid that is not present in the host. As we have shown previously that lysophospholipids from schistosomes affect the parasite-host interaction, excretion of these tegument-specific phospholipid species was examined in vitro and in vivo. Our experiments demonstrated that these lysophospholipids are not significantly secreted during in vitro incubations and are not detectable in peripheral blood of infected hosts. However, these analyses demonstrated a substantial decrease in PI content of blood plasma from schistosome-infected hamsters, which might indicate that schistosomes influence exosome formation by the host.

Exosomes Secreted from CXCR4 Overexpressing Mesenchymal Stem Cells Promote Cardioprotection via Akt Signaling Pathway following Myocardial Infarction.	Stem Cells Int	2015	Background and Objective. Exosomes secreted from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have demonstrated cardioprotective effects. This study examined the role of exosomes derived from MSC overexpressing CXCR4 for recovery of cardiac functions after myocardial infarction (MI). Methods. In vitro, exosomes from MSC transduced with lentiviral CXCR4 (Exo(CR4)) encoding a silencing sequence or null vector were isolated and characterized by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Gene expression was then analyzed by qPCR and Western blotting. Cytoprotective effects on cardiomyocytes were evaluated and effects of exosomes on angiogenesis analyzed. In vivo, an exosome-pretreated MSC-sheet was implanted into a region of scarred myocardium in a rat MI model. Angiogenesis, infarct size, and cardiac functions were then analyzed. Results. In vitro, Exo(CR4) significantly upregulated IGF-1α and pAkt levels and downregulated active caspase 3 level in cardiomyocytes. Exo(CR4) also enhanced VEGF expression and vessel formation. However, effects of Exo(CR4) were abolished by an Akt inhibitor or CXCR4 knockdown. In vivo, Exo(CR4) treated MSC-sheet implantation promoted cardiac functional restoration by increasing angiogenesis, reducing infarct size, and improving cardiac remodeling. Conclusions. This study reveals a novel role of exosomes derived from MSC(CR4) and highlights a new mechanism of intercellular mediation of stem cells for MI treatment.	PMC4436515

PLoS One	2015	Tumor progression and the immune response are intricately linked. While it is known that cancers alter macrophage inflammatory responses to promote tumor progression, little is known regarding how cancers affect macrophage-dependent innate host defense. In this study, murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were exposed to murine carcinoma-conditioned media prior to assessment of the macrophage inflammatory response. BMDMs exposed to 4T1 mammary carcinoma-conditioned medium demonstrated enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-6, and CCL2 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) while production of interleukin-10 remained unchanged. The increased LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was transient and correlated with enhanced cytokine production in response to other Toll-like receptor agonists, including peptidoglycan and flagellin. In addition, 4T1-conditioned BMDMs exhibited strengthened LPS-induced nitric oxide production and enhanced phagocytosis of Escherichia coli. 4T1-mediated augmentation of macrophage responses to LPS was partially dependent on the NFκB pathway, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and actin polymerization, as well as the presence of 4T1-secreted extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, peritoneal macrophages obtained from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice displayed enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to LPS. These results suggest that uptake of 4T1-secreted factors and actin-mediated ingestion of 4T1-secreted exosomes by macrophages cause a transient enhancement of innate inflammatory responses. Mammary carcinoma-mediated regulation of innate immunity may have significant implications for our understanding of host defense and cancer progression.	PMC4503418

Biochim Biophys Acta	2015	Sepsis is an infection-induced severe inflammatory disorder that leads to multiple organ failure. Amongst organs affected, myocardial depression is believed to be a major contributor to septic death. While it has been identified that large amounts of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines are culprit for triggering cardiac dysfunction in sepsis, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Additionally, recent studies have shown that exosomes released from bacteria-infected macrophages are pro-inflammatory. Hence, we examined in this study whether blocking the generation of exosomes would be protective against sepsis-induced inflammatory response and cardiac dysfunction. To this end, we pre-treated RAW264.7 macrophages with GW4869, an inhibitor of exosome biogenesis/release, followed by endotoxin (LPS) challenge. In vivo, we injected wild-type (WT) mice with GW4869 for 1h prior to endotoxin treatment or cecal ligation/puncture (CLP) surgery. We observed that pre-treatment with GW4869 significantly impaired release of both exosomes and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) in RAW264.7 macrophages. At 12h after LPS treatment or CLP surgery, WT mice pre-treated with GW4869 displayed lower amounts of exosomes and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum than control PBS-injected mice. Accordingly, GW4869 treatment diminished the sepsis-induced cardiac inflammation, attenuated myocardial depression and prolonged survival. Together, our findings indicate that blockade of exosome generation in sepsis dampens the sepsis-triggered inflammatory response and thereby, improves cardiac function and survival.	PMC4581992

Directly visualized glioblastoma-derived extracellular vesicles transfer RNA to microglia/macrophages in the brain.	Neuro Oncol	2016	BACKGROUND: To understand the ability of gliomas to manipulate their microenvironment, we visualized the transfer of vesicles and the effects of tumor-released extracellular RNA on the phenotype of microglia in culture and in vivo. METHODS: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from primary human glioblastoma (GBM) cells were isolated and microRNAs (miRNAs) were analyzed. Primary mouse microglia were exposed to GBM-EVs, and their uptake and effect on proliferation and levels of specific miRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins were analyzed. For in vivo analysis, mouse glioma cells were implanted in the brains of mice, and EV release and uptake by microglia and monocytes/macrophages were monitored by intravital 2-photon microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis, as well as RNA and protein levels. RESULTS: Microglia avidly took up GBM-EVs, leading to increased proliferation and shifting of their cytokine profile toward immune suppression. High levels of miR-451/miR-21 in GBM-EVs were transferred to microglia with a decrease in the miR-451/miR-21 target c-Myc mRNA. In in vivo analysis, we directly visualized release of EVs from glioma cells and their uptake by microglia and monocytes/macrophages in brain. Dissociated microglia and monocytes/macrophages from tumor-bearing brains revealed increased levels of miR-21 and reduced levels of c-Myc mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Intravital microscopy confirms the release of EVs from gliomas and their uptake into microglia and monocytes/macrophages within the brain. Our studies also support functional effects of GBM-released EVs following uptake into microglia, associated in part with increased miRNA levels, decreased target mRNAs, and encoded proteins, presumably as a means for the tumor to manipulate its environs.

Tumour Biol	2016	Cancers constitutively produce and secrete into the blood and other biofluids 30-150 nm-sized endosomal vehicles called exosomes. Cancer-derived exosomes exhibit powerful influence on a variety of biological mechanisms to the benefit of the tumors that produce them. We studied the immunosuppressive ability of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) exosomes on two cytotoxic pathways of importance for anticancer immunity-the NKG2D receptor-ligand pathway and the DNAM-1-PVR/nectin-2 pathway. Using exosomes, isolated from EOC tumor explant and EOC cell-line culture supernatants, and ascitic fluid from EOC patients, we studied the expression of NKG2D and DNAM-1 ligands on EOC exosomes and their ability to downregulate the cognate receptors. Our results show that EOC exosomes differentially and constitutively express NKG2D ligands from both MICA/B and ULBP families on their surface, while DNAM-1 ligands are more seldom expressed and not associated with the exosomal membrane surface. Consequently, the NKG2D ligand-bearing EOC exosomes significantly downregulated the NKG2D receptor expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) while the DNAM-1 receptor was unaffected. The downregulation of NKG2D receptor expression was coupled to inhibition of NKG2D receptor-ligand-mediated degranulation and cytotoxicity measured in vitro with OVCAR-3 and K562 cells as targets. The EOC exosomes acted as a decoy impairing the NKG2D mediated cytotoxicity while the DNAM-1 receptor-ligand system remained unchanged. Taken together, our results support and explain the mechanism behind the recently reported finding that in EOC, NK-cell recognition and killing of tumor cells was mainly dependent on DNAM-1 signaling while the contribution of the NKG2D receptor-ligand pathway was complementary and uncertain.

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	Current analysis of exosomes focuses primarily on bulk analysis, where exosome-to-exosome variability cannot be assessed. In this study, we used Raman spectroscopy to study the chemical composition of single exosomes. We measured spectra of individual exosomes from 8 cell lines. Cell-line-averaged spectra varied considerably, reflecting the variation in total exosomal protein, lipid, genetic, and cytosolic content. Unexpectedly, single exosomes isolated from the same cell type also exhibited high spectral variability. Subsequent spectral analysis revealed clustering of single exosomes into 4 distinct groups that were not cell-line specific. Each group contained exosomes from multiple cell lines, and most cell lines had exosomes in multiple groups. The differences between these groups are related to chemical differences primarily due to differing membrane composition. Through a principal components analysis, we identified that the major sources of spectral variation among the exosomes were in cholesterol content, relative expression of phospholipids to cholesterol, and surface protein expression. For example, exosomes derived from cancerous versus non-cancerous cell lines can be largely separated based on their relative expression of cholesterol and phospholipids. We are the first to indicate that exosome subpopulations are shared among cell types, suggesting distributed exosome functionality. The origins of these differences are likely related to the specific role of extracellular vesicle subpopulations in both normal cell function and carcinogenesis, and they may provide diagnostic potential at the single exosome level.

Electronic address: .	gores.gregory@mayo.edu		Lipid-Induced Signaling Causes Release of Inflammatory Extracellular Vesicles From Hepatocytes.	Gastroenterology	2016	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocyte cellular dysfunction and death induced by lipids and macrophage-associated inflammation are characteristics of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The fatty acid palmitate can activate death receptor 5 (DR5) on hepatocytes, leading to their death, but little is known about how this process contributes to macrophage-associated inflammation. We investigated whether lipid-induced DR5 signaling results in the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from hepatocytes, and whether these can induce an inflammatory macrophage phenotype. METHODS: Primary mouse and human hepatocytes and Huh7 cells were incubated with palmitate, its metabolite lysophosphatidylcholine, or diluent (control). The released EV were isolated, characterized, quantified, and applied to macrophages. C57BL/6 mice were placed on chow or a diet high in fat, fructose, and cholesterol to induce NASH. Some mice also were given the ROCK1 inhibitor fasudil; 2 weeks later, serum EVs were isolated and characterized by immunoblot and nanoparticle-tracking analyses. Livers were collected and analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Incubation of primary hepatocytes and Huh7 cells with palmitate or lysophosphatidylcholine increased their release of EVs, compared with control cells. This release was reduced by inactivating mediators of the DR5 signaling pathway or rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) inhibition. Hepatocyte-derived EVs contained tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and induced expression of interleukin 1β and interleukin 6 messenger RNAs in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. Activation of macrophages required DR5 and receptor-interacting protein kinase 1. Administration of the ROCK1 inhibitor fasudil to mice with NASH reduced serum levels of EVs; this reduction was associated with decreased liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Lipids, which stimulate DR5, induce release of hepatocyte EVs, which activate an inflammatory phenotype in macrophages. Strategies to inhibit ROCK1-dependent release of EVs by hepatocytes might be developed for the treatment of patients with NASH.	PMC4808464

Electronic address: .	icls@ujs.edu.cn		Safety evaluation of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cell.	Cytotherapy	2016	BACKGROUND AIMS: Mounting evidence shows that non-cell-based transplantation of exosomes derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) has more potential protective and reparative effects than MSCs have. However, whether it is safe to transplant MSC exosomes into tissues is still not clear. In this study, we evaluated the safety of transplantation of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord MSCs (hucMSC exosomes). METHODS: hucMSC exosomes were incubated with the cardiac blood from a healthy rabbit, and hemolysis was observed. For analysis of vascular and muscle stimulation, pyrogen, systemic anaphylaxis and hematology indexes, hucMSC exosomes were given to rabbits, guinea pigs and rats. The histological changes in the vascular and muscle sites of injection in rabbits were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Allergy symptoms in guinea pigs and rectal temperature of rabbits were observed and recorded. To study safety in vivo, hucMSC exosomes were infused intravenously into rats with acute myocardial infarction. Rats' weight was measured and tail vein blood was collected to evaluate liver and renal function. RESULTS: hucMSC exosomes had a protective effect on weight loss and had no adverse effects on liver or renal function. Other detections, such as hemolysis, vascular and muscle stimulation, systemic anaphylaxis, pyrogen and hematology indexes, also showed that hucMSC exosomes were applicable. CONCLUSIONS: hucMSC exosomes are well tolerated in animal models. This study provides evidence for the safety of intravenous infusion in future clinical therapy.

Clin Cancer Res	2016	PURPOSE: Exosomes deliver signals to target cells and could thus be exploited as an innovative therapeutic tool. We investigated the ability of membrane TRAIL-armed exosomes to deliver proapoptotic signals to cancer cells and mediate growth inhibition in different tumor models. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND RESULTS: K562 cells, transduced with lentiviral human membrane TRAIL, were used for the production of TRAIL(+) exosomes, which were studied by nanoparticle tracking analysis, cytofluorimetry, immunoelectronmicroscopy, Western blot, and ELISA. In vitro, TRAIL(+) exosomes induced more pronounced apoptosis (detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide and activated caspase-3) in TRAIL-death receptor (DR)5(+) cells (SUDHL4 lymphoma and INT12 melanoma), with respect to the DR5(-)DR4(+)KMS11 multiple myeloma. Intratumor injection of TRAIL(+) exosomes, but not mock exosomes, induced growth inhibition of SUDHL4 (68%) and INT12 (51%), and necrosis in KMS11 tumors. After rapid blood clearance, systemically administered TRAIL(+) exosomes accumulated in the liver, lungs, and spleen and homed to the tumor site, leading to a significant reduction of tumor growth (58%) in SUDHL4-bearing mice. The treatment of INT12-bearing animals promoted tumor necrosis and a not statistically significant tumor volume reduction. In KMS11-bearing mice, despite massive perivascular necrosis, no significant tumor growth inhibition was detected. CONCLUSIONS: TRAIL-armed exosomes can induce apoptosis in cancer cells and control tumor progression in vivo Therapeutic efficacy was particularly evident in intratumor setting, while depended on tumor model upon systemic administration. Thanks to their ability to deliver multiple signals, exosomes thus represent a promising therapeutic tool in cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 22(14); 3499-512. ©2016 AACR.

Mol Hum Reprod	2016	STUDY QUESTION: What is the role of microRNAs (miRs) in antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-induced trophoblast inflammation? SUMMARY ANSWER: aPL-induced up-regulation of trophoblast miR-146a-3p is mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and miR-146a-3p in turn drives the cells to secrete interleukin (IL)-8 by activating the RNA sensor, TLR8. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by circulating aPL and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. We previously showed that aPL recognizing beta2 glycoprotein I (β2GPI) elicit human first trimester trophoblast secretion of IL-8 by activating TLR4. Since some miRs control TLR responses, their regulation in trophoblast cells by aPL and functional role in the aPL-mediated inflammatory response was investigated. miRs can be released from cells via exosomes, and therefore, miR exosome expression was also examined. A panel of miRs was selected based on their involvement with TLR signaling: miR-9; miR-146a-5p and its isomiR, miR-146a-3p; miR-155, miR-210; and Let-7c. Since certain miRs can activate the RNA sensor, TLR8, this was also investigated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: For in vitro studies, the human first trimester extravillous trophoblast cell line, HTR8 was studied. HTR8 cells transfected to express a TLR8 dominant negative (DN) were also used. Plasma was evaluated from pregnant women who have aPL, either with or without systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) (n = 39); SLE patients without aPL (n = 30); and healthy pregnant controls (n = 20). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Trophoblast HTR8 wildtype and TLR8-DN cells were incubated with or without aPL (mouse anti-human β2GPI mAb) for 48-72 h. HTR8 cells were also treated with or without aPL in the presence and the absence of a TLR4 antagonist (lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides; LPS-RS), specific miR inhibitors or specific miR mimics. miR expression levels in trophoblast cells, trophoblast-derived exosomes and exosomes isolated from patient plasma were measured by qPCR. Trophoblast IL-8 secretion was measured by ELISA. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: aPL significantly increased trophoblast cellular and exosome expression of miR-146a-5p, miR-146a-3p, miR-155 and miR-210. aPL-induced up-regulation of trophoblast miR-146a-5p, miR-146a-3p and miR-210, but not miR-155, was inhibited by the TLR4 antagonist, LPS-RS. While inhibition or overexpression of miR-146a-5p had no effect on aPL-induced trophoblast IL-8 secretion, miR-146a-3p inhibition significantly reduced this response. aPL-induced trophoblast IL-8 secretion was inhibited by the presence of the TLR8-DN. In the absence of aPL, transfection of trophoblast cells with a miR-146a-3p mimic significantly increased IL-8 secretion and this was inhibited by the presence of the TLR8-DN. Patients with aPL and adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) expressed significantly higher levels of circulating miR-146a-3p compared with healthy pregnant controls with no pregnancy complications (P < 0.05). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: While the enrichment of miR-146a-3p in trophoblast-derived exosomes support the role of this miR acting in a paracrine or endocrine manner through exosome delivery, this has not been demonstrated. However, miR-146a-3p may also exert its pro-inflammatory effect intracellularly within the same trophoblast cell targeted by aPL. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings provide a novel mechanism of trophoblast inflammation through miRs activating RNA-sensing receptors. Furthermore, circulating exosomal-associated miR-146a-3p in APS patients may serve clinically as a biomarker for related APOs.

Extracellular miR-1246 promotes lung cancer cell proliferation and enhances radioresistance by directly targeting DR5.	Oncotarget	2016	MiRNAs in the circulation have been demonstrated to be a type of signaling molecule involved in intercellular communication but little is known about their role in regulating radiosensitivity. This study aims to investigate the effects of extracellular miRNAs induced by ionizing radiation (IR) on cell proliferation and radiosensitivity. The miRNAs in the conditioned medium (CM) from irradiated and non-irradiated A549 lung cancer cells were compared using a microarray assay and the profiles of 21 miRNAs up and down-regulated by radiation were confirmed by qRT-PCR. One of these miRNAs, miR-1246, was especially abundant outside the cells and had a much higher level compared with that inside of cells. The expressions of miR-1246 in both A549 and H446 cells increased along with irradiation dose and the time post-irradiation. By labeling exosomes and miR-1246 with different fluorescence dyes, it was found that the extracellular miR-1246 could shuttle from its donor cells to other recipient cells by a non-exosome associated pathway. Moreover, the treatments of cells with miR-1246 mimic or its antisense inhibitor showed that the extracellular miR-1246 could enhance the proliferation and radioresistance of lung cancer cells. A luciferase reporter-gene transfer experiment demonstrated that the death receptor 5 (DR5) was the direct target of miR-1246, and the kinetics of DR5 expression was opposite to that of miR-1246 in the irradiated cells. Our results show that the oncogene-like extracellular miR-1246 could act as a signaling messenger between irradiated and non-irradiated cells, more importantly, it contributes to cell radioresistance by directly suppressing the DR5 gene.

Nephrol Dial Transplant	2016	BACKGROUND: Renal aquaporin-1 (AQP1), a water channel protein, is known to be secreted into urine, conveyed by nano-sized extracellular vesicles called exosomes. A previous study has demonstrated that acetazolamide (AZ), a diuretic that inhibits carbonic anhydrases, alters the expression level of AQP1 in cultured cells. Here we investigated whether AZ alters the release of urinary exosomal AQP1 in vivo. METHODS: The effect of AZ on urinary exosomal AQP1 secretion was examined in rats and compared with furosemide (another diuretic), NaHCO3 (an alkalizing agent) and NH4Cl (an acidifying agent). Urine, blood and kidney samples were obtained 2 h after each treatment. Urinary exosomes were isolated by a differential centrifugation technique and urinary exosomal proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. RESULTS: The release of exosomal AQP1 into urine was markedly increased after treatment with AZ, accompanied by alkaluria and metabolic acidosis. Immunohistochemistry clearly demonstrated that AZ increased the apical membrane expression of AQP1 in the proximal tubules. AZ did not affect the release of exosomal marker proteins (tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein and apoptosis-linked gene 2 interacting protein X). Treatment with furosemide did not change, whereas NaHCO3 and NH4Cl decreased the exosomal release of AQP1. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that AZ increases the release of exosomal AQP1 into urine in association with enhanced apical membrane expression of AQP1.

J Cancer Res Clin Oncol	2016	PURPOSE: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the causative agents of cervical cancer and are also associated with other types of cancers. HPVs can modulate microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed by infected cells. The production of extracellular vesicles is deregulated in cancer, and their cargo delivered to the microenvironment can promote tumorigenesis. The involvement of HPV oncoproteins on miRNA expression in cells and exosomes was analyzed in keratinocytes transduced with E6 and E7 from mucosal HPV-16 or cutaneous HPV-38 (K16 and K38). METHODS: MiRNAs were investigated through the TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA Cards, followed by real-time RT-PCR assay for specific miRNAs. Selected miRNA targets were analyzed by Western blot and correlated to the HPV oncoproteins by specifically silencing E6 and E7 expression. Exosomes, isolated from K16 and K38 supernatants by differential centrifugations, were quantified through the vesicle-associated acetylcholinesterase activity. RESULTS: MiRNAs deregulated in K16 and K38 cells were identified. HPV-16 and/or HPV-38 E6 and E7 single proteins can modify the expression of selected miRNAs involved in the tumorigenesis, in particular miR-18a, -19a, -34a and -590-5p. The analysis of the content of exosomes isolated from HPV-positive cells revealed the presence of E6 and E7 mRNAs and few miRNAs. MiR-222, a key miRNA deregulated in many cancers, was identified in exosomes from K16 cells. CONCLUSIONS: HPV E6 and/or E7 oncoprotein expression can induce the deregulation of some miRNAs. Through the production and function of exosomes, HPV oncogenes as well as HPV-deregulated miRNAs can potentiate the virus oncogenic effects in the tumor cell microenvironment.

TrkB-containing exosomes promote the transfer of glioblastoma aggressiveness to YKL-40-inactivated glioblastoma cells.	Oncotarget	2016	The neurotrophin receptors are known to promote growth and proliferation of glioblastoma cells. Their functions in spreading glioblastoma cell aggressiveness to the microenvironment through exosome release from glioblastoma cells are unknown. Considering previous reports demonstrating that YKL-40 expression is associated with undifferentiated glioblastoma cancer stem cells, we used YKL-40-silenced cells to modulate the U87-MG differentiated state and their biological aggressiveness. Herein, we demonstrated a relationship between neurotrophin-receptors and YKL-40 expression in undifferentiated cells. Differential functions of cells and derived-exosomes were evidenced according to neurotrophin receptor content and differentiated cell state by comparison with control pLKO cells. YKL-40 silencing of glioblastoma cells impairs proliferation, neurosphere formation, and their ability to induce endothelial cell (HBMEC) migration. The modulation of differentiated cell state in YKL-40-silenced cells induces a decrease of TrkB, sortilin and p75NTR cellular expressions, associated with a low-aggressiveness phenotype. Interestingly, TrkB expressed in exosomes derived from control cells was undetectable in exosomes from YKL-40 -silenced cells. The transfer of TrkB-containing exosomes in YKL-40-silenced cells contributed to restore cell proliferation and promote endothelial cell activation. Interestingly, in U87 MG xenografted mice, TrkB-depleted exosomes from YKL-40-silenced cells inhibited tumor growth in vivo. These data highlight that TrkB-containing exosomes play a key role in the control of glioblastoma progression and aggressiveness. Furthermore, TrkB expression was detected in exosomes isolated from plasma of glioblastoma patients, suggesting that this receptor may be considered as a new biomarker for glioblastoma diagnosis.

J Control Release	2016	Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and their exosomes can suppress immune reaction and deliver small RNAs. Thus, they may improve islet transplantation by delivering small RNAs for promoting islet function and inhibiting immune rejection. Here, we proposed an hBMSC and its exosome-based therapy to overcome immune rejection and poor islet function, both of which hinder the success of islet transplantation. We found overexpressed siFas and anti-miR-375 in plasmid encoding shFas and anti-miR-375 transfected hBMSC-derived exosomes, which silenced Fas and miR-375 of human islets and improved their viability and function against inflammatory cytokines. This plasmid transfected hBMSCs downregulated Fas and miR-375 of human islets in a humanized NOD scid gamma (NSG) mouse model, whose immune reaction was inhibited by injecting hBMSC and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) co-cultured exosomes. These exosomes suppressed immune reaction by inhibiting PBMC proliferation and enhancing regulatory T cell (Treg) function. Collectively, our studies elucidated the mechanisms of RNA delivery from hBMSCs to human islets and the immunosuppressive effect of hBMSC and peripheral blood mononuclear cell co-cultured exosomes for improving islet transplantation.

J Neurosci Res	2016	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane nanovesicles of diverse sizes secreted by different cell types and are involved in intercellular communication. EVs shuttle proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids that reflect their cellular origin and could mediate their biological function in recipient cells. EVs circulate in biological fluids and are considered as potential biomarkers that could be used to analyze and characterize disease development, course and response to treatment. EVs exhibit specific distribution of glycolipids and membrane organization, but little is known about the biological significance of this distribution or how it could contribute to pathological conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS). We provide the first description of sulfatide composition in plasma-derived EVs by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We found that EVs of different sizes showed C16:0 sulfatide but no detectable levels of C18:0, C24:0, or C24:1 sulfatide species. Small EVs isolated at 100,000 × g-enriched in exosomes-from plasma of patients with MS showed a significant increase of C16:0 sulfatide compared with healthy controls. Nanoparticle tracking analysis showed that the particle size distribution in MS plasma was significantly different compared with healthy controls. Characterization of small EVs isolated from MS plasma showed similar protein content and similar levels of exosomal markers (Alix, Rab-5B) and vesicular marker MHC class I (major histocompatibility complex class I) compared with healthy controls. Our findings indicate that C16:0 sulfatide associated with small EVs is a candidate biomarker for MS that could potentially reflect pathological changes associated with this disease and/or the effects of its treatment. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Kidney Int	2016	Administration of human cord blood endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) or their exosomes protects mice against kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury. Here we studied the microRNA (miRNA) content of ECFC exosomes and the role of miRNA transfer in kidney and endothelial cell protection. ECFC exosomes were enriched in miR-486-5p, which targets the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and the Akt pathway. In cultured endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia, incubation with ECFC exosomes increased miR-486-5p, decreased PTEN, and stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Exposure of hypoxic endothelial cells to conditioned medium from ECFCs pretreated with anti-miR-486-5p blocked increases in miR-486-5p and phosphorylated Akt, restored expression of PTEN, and enhanced apoptosis. Coculture of endothelial cells with ECFCs enhanced endothelial miR-486-5p levels. Targeting of PTEN by miR-486-5p was observed in endothelial cells, and PTEN knockdown blocked apoptosis. In mice with ischemic kidney injury, infusion of ECFC exosomes induced potent functional and histologic protection, associated with increased kidney miR-486-5p levels, decreased PTEN, and activation of Akt. Infusion of exosomes from ECFCs transfected with anti-miR-486-5p had no protective effect. Thus, delivery of ECFC exosomes reduces ischemic kidney injury via transfer of miR-486-5p targeting PTEN. Exosomes enriched in miR-486-5p could represent a therapeutic tool in acute kidney injury.

Let-7a inhibits migration of melanoma cells via down-regulation of HMGA2 expression.	Am J Transl Res	2016	This study aimed to investigate the effects of exosomes derived from BM-MSCs transduced with let-7a on B16f10 cells and BM-MSCs. BM-MSCs were transduced with let-7a and the exosomes of them were isolated for further culture of B16f10 cells and BM-MSCs. The migration of B16f10 cells were detected by transwell, proliferation of B16f10 cells and BM-MSCs was examined by MTT method, HMGA2 expression was measured by western blot. In addition, the let-7a secreted level in exosomes and IGF level were measured by RT-PCR and ELISA respectively. Our results showed that the level of let-7a in exosomes derived from Let-7a-transducted BM-MSCs was increased after treated by exosomes. HMGA2 in B16f10 cells was down-regulated and cell survival rate of BM-MSCs was decreased. However, neither cell survival rate of B16f10 cells nor IGF-1 secreted by B16f10 cells in different groups had significant differences. In conclusion, Let-7a contained in exosomes can inhibit the migration of Melanoma cells and inhibit the proliferation of BM-MSCs.	PMC5040666

Plant Physiol	2017	Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) that play a central role in intercellular signaling in mammals by transporting proteins and small RNAs. Plants are also known to produce EVs, particularly in response to pathogen infection. The contents of plant EVs have not been analyzed, however, and their function is unknown. Here, we describe a method for purifying EVs from the apoplastic fluids of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves. Proteomic analyses of these EVs revealed that they are highly enriched in proteins involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses. Consistent with this finding, EV secretion was enhanced in plants infected with Pseudomonas syringae and in response to treatment with salicylic acid. These findings suggest that EVs may represent an important component of plant immune responses.	PMC5210723

Cancer Lett	2017	In the cancer microenvironment, extracellular communication allows various types of cells to coordinate and execute biological functions. Emerging evidence indicates that exosomes, as mediators of cell communication, are involved in tumor progression. Little is known, however, about the mechanism by which exosomal miRNAs regulate inflammatory infiltration in arsenite-induced liver cancer. The present research aimed to determine if miRNAs secreted from arsenite-transformed human hepatic epithelial (L-02) cells are transferred into normal L-02 and THLE-3 cells, which are functionally active in the recipient cells. The results show that the exosomes from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells enhance miR-155 expression and the pro-inflammatory properties of normal L-02 and THLE-3 cells. Transformed cells transfer miR-155 into normal L-02 cells via exosomes. The inhibition of NF-κB by siRNA and inhibitor, which reduces miR-155 levels in exosomes derived from transformed L-02 cells, blocks inflammation. Arsenite-transformed cells secrete exosomes to enhance inflammation, but the inhibition of the synthesis of exosomes fails to stimulate inflammation. miR-155 is involved in exosome-mediated intercellular communication between neoplastic and normal liver cells. In addition, miR-155, IL-6, and IL-8 were over-expressed in the serum of arsenite exposure group. And there was a positive correlation between miR-155 and IL-6 or IL-8 levels. Further, exosomal miR-155 was up-regulated in the serum of arsenite exposure group. Thus, these results show that exosomes derived from transformed L-02 cells transfer miR-155 to surrounding cells, which induces pro-inflammatory activity of normal liver cells. The findings support the concept that exosomal miRNAs are involved in cell-cell communication during carcinogenesis induced by environmental chemicals.

Circulating exosomal microRNA-96 promotes cell proliferation, migration and drug resistance by targeting LMO7.	J Cell Mol Med	2017	Detection and treatment of lung cancer still remain a clinical challenge. This study aims to validate exosomal microRNA-96 (miR-96) as a serum biomarker for lung cancer and understand the underlying mechanism in lung cancer progression. MiR-96 expressions in normal and lung cancer patients were characterized by qPCR analysis. Changes in cell viability, migration and cisplatin resistance were monitored after incubation with isolated miR-96-containing exosomes, anti-miR-96 and anti-miR negative control (anti-miR-NC) transfections. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to study interaction between miR-96 and LIM-domain only protein 7 (LMO7). Changes induced by miR-96 transfection and LMO7 overexpression were also evaluated. MiR-96 expression was positively correlated with high-grade and metastatic lung cancers. While anti-miR-96 transfection exhibited a tumour-suppressing function, exosomes isolated from H1299 enhanced cell viability, migration and cisplatin resistance. Potential miR-96 binding sites were found within the 3'-UTR of wild-type LMO7 gene, but not of mutant LMO7 gene. LMO7 expression was inversely correlated with lung cancer grades, and LMO7 overexpression reversed promoting effect of miR-96. We have identified exosomal miR-96 as a serum biomarker of malignant lung cancer. MiR-96 promotes lung cancer progression by targeting LMO7. The miR-96-LMO7 axis may be a therapeutic target for lung cancer patients, and new diagnostic or therapeutic strategies could be developed by targeting the miR-96-LMO7 axis.	PMC5431139

Clin Exp Rheumatol	2017 Sep-Oct	OBJECTIVES: Exosomes are lipid bilayer-bound microvesicles containing various macromolecules including numerous microRNA (miRNA). Exosomes mediate intercellular communication by fusing and releasing their macromolecular content into target cells. Here, we analysed the content of profibrotic and antifibrotic miRNAs in exosomes isolated from the serum of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients and tested their ability to induce a profibrotic phenotype in normal human dermal fibroblasts in vitro. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from serum from patients with limited cutaneous or diffuse cutaneous SSc and were characterised by Nanosight Particle Tracking Analysis, exosome antibody arrays, and transmission electron microscopy. The content of nine profibrotic and eighteen antifibrotic miRNA was assessed in the isolated exosomes by semiquantitative real time PCR. The effects of the isolated exosomes on cultured normal human dermal fibroblasts were assessed by real time PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: The isolated serum exosomes displayed the expected exosome size and morphology and contained characteristic exosome proteins. Six profibrotic miRNAs were increased and ten antifibrotic miRNAs were decreased in SSc serum exosomes compared to normal serum exosomes. The levels of eight miRNA were significantly different between exosomes from limited and diffuse SSc. Exosomes isolated from both limited or diffuse SSc patients caused dose-dependent stimulation of profibrotic gene expression and type I collagen and fibronectin production and secretion in normal human dermal fibroblasts in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Serum exosomes from SSc patients contain miRNA displaying a markedly profibrotic profile and induce a profibrotic phenotype in target normal fibroblasts in vitro suggesting a plausible mechanism for the extension of the fibrotic SSc process to non-affected tissues.

J Invest Dermatol	2017	Flap necrosis is the most frequent postoperative complication encountered in reconstructive surgery. We elucidated whether adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and their derivatives might induce neovascularization and protect skin flaps during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Flaps were subjected to 3 hours of ischemia by ligating long thoracic vessels and then to blood reperfusion. Qtracker-labeled ADSCs, ADSCs in conditioned medium (ADSC-CM), or ADSC exosomes (ADSC-Exo) were injected into the flaps. These treatments led to significantly increased flap survival and capillary density compared with I/R on postoperative day 5. IL-6 levels in the cell lysates or in conditioned medium were significantly higher in ADSCs than in Hs68 fibroblasts. ADSC-CM and ADSC-Exo increased tube formation. This result was corroborated by a strong decrease in skin repair after adding IL-6-neutralizing antibodies or small interfering RNA for IL-6 ADSCs. ADSC transplantation also increased flap recovery in I/R injury of IL-6-knockout mice. IL-6 was secreted from ADSCs through signal transducer and activator of transcription phosphorylation, and then IL-6 stimulated angiogenesis and enhanced recovery after I/R injury by the classic signaling pathway. The mechanism of skin recovery includes the direct differentiation of ADSCs into endothelial cells and the indirect effect of IL-6 released from ADSCs. ADSC-CM and ADSC-Exo could be used as off-the-shelf products for this therapy.

Toxicol In Vitro	2017	Recent studies have illustrated the growing importance of exosomes (small extracellular vesicles) and their constituent microRNAs (miRNAs) in the fields of toxicology and pathology. The mechanism of toxicity of toluene, a highly-prevalent and volatile organic compound, is largely unknown. To examine the role of miRNAs in toluene-induced toxicity, we investigated miRNAs and toluene-induced gene expression in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and exosomes using microarrays. A total of 54 miRNAs were differentially expressed in HL-60 cell lines exposed to toluene and exosomes from the cells. Four out of the 54 miRNAs (hsa-miR-1290, hsa-miR-718, hsa-miR-3663-3p, and hsa-miR-320c) were subsequently validated by qRT-PCR. Integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles identified 8 miRNA-mRNA correlations. By performing Comparative Toxicogenomics Database analysis, we found that the eight putative target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs under toluene exposure (EXOSC6, RHOH, GFER, HERC2, GOLGA4, SLC7A11, GCLM, and BACH1) are related to diverse disease categories such as nervous system disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory tract disease. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that miRNA-mRNA networks provide a better understanding of toxicological mechanism caused by environmental pollutants in vitro using HL-60 cells and exosomes.

Large-scale isolation and cytotoxicity of extracellular vesicles derived from activated human natural killer cells.	J Extracell Vesicles	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been the focus of great interest, as they appear to be involved in numerous important cellular processes. They deliver bioactive macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, allowing intercellular communication in multicellular organisms. EVs are secreted by all cell types, including immune cells such as natural killer cells (NK), and they may play important roles in the immune system. Currently, a large-scale procedure to obtain functional NK EVs is lacking, limiting their use clinically. In this report, we present a simple, robust, and cost-effective method to isolate a large quantity of NK EVs. After propagating and activating NK cells ex vivo and then incubating them in exosome-free medium for 48 h, EVs were isolated using a polymer precipitation method. The isolated vesicles contain the tetraspanin CD63, an EV marker, and associated proteins (fibronectin), but are devoid of cytochrome C, a cytoplasmic marker. Nanoparticle tracking analysis showed a size distribution between 100 and 200 nm while transmission electron microscopy imaging displayed vesicles with an oval shape and comparable sizes, fulfilling the definition of EV. Importantly, isolated EV fractions were cytotoxic against cancer cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrate for the first time that isolated activated NK (aNK) cell EVs contain the cytotoxic proteins perforin, granulysin, and granzymes A and B, incorporated from the aNK cells. Activation of caspase -3, -7 and -9 was detected in cancer cells incubated with aNK EVs, and caspase inhibitors blocked aNK EV-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting that aNK EVs activate caspase pathways in target cells. The ability to isolate functional aNK EVs on a large scale may lead to new clinical applications.

Differential expression of urinary exosomal microRNAs in IgA nephropathy.	J Clin Lab Anal	2018	BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common type of primary glomerulonephritis in the world. Reliable biomarkers are required for the non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of IgAN. This study aims to investigate the difference in urinary exosomal microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles between patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and healthy controls, which may provide clues to identify novel potential non-invasive miRNA biomarkers for renal diseases. METHODS: Urine samples were collected from eighteen healthy controls and eighteen patients with IgAN. Differential centrifugation was performed to isolate exosomes from urine samples. High-throughput sequencing and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were sequentially used to screen and further validate miRNA expression profiles in urinary exosomes of patients with IgAN in two independent cohorts. RESULTS: Urinary exosomes were successfully isolated to obtain exosomal miRNAs. MiR-215-5p and miR-378i were significantly upregulated in urinary exosomes of patients with IgAN compared with healthy controls (P<.01), while miR-29c and miR-205-5p were significantly downregulated (P<.05). MiR-215-5p, miR-378i, miR-365b-3p and miR-135b-5p were found to have altered expression in patients with IgAN from validation cohorts, which was consistent with the high-throughput sequencing analysis. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that there is a significant difference in urinary exosomal miRNA profiles between patients with IgAN and healthy controls. These exosomal miRNAs, such as miR-29c, miR-146a and miR-205 may potentially serve as novel non-invasive biomarkers for IgAN.

Modulation of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1 by the pro-invasive miR-5096 in glioblastoma cells.	Oncotarget	2017	Inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir), and especially the barium-sensitive Kir4.1 encoded by KCNJ10, are key regulators of glial functions. A lower expression or mislocation of Kir4.1 is detected in human brain tumors. MicroRNAs participate in the regulation of ionic channels and associated neurologic disorders. Here, we analyze effects of miR-5096 on the Kir4.1 expression and function in two glioblastoma cell lines, U87 and U251. Using whole-cell patch-clamp and western-blot analysis, we show that cell loading with miR-5096 decreases the Kir4.1 protein level and associated K+ current. Cell treatment with barium, a Kir4.1 blocker, or cell loading of miR-5096 both increase the outgrowth of filopodia in glioma cells, as observed by time-lapse microscopy. Knocking-down Kir4.1 expression by siRNA transfection similarly increased both filopodia formation and invasiveness of glioma cells as observed in Boyden chamber assay. MiR-5096 also promotes the release of extracellular vesicles by which it increases its own transfer to surrounding cells, in a Kir4.1-dependent manner in U251 but not in U87. Altogether, our results validate Kir4.1 as a miR-5096 target to promote invasion of glioblastoma cells. Our data highlight the complexity of microRNA effects and the role of K+ channels in cancer.

Protein Cell	2017	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an intestinal immune-dysfunctional disease worldwide whose prevalence increasing in Asia including China. It is a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract with unknown cause. Exosomes are small vesicles in various body fluids. They have diameters of 40-120 nm, and one of their functions is long-distance transfer of various substances. In this study, we investigated the contents of salivary exosomes in patients with IBD and in healthy controls to explore a new biomarker in patients with IBD. In this study, whole saliva was obtained from patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC), n = 37; Crohn's disease (CD), n = 11) and apparently healthy individuals (HC, n = 10). Salivary exosomes were extracted from samples, and the proteins within the exosomes were identified by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). The results showed that more than 2000 proteins were detected in salivary exosomes from patients with IBD. Through gene ontology analysis, we found that proteasome subunit alpha type 7 (PSMA7) showed especially marked differences between patients with IBD and the healthy controls, in that its expression level was much higher in the CD and UC groups. This exosomal protein is related to proteasome activity and inflammatory responses. So we conclude that in this research, salivary exosomal PSMA7 was present at high levels in salivary exosomes from subjects with IBD. It can be a very promising biomarker to release the patients from the pain of colonoscopy.	PMC5563283

Acta Neuropathol Commun	2017	Proteins implicated in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) have been identified in bodily fluids encased in extracellular vesicles called exosomes. Whether exosomes found in DLB patients can transmit pathology is not clear. In this study, exosomes were successfully harvested through ultracentrifugation from brain tissue from DLB and AD patients as well as non-diseased brain tissue. Exosomes extracted from brains diagnosed with either AD or DLB contained aggregate-prone proteins. Furthermore, injection of brain-derived exosomes from DLB patients into the brains of wild type mice induced α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation. As assessed through immunofluorescent double labeling, α-syn aggregation was observed in MAP2+, Rab5+ neurons. Using a neuronal cell line, we also identified intracellular α-syn aggregation mediated by exosomes is dependent on recipient cell endocytosis. Together, these data suggest that exosomes from DLB patients are sufficient for seeding and propagating α-syn aggregation in vivo.	PMC5466770

Diabetes Res Clin Pract	2017	AIMS: To investigate the alteration pattern and physiologic state of islet-specific miR-7 in the serum of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and T2DM-associated microvascular complications (T2DMC) and to evaluate its clinical significance. METHODS: The levels of serum miR-7 were firstly examined and compared in 76 T2DM patients, 76 T2DMC patients and 74 age-gender matched controls using RT-qPCR. Subsequently, the physiologic state of serum miR-7 was characterized by determining its concentrations in isolated exosomes and corresponding exosome-free samples from the same three cohorts' samples. Moreover, statistical analyzes were performed to evaluate the associations of serum miR-7 with T2DM and T2DMC. RESULTS: Serum miR-7 was significantly elevated in the T2DM patients [(401.0±34.37) fmol/L, P<0.001] and in the T2DMC patients [(501.4±81.69) fmol/L, P<0.001] when compared with the controls [(175.7±16.59) fmol/L]. Circulating miR-7 was mainly existed as exosome-free form rather than in membrane-bound exosomes. The concentrations of exosome-free miR-7 were markedly higher in the T2DM group [(107.2±9.63) fmol/L, P<0.001] and in the T2DMC group [(122.1±10.80) fmol/L, P<0.001] compared to the control group [(54.18±2.37) fmol/L]. Logistic regression and ROC curve analyses revealed the serum miR-7 was significantly associated with T2DM and microvascular complications (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Increased serum miR-7 might have the potential as a promising marker for T2DM and its microvascular complications.

Theriogenology	2017	Avian sperm are stored in the sperm storage tubules (SSTs) of the hen oviduct for a prolonged period. However, the precise mechanisms by which sperm are kept alive in the SSTs are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether exosomes are secreted by SST cells and play a role in the survival of sperm. Utero-vaginal junction (UVJ) tissue from approximately 50 wk old White Leghorn hens was collected before (control group) and after intravaginal insemination with seminal plasma (SP group) or semen (AI group). The samples were used to prepare frozen sections and total protein extraction. The localization of the CD63, an exosome marker, was determined by immunohistochemistry and its protein level in the UVJ mucosal tissues was examined by Western blot. Exosomes were isolated from the culture media of UVJ and vaginal mucosa cells by ultracentrifugation and characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The viability and motility of sperm incubated with exosomes were also examined. CD63 was localized in the apical region of UVJ mucosal epithelium cells and SST cells of control, SP, and AI groups. The CD63 protein decreased in SST cells surrounding resident sperm and tended to appear in the SST lumen in the AI group. The protein level of CD63 in UVJ mucosal tissues was significantly higher in the AI group than control. The CD63 protein (approximately 75 kDa) was detected in ultracentrifugation pellets from the culture medium of UVJ and vagina cells. The viability of sperm incubated with 1 μg/μl vaginal exosomes was significantly decreased but was not affected by UVJ exosomes. These results suggest that exosomes were synthesized by SST cells and may be secreted into SST lumen when sperm were stored in SSTs. The role of SST exosomes in sperm storage needs to be examined further.

J Sex Med	2017	BACKGROUND: The efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in alleviating erectile dysfunction (ED) of diabetic rats has been demonstrated mainly through a paracrine effect. However, exosomes (EXOs), which are important bioactive substance vectors secreted by ADSCs, have never been associated with ED. AIM: To investigate the effect of ADSC-derived EXOs on erectile function in a type 2 diabetic ED rat model. METHODS: EXOs were isolated from the supernatants of cultured ADSCs by ultracentrifugation. We constructed a type 2 diabetic rat model using a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin administered by intraperitoneal injection. In total, 24 diabetic rats were randomly assigned to three groups and were treated with an intracavernous injection of ADSC-derived EXOs, ADSCs, or phosphate buffered saline. Another eight age-matched rats underwent sham operation and composed the normal control group. OUTCOMES: Intracavernous pressure and mean arterial pressure testing and histologic and western blot analyses were performed 4 weeks after the intracavernous injection. RESULTS: ADSC-derived EXOs and ADSCs administered by intracavernous injection led to an increase in the ratio of intracavernous pressure to mean arterial pressure compared with that for phosphate buffered saline treatment. Histologic and western blot analyses demonstrated an increased ratio of smooth muscle to collagen, increased expression of an endothelial marker (CD31), a smooth muscle marker (α-smooth muscle actin), and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and decreased the expression of the apoptotic protein cleaved caspase-3 and apoptosis of endothelial and smooth muscle cells in the corpus cavernosum tissue after EXO or ADSC injection compared with values for the phosphate buffered saline treatment. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: The present results are expected to provide a scientific foundation for clinical application in the near future. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Although the results demonstrated that intracavernous injection of ADSC-derived EXOs could ameliorate ED of diabetic rats, the optimum dose and times of injection remain for further study. CONCLUSIONS: ADSC-derived EXOs, similarly to ADSCs, were capable of rescuing corpus cavernosum endothelial and smooth muscle cells by inhibiting apoptosis and thus promoting the recovery of erectile function in type 2 diabetic rats.

Methods Mol Biol	2017	In order to more fully elucidate the biogenesis of exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and understand the role of EVs in disease processes, it is necessary to develop methods to capture EVs and induce the unloading of viable cargo. Traditionally, ultracentrifugation followed by chemical based EV lysis techniques is used to isolate these extracellular vesicles and release their internal content. Here, we describe a novel technique for capturing and releasing exosomal content through magnetic bead-based EV extraction coupled with electric field induced release and measurement (EFIRM). The usage of low-voltage electric fields allows the EV to be lysed without chemical treatment, and surface immobilized probes can allow for the rapid capture of the content of lysed EVs. EFIRM as an integrated EV lysing and analysis system offers great potential for the investigation of EVs in clinical and basic science contexts.

J Dairy Sci	2017	A contributing factor to declining fertility in dairy cows is an activated inflammatory system associated with uterine infection. Detecting uterine disease using biomarkers may allow earlier diagnosis and intervention with resultant improvements in fertility. Exosomes are known to participate in intercellular communication, paracrine, and endocrine signaling. Exosomes carry a cargo of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that represent specific cellular sources. Prostaglandins are lipids that are critical determinants of bovine fertility. In this study exosomes were isolated from the plasma of cows before (d 0) and during (d 10) the study in healthy animals or those with an induced uterine infection in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Exosomes were characterized for size and number (nanoparticle tracking analysis), exosomal marker expression (Western blot), and morphology (transmission electron microscopy). No significant differences were observed in exosome size or number. The abundance of exosome-enriched markers was confirmed in noninfected and infected animals. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the morphology of the exosomes. These exosomes were co-incubated with bovine endometrial epithelial and stromal cells. Exosomes from d-10-infected animal plasma decreased PGF2α production in endometrial epithelial but not stromal cells. For future research, the identification of effectors in the cargo may provide a useful basis for early diagnosis of uterine infection using an exosomal characterization approach.

Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)	2018	Exosomes are a subset of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that have important roles in intercellular communication. They contain and carry bioactive molecules within their membranes which are delivered to target cells. Reproducible isolation and enrichment of these exosomes will aid in evaluation of cellular communication. We present an approach that involved the pre-processing of plasma, combined with ultracentrifugation (UC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to isolate EVs and subsequently enrich exosomes. Four variations of this approach (denoted methods I to IV) were compared. Coupling an ultracentrifugation method with size exclusion chromatography (Method II) provided the best yield by nanoparticle tracking analyses (NTA), the presence of the exosomal markers CD63, Flotillin-1 and TSG-101 (immunoblotting) and showed exosome morphology using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This method provides an efficient way to enrich the exosomes from blood (plasma), which could be potentially employed for clinical diagnostic assessment and therapeutic intervention.	
28992005	M D Mitchell				Characterization of exosomes from body fluids of dairy cows.	J Anim Sci	2017	Exosomes are a specific subpopulation of extracellular vesicles that are widely released by cells of different origins with divergent functions that make their way into body fluids that can be conveniently sampled. In the current study, we isolated and evaluated exosomes from concurrently collected samples of milk, plasma, saliva, and urine from a group of 6 pregnant Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (aged 7 mo, 174 to 203 d of gestation). The cows had BCS of 3.5 to 5.25 (on a scale of 1 to 10), and the milk production for the season to the time of sampling ranged between 5,118 and 6,959 kg. The low levels of extracellular vesicles in saliva and urine (more than 86% fewer compared to the extracellular vesicles in milk and plasma) precluded further detailed evaluation since utility for diagnostics was deemed unlikely. In exosomes isolated from milk and plasma, size distribution, morphology, and the presence of exosome markers was confirmed by nanoparticle tracking analysis, electron microscopy, and Western blot. In addition, a targeted proteomic approach using the quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer was also used in the study to screen for the exosome marker (e.g., Tumor susceptibility gene 101). Following confirmation of the presence of exosomes, the proteomic profiles of milk and plasma exosomes were evaluated using information-dependent acquisition-mediated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The milk exosomes contain proteins that differed greatly from the plasma exosomes, with only 8 similar proteins harbored in both the milk and plasma exosomes. The milk and plasma exosomes were found to contain proteins (e.g., immunoglobulin J chain and α2 macroglobulin) associated with specific biological processes and molecular functions. Hence, the fluid of origin required for exosome analysis will be dependent on the specific information needed. In conclusion, isolated exosomes from milk and plasma samples collected at the same time point from the same dairy cows encapsulated different profiles of proteins associated with different biological processes and molecular functions.

Sci Rep	2017	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Disease severity inversely correlates to the amount of SMN protein produced from the homologous SMN2 gene. We show that SMN protein is naturally released in exosomes from all cell types examined. Fibroblasts from patients or a mouse model of SMA released exosomes containing reduced levels of SMN protein relative to normal controls. Cells overexpressing SMN protein released exosomes with dramatically elevated levels of SMN protein. We observed enhanced quantities of exosomes in the medium from SMN-depleted cells, and in serum from a mouse model of SMA and a patient with Type 3 SMA, suggesting that SMN-depletion causes a deregulation of exosome release or uptake. The quantity of SMN protein contained in the serum-derived exosomes correlated with the genotype of the animal, with progressively less protein in carrier and affected animals compared to wildtype mice. SMN protein was easily detectable in exosomes isolated from human serum, with a reduction in the amount of SMN protein in exosomes from a patient with Type 3 SMA compared to a normal control. Our results suggest that exosome-derived SMN protein may serve as an effective biomarker for SMA.	PMC5655039

Cell Commun Signal	2017	BACKGROUND: Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are naturally-occurring filamentous actin-based membranous extensions that form across a wide spectrum of mammalian cell types to facilitate long-range intercellular communication. Valid assays are needed to accurately assess the downstream effects of TNT-mediated transfer of cellular signals in vitro. We recently reported a modified transwell assay system designed to test the effects of intercellular transfer of a therapeutic oncolytic virus, and viral-activated drugs, between cells via TNTs. The objective of the current study was to demonstrate validation of this in vitro approach as a new method for effectively excluding diffusible forms of long- and close-range intercellular transfer of intracytoplasmic cargo, including exosomes/microvesicles and gap junctions in order to isolate TNT-selective cell communication. METHODS: We designed several steps to effectively reduce or eliminate diffusion and long-range transfer via these extracellular vesicles, and used Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis to quantify exosomes following implementation of these steps. RESULTS: The experimental approach outlined here effectively reduced exosome trafficking by >95%; further use of heparin to block exosome uptake by putative recipient cells further impeded transfer of these extracellular vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: This validated assay incorporates several steps that can be taken to quantifiably control for extracellular vesicles in order to perform studies focused on TNT-selective communication.

Stem Cell Res Ther	2017	BACKGROUND: Our study aim was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of miR-133-overexpressing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: Rat MSCs were isolated and purified by whole bone marrow adherent culturing. After transfection with the agomir or antagomir of miR-133, MSCs were collected for assay of cell vitality, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression. At the same time, exosomes were isolated from the supernatant to analyze the paracrine miR-133. For in-vivo studies, constitutive activation of miR-133 in MSCs was achieved by lentivirus-mediated miR-133 overexpression. A rat myocardial infarction model was created by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery, while control MSCs (vector-MSCs) or miR-133-overexpressed MSCs (miR-133-MSCs) were injected into the zone around the myocardial infarction. Subsequently, myocardial function was evaluated by echocardiography on days 7 and 28 post infarction. Finally the infarcted hearts were collected on days 7 and 28 for myocardial infarct size measurement and detection of snail 1 expression. RESULTS: Hypoxia-induced apoptosis of MSCs obviously reduced, along with enhanced expression of total poly ADP-ribose polymerase protein, after miR-133 agomir transfection, while the apoptosis rate increased in MSCs transfected with miR-133 antagomir. However, no change in cell viability and cell-cycle distribution was observed in control, miR-133-overexpressed, and miR-133-interfered MSCs. Importantly, rats transplanted with miR-133-MSCs displayed more improved cardiac function after acute myocardial infarction, compared with those that received vector-MSC injection. Further studies indicated that cardiac expression of snail 1 was significantly repressed by adjacent miR-133-overexpressing MSCs, and both the inflammatory level and the infarct size decreased in miR-133-MSC-injected rat hearts. CONCLUSIONS: miR-133-MSCs obviously improved cardiac function in a rat model of myocardial infarction. Transplantation of miR-133-overexpressing MSCs provides an effective strategy for cardiac repair and modulation of cardiac-related diseases.	PMC5702098

Exosome-Mediated Genetic Information Transfer, a Missing Piece of Osteoblast-Osteoclast Communication Puzzle.	Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)	2017	The skeletal system functions and maintains itself based on communication between cells of diverse origins, especially between osteoblasts (OBs) and osteoclasts (OCs), accounting for bone formation and resorption, respectively. Previously, protein-level information exchange has been the research focus, and this has been discussed in detail. The regulative effects of microRNAs (miRNAs) on OB and OC ignite the question as to whether genetic information could be transferred between bone cells. Exosomes, extracellular membrane vesicles 30-100 nm in diameter, have recently been demonstrated to transfer functional proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs, and serve as mediators of intercellular communication. By reviewing the distinguishing features of exosomes, a hypothesis was formulated and evaluated in this article that exosome-mediated genetic information transfer may represent a novel strategy for OB-OC communication. The exosomes may coordinately regulate these two cells under certain physiological conditions by transferring genetic information. Further research in exosome-shuttered miRNAs in OB-OC communication may add a missing piece to the bone cells communication "puzzle."	PMC5712011

Replenishing exosomes from older bone marrow stromal cells with miR-340 inhibits myeloma-related angiogenesis.	Blood Adv	2017	The study of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and the exosomes they secrete is considered promising for cancer therapy. However, little is known about the effect of donor age on BMSCs. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of BMSC exosomes derived from donors of different ages using an in vivo model of hypoxic bone marrow in multiple myeloma (MM). We found that donor age was strongly related to senescent changes in BMSCs. Exosomes derived from young BMSCs significantly inhibited MM-induced angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs. The exosomal microRNA (miRNA) expression profile was different between young and older BMSCs, despite similarities in the size and quantity of exosomes. Of note was the observation that the antiangiogenic effect of older BMSCs was enhanced by direct transfection of miR-340 that was preferentially expressed in exosomes derived from young BMSCs. We found that miR-340 inhibited angiogenesis via the hepatocyte growth factor/c-MET (HGF/c-MET) signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Our data provide new insights into exosome-based cancer therapy by modification of BMSC-derived exosomes.	PMC5727805

Circular RNA expression in extracellular vesicles isolated from serum of patients with endometrial cancer.	Epigenomics	2018	AIM: We aimed to explore the roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from serum of patients with endometrial cancer. MATERIALS & METHODS: EVs were isolated from serum samples of three patients with stage III adenocarcinoma aged 50-60 years and three matched healthy controls. RNA was extracted from the EVs and analyzed using RNA-seq technique. RESULTS: We got 209 upregulated circRNAs and 66 downregulated circRNAs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated that the differentially expressed circRNAs were enriched in five pathways. The expression level of hsa_circ_0109046 and hsa_circ_0002577 was confirmed using real-time quantitative PCR. CONCLUSION: We identified 275 differentially expressed circRNAs and the expression level of two circRNAs was confirmed using real-time quantitative PCR.

Characterization of exosomes derived from Toxoplasma gondii and their functions in modulating immune responses.	Int J Nanomedicine	2018	Introduction: Exosomes are nanograde membrane-bound vesicles secreted from most cell types through the fusion of multivesicular bodies with plasma membranes. Some of these exosomes are well defined, and are known to have immunomodulatory properties as well as play critical roles in intercellular communications. In this study, we characterized the exosomes derived from Toxoplasma gondii and their functions in aspect of immune responses. Methods: T. gondii exosomes were isolated and identified using electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western blotting. The viability of macrophage RAW264.7 cells affected by exosomes was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit (CCK-8). Then the uptake of T. gondii exosomes by RAW264.7 cells was detected by labeling with fluorescent dye PKH67. After exosomes stimulation, in vitro the production of interleukin (IL)-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-10 in RAW264.7 cells were investigated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In immunized BALB/c mice, the antibodies, cytokines as well as the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were determined using ELISA and flow cytometric analysis. Protective efficacy was evaluated by challenging intraperitoneally with tachyzoites of T. gondii. Results: We successfully isolated and characterized the exosomes derived from T. gondii. Functionally, the viability of macrophage RAW264.7 cells was significantly affected by exosomes at a high concentration (160 μg/mL). The production of IL-12, TNF-α and IFN-γ in macrophage cells were increased, and the level of IL-10 was decreased. Furthermore, BALB/c mice immunized with T. gondii exosomes showed both humoral and cellular immune responses and also exhibited a prolonged survival time. Conclusion: T. gondii exosomes could modulate macrophage activation in vitro and trigger humoral and cellular immune responses and partial protection against acute parasite infection in mice, which suggested that exosomes may serve as a potential candidate against toxoplasmosis.

J Virol	2018	The hepatitis A virus (HAV) cellular receptor 1 (HAVCR1), classified as CD365, was initially discovered as an HAV cellular receptor using an expression cloning strategy. Due to the lack of HAV receptor-negative replication-competent cells, it was not possible to fully prove that HAVCR1 was a functional HAV receptor. However, biochemistry, classical virology, and epidemiology studies further supported the functional role of HAVCR1 as an HAV receptor. Here, we show that an anti-HAVCR1 monoclonal antibody that protected African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cells against HAV infection only partially protected monkey Vero E6 cells and human hepatoma Huh7 cells, indicating that these two cell lines express alternative yet unidentified HAV receptors. Therefore, we focused our work on AGMK cells to further characterize the function of HAVCR1 as an HAV receptor. Advances in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 technology allowed us to knock out the monkey ortholog of HAVCR1 in AGMK cells. The resulting AGMK HAVCR1 knockout (KO) cells lost susceptibility to HAV infection, including HAV-free viral particles (vpHAV) and exosomes purified from HAV-infected cells (exo-HAV). Transfection of HAVCR1 cDNA into AGMK HAVCR1 KO cells restored susceptibility to vpHAV and exo-HAV infection. Furthermore, transfection of the mouse ortholog of HAVCR1, mHavcr1, also restored the susceptibility of AGMK HAVCR1 KO cells to HAV infection. Taken together, our data clearly show that HAVCR1 and mHavcr1 are functional HAV receptors that mediate HAV infection. This work paves the way for the identification of alternative HAV receptors to gain a complete understanding of their interplay with HAVCR1 in the cell entry and pathogenic processes of HAV.IMPORTANCE HAVCR1, an HAV receptor, is expressed in different cell types, including regulatory immune cells and antigen-presenting cells. How HAV evades the immune response during a long incubation period of up to 4 weeks and the mechanism by which the subsequent necroinflammatory process clears the infection remain a puzzle that most likely involves the HAV-HAVCR1 interaction. Based on negative data, a recent paper from the S. M. Lemon and W. Maury laboratories (A. Das, A. Hirai-Yuki, O. Gonzalez-Lopez, B. Rhein, S. Moller-Tank, R. Brouillette, L. Hensley, I. Misumi, W. Lovell, J. M. Cullen, J. K. Whitmire, W. Maury, and S. M. Lemon, mBio 8:e00969-17, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00969-17) suggested that HAVCR1 is not a functional HAV receptor, nor it is it required for HAV infection. However, our data, based on regain of the HAV receptor function in HAVCR1 knockout cells transfected with HAVCR1 cDNA, disagree with their findings. Our positive data show conclusively that HAVCR1 is indeed a functional HAV receptor and lays the ground for the identification of alternative HAV receptors and how they interact with HAVCR1 in cell entry and the pathogenesis of HAV.

Iron Sulfur and Molybdenum Cofactor Enzymes Regulate the Drosophila Life Cycle by Controlling Cell Metabolism.	Front Physiol	2018	Iron sulfur (Fe-S) clusters and the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) are present at enzyme sites, where the active metal facilitates electron transfer. Such enzyme systems are soluble in the mitochondrial matrix, cytosol and nucleus, or embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, but virtually absent from the cell secretory pathway. They are of ancient evolutionary origin supporting respiration, DNA replication, transcription, translation, the biosynthesis of steroids, heme, catabolism of purines, hydroxylation of xenobiotics, and cellular sulfur metabolism. Here, Fe-S cluster and Moco biosynthesis in Drosophila melanogaster is reviewed and the multiple biochemical and physiological functions of known Fe-S and Moco enzymes are described. We show that RNA interference of Mocs3 disrupts Moco biosynthesis and the circadian clock. Fe-S-dependent mitochondrial respiration is discussed in the context of germ line and somatic development, stem cell differentiation and aging. The subcellular compartmentalization of the Fe-S and Moco assembly machinery components and their connections to iron sensing mechanisms and intermediary metabolism are emphasized. A biochemically active Fe-S core complex of heterologously expressed fly Nfs1, Isd11, IscU, and human frataxin is presented. Based on the recent demonstration that copper displaces the Fe-S cluster of yeast and human ferredoxin, an explanation for why high dietary copper leads to cytoplasmic iron deficiency in flies is proposed. Another proposal that exosomes contribute to the transport of xanthine dehydrogenase from peripheral tissues to the eye pigment cells is put forward, where the Vps16a subunit of the HOPS complex may have a specialized role in concentrating this enzyme within pigment granules. Finally, we formulate a hypothesis that (i) mitochondrial superoxide mobilizes iron from the Fe-S clusters in aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase; (ii) increased iron transiently displaces manganese on superoxide dismutase, which may function as a mitochondrial iron sensor since it is inactivated by iron; (iii) with the Krebs cycle thus disrupted, citrate is exported to the cytosol for fatty acid synthesis, while succinyl-CoA and the iron are used for heme biosynthesis; (iv) as iron is used for heme biosynthesis its concentration in the matrix drops allowing for manganese to reactivate superoxide dismutase and Fe-S cluster biosynthesis to reestablish the Krebs cycle.

Roles of Macrophage Exosomes in Immune Response to Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate Crystals.	Front Immunol	2018	In kidney stone disease, macrophages secrete various mediators via classical secretory pathway and cause renal interstitial inflammation. However, whether their extracellular vesicles, particularly exosomes, are involved in kidney stone pathogenesis remained unknown. This study investigated alterations in exosomal proteome of U937-derived macrophages (by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate activation) after exposure to calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals for 16-h using 2-DE-based proteomics approach. Six significantly altered proteins in COM-treated exosomes were successfully identified by nanoscale liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-electron transfer dissociation tandem mass spectrometry as proteins involved mainly in immune processes, including T-cell activation and homeostasis, Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) regulation, and cell migration/movement. The decreased heat shock protein 90-beta (HSP90β) and increased vimentin were confirmed by Western blotting. ELISA showed that the COM-treated macrophages produced greater level of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), one of the markers for inflammasome activation. Functional studies demonstrated that COM-treated exosomes enhanced monocyte and T-cell migration, monocyte activation and macrophage phagocytic activity, but on the other hand, reduced T-cell activation. In addition, COM-treated exosomes enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 by monocytes that could be restored to its basal level by small-interfering RNA targeting on vimentin (si-Vimentin). Moreover, si-Vimentin could also abolish effects of COM-treated exosomes on monocyte and T-cell migration as well as macrophage phagocytic activity. These findings provided some implications to the immune response during kidney stone pathogenesis via exosomal pathway of macrophages after exposure to COM crystals.	PMC5835051

Cell Death Dis	2018	Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a major component of the tumor microenvironment and have been shown to contribute to tumor aggressiveness. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the pro-metastatic effect of TAMs on gastric cancer are not clearly defined. Here, we show that TAMs are enriched in gastric cancer. TAMs are characterized by M2-polarized phenotype and promote migration of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we find that M2-derived exosomes determine the TAMs-mediated pro-migratory activity. Using mass spectrometry, we identify that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is highly specific and effective protein in M2 macrophages-derived exosomes. Moreover, TAMs are uniquely immune cells population expressed ApoE in gastric cancer microenvironment. However, exosomes derived from M2 macrophages of Apoe -/- mice have no significant effect on the migration of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, M2 macrophage-derived exosomes mediate an intercellular transfer of ApoE-activating PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in recipient gastric cancer cells to remodel the cytoskeleton-supporting migration. Collectively, our findings signify that the exosome-mediated transfer of functional ApoE protein from TAMs to the tumor cells promotes the migration of gastric cancer cells.	
29630521	Hai-Jiang Wang				Prognostic and predictive value of long non-coding RNA GAS5 and mircoRNA-221 in colorectal cancer and their effects on colorectal cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion.	Cancer Biomark	2018	BACKGROUND: LncRNA and microRNA play an important role in the development of human cancers; they can act as a tumor suppressor gene or an oncogene. LncRNA GAS5, originating from the separation from tumor suppressor gene cDNA subtractive library, is considered as an oncogene in several kinds of cancers. The expression of miR-221 affects tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis in multiple types of human cancers. However, there's very little information on the role LncRNA GAS5 and miR-221 play in CRC. Therefore, we conducted this study in order to analyze the association of GAS5 and miR-221 with the prognosis of CRC and preliminary study was done on proliferation, metastasis and invasion of CRC cells. In the present study, we demonstrate the predictive value of long non-coding RNA GAS5 (lncRNA GAS5) and mircoRNA-221 (miR-221) in the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) and their effects on CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-eight cases with CRC patients and 173 cases of healthy subjects that with no abnormalities, who've been diagnosed through colonoscopy between January 2012 and January 2014 were selected for the study. After the clinicopathological data of the subjects, tissue, plasma and exosomes were collected, lncRNA GAS5 and miR-221 expressions in tissues, plasma and exosomes were measured by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The diagnostic values of lncRNA GAS5 and miR-221 expression in tissues, plasma and exosomes in patients with CRC were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Lentiviral vector was constructed for the overexpression of lncRNA GAS5, and SW480 cell line was used for the transfection of the experiment and assigned into an empty vector and GAS5 groups. The cell proliferation, migration and invasion were tested using a cell counting kit-8 assay and Transwell assay respectively. RESULTS: The results revealed that LncRNA GAS5 is upregulated while the miR-221 is downregulated in the tissues, plasma and exosomes of patients with CRC. The results of ROC showed that the expressions of both lncRNA GAS5 and miR-221 in the tissues, plasma and exosomes had diagnostic value in CRC. While the LncRNA GAS5 expression in tissues, plasma and exosomes were associated with the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, Dukes stage, lymph node metastasis (LNM), local recurrence rate and distant metastasis rate, the MiR-221 expression in tissues, plasma and exosomes were associated with tumor size, TNM stage, Dukes stage, LNM, local recurrence rate and distant metastasis rate. LncRNA GAS5 and miR-221 expression in tissues, plasma and exosomes were found to be independent prognostic factors for CRC. Following the overexpression of GAS5, the GAS5 expressions was up-regulated and miR-221 expression was down-regulated; the rate of cell proliferation, migration and invasion were decreased.

J Lipid Res	2018	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes and microvesicles, are small membrane-bound vesicles released by cells under various conditions. In a multitude of physiological and pathological conditions, EVs contribute to intercellular communication by facilitating exchange of material between cells. Rapidly growing interest is aimed at better understanding EV function and their use as biomarkers. The vast EV cargo includes cytokines, growth factors, organelles, nucleic acids (messenger and micro RNA), and transcription factors. A large proportion of research dedicated to EVs is focused on their microRNA cargo; however, much less is known about other EV constituents, in particular eicosanoids. These potent bioactive lipid mediators, derived from arachidonic acid, are shuttled in EVs along with the enzymes in charge of their synthesis. In the extracellular milieu, EVs also interact with secreted phospholipases to generate eicosanoids, which then regulate the transfer of cargo into a cellular recipient. Eicosanoids are useful as biomarkers and contribute to a variety of biological functions, including modulation of distal immune responses. Here, we review the reported roles of eicosanoids conveyed by EVs and describe their potential as biomarker.

Cell Death Dis	2018	Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Approximately 70-90% of primary liver cancers are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently, HCC patient prognosis is unsatisfactory due to high metastasis and/or post-surgical recurrence rates. Therefore, new therapeutic methods for inhibiting metastasis and recurrence are urgently needed. Exosomes are small lipid-bilayer vesicles that are implicated in tumour development and metastasis. Rab27a, a small GTPase, regulates exosome secretion by mediating multivesicular endosome docking at the plasma membrane. However, whether Rab27a participates in HCC cell-derived exosome exocytosis is unclear. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) frequently initiates metastasis. The role of HCC cell-derived exosomes in EMT remains unknown. We found that exosomes from highly metastatic MHCC97H cells could communicate with low metastatic HCC cells, increasing their migration, chemotaxis and invasion. Rab27a knockdown inhibited MHCC97H-derived exosome secretion, which consequently promoted migration, chemotaxis and invasion in parental MHCC97H cells. Mechanistic studies showed that the biological alterations in HCC cells treated with MHCC97H-derived exosomes or MHCC97H cells with reduced self-derived exosome secretion were caused by inducing EMT via MAPK/ERK signalling. Animal experiments indicated that exosome secretion blockade was associated with enhanced lung and intrahepatic metastasis of parental MHCC97H cells, while ectopic overexpression of Rab27a in MHCC97H cells could rescue this enhancement of metastasis in vivo. Injection of MHCC97H cell-derived exosomes through the tail vein promoted intrahepatic recurrence of HLE tumours in vivo. Clinically, Rab27a was positively associated with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, vascular invasion and liver cirrhosis. Our study elucidated the role of exosomes in HCC metastasis and recurrence, suggesting that they are promising therapeutic and prognostic targets for HCC patients.	PMC5938707

Int J Biol Macromol	2018	One homogeneous polysaccharide (ZWP) was successfully isolated and purified from the rhizomes of Curcuma zedoaria and the aim of present study was to determine the potential of chitosan/silk hydrogel sponge loaded with platelet-rich plasma exosomes (PRP-Exos), ZWP or PRP-Exos/ZWP on wound-healing in diabetic rats. An in vivo diabetic wound healing study showed that separate or combined treatments all resulted in a wound contraction in diabetic rats, as evidenced by a decrease of ulcer and an increase of epidermal thickness, but PRP-Exos/ZWP combination therapy was more successful in wound closing than either PRP-Exos or ZWP single administration. This could be due to the upregulation of collagen synthesis and deposition, as well as angiogenesis at the wound site. In addition to this, no side effects was observed in all treated groups during healing process. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for PRP-Exos/ZWP as a potential therapeutic strategy to accelerate skin repair in diabetes.

Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci	2003	PURPOSE: Hr44 is a target antigen for cross-reactive antibodies to the Onchocerca volvulus antigen Ov39. This study was undertaken to determine the epitopes recognized by antibodies to hr44, including Ov39/hr44 cross-reacting antibodies, and to use these antibodies to determine the distribution of hr44 in normal and inflamed intraocular epithelia and ARPE-19 cell cultures. METHODS: Epitopes were identified with a peptide-based ELISA and competition ELISA. Immunostaining for hr44 and CD63 was conducted on control and inflamed ocular tissues. Exosomes were isolated from ARPE-19 cell cultures and analyzed by Western blot and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Linear epitopes and the Ov39 cross-reactive epitope of hr44 were identified. Immunohistology indicated that hr44 is present in vesicular structures of the iris and ciliary body and is lost from the epithelial layers of inflamed eyes coincidentally with CD63. A 66-kDa variant of hr44 is present in exosomes purified from ARPE-19 cell culture supernatants. CONCLUSIONS: Because hr44 is a component of exosomes produced by ARPE-19 cells, the coincident loss of hr44 and CD63 in inflamed epithelia indicates that exosomes may be released from intraocular epithelia in response to inflammation. This notion suggests that exosomes shed by intraocular epithelial cells influence T-cell survival and antigen presentation in the eye without direct cell-cell contact and have a role in the maintenance of ocular immune privilege.	
15880835	Menelaos N Manoussakis	National University of Athens, Athens, Greece.			Salivary gland epithelial cell exosomes: A source of autoantigenic ribonucleoproteins.	Arthritis Rheum	2005	OBJECTIVE: Exosomes are membrane vesicles of endosomal origin that are distinct from apoptotic bodies and are thought to represent an acellular mechanism for antigen transfer to classic antigen-presenting cells, as well as for direct antigen presentation with the capacity to induce immune response or tolerance. Nevertheless, it is not known whether exosomes are involved in the induction or regulation of immune responses against intracellular autoantigens that characterize autoimmune diseases. Exosomes have been shown to be secreted by several types of cells, whereas studies of non-neoplastic epithelial cells are lacking. This study was undertaken to investigate the capacity of non-neoplastic salivary gland epithelial cells (SGECs) to release exosomes, and to determine whether epithelial exosomes contain RNPs, which are major autoantigens in systemic rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation from culture supernatants of 26 non-neoplastic SGEC lines established from patients with various rheumatic disorders. They were analyzed by electron microscopy, immunoblotting, or immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: All SGEC lines were found to release comparable and significant amounts of exosomes. Similar to other cell systems, exosome secretion was constitutive and was unrelated to activation or apoptotic processes. SGEC-derived exosomes were found to contain the autoantigenic Ro/SSA, La/SSB, and Sm RNPs, as well as epithelial-specific cytokeratins. CONCLUSION: SGECs constitutively secrete exosomes that contain the major autoantigens Ro/SSA, La/SSB, and Sm. This mechanism may represent a pathway whereby intracellular autoantigens are presented to the immune system with an immunogenic or tolerogenic outcome.

For phenotypic analysis BL6-10 and F1 melanoma cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-MHC I (H-2K(b)), MHC II (Ia(b)) and Met 72 antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. C57BL/6 mice (8 per group) were injected (i. v.) with 0.5 x 10(6) F1, BL6-10 and F1(EXO) melanoma cells. Lungs were removed 4 weeks after tumor cell injection, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. RESULTS: Data revealed that BL6-10 cells expressed metastasis marker (Met 72 tumor antigen), while F1 cells did not display this cell surface marker. All mice inoculated with BL6-10 melanoma cells had numerous lung tumor colonies, while mice injected with F1 tumor cells were free of lung metastatic colonies. BL6-10 tumor cells-released EXO also expressed Met 72 tumor antigen as BL6-10 tumor cells, but in less amount. F1 tumor cells can uptake EXO from BL6-10 tumor cells and express acquired exosomal Met 72 tumor antigen. CONCLUSION: The metastatic activity of highly metastatic BL6-10 tumor cells can be transferred to poorly metastatic F1 tumor cells by uptake of highly metastatic BL6-10 tumor-released EXO.

J Immunol	2007	Exosomes are secreted vesicles formed in late endocytic compartments. Mature dendritic cells (DCs) secrete exosomes bearing functional MHC-peptide complexes and high levels of ICAM-1. Such exosomes can activate Ag-specific naive T cells but only after recapture by recipient APCs. In this study, we addressed the molecular mechanisms of interaction between exosomes and recipient DCs. We show that exosomes can be presented by mouse DCs without the need for internalization and processing. Exosomes interact with DCs through a specific saturable receptor. Although the two major ligands of ICAM-1, LFA-1 and Mac-1, are expressed by lymphoid organ DCs, only LFA-1 is required for exosome capture by these cells. Accordingly, we show that CD8(+) DCs express higher levels of LFA-1 than CD8(-) DCs, and that they are the main recipients of exosomes in vivo. We propose a new role for LFA-1 on DCs, as a receptor for exosomes to favor Ag transfer between DCs in vivo.

Mol Ther	2008	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles that are secreted by a multitude of cell types. The exosomes derived from dendritic cells (Dex), tumor cells (Tex), and malignant effusions demonstrate immunomodulatory functions, and are even under clinical trial for cancer treatments. In this study we report the phase I clinical trial of the ascites-derived exosomes (Aex) in combination with the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the immunotherapy of colorectal cancer (CRC). The Aex isolated by sucrose/D(2)O density gradient ultracentrifugation are 60-90-nm vesicles that contain the diverse immunomodulatory markers of exosomes and tumor-associated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Totally 40 patients (HLA-A0201(+)CEA(+)) with advanced CRC were enrolled in the study, and randomly assigned to treatments with Aex alone or Aex plus GM-CSF. Patients in both groups received a total of four subcutaneous immunizations at weekly intervals. We found that both therapies were safe and well tolerated, and that Aex plus GM-CSF but not Aex alone can induce beneficial tumor-specific antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Therefore, our study suggests that the immunotherapy of CRC with Aex in combination with GM-CSF is feasible and safe, and thus can serve as an alternative choice in the immunotherapy of advanced CRC.

Prostate	2009	BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, and early detection is essential to reduce mortality and increase survival. delta-Catenin is a unique beta-catenin superfamily protein primarily expressed in the brain but is upregulated in human prostatic adenocarcinomas. Despite its close correlation with the disease, it is unclear whether delta-catenin presents the potential in prostate cancer screening because it is an intracellular protein. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis of delta-catenin accumulation in the urine of prostate cancer patients and its potential pathways of excretion into extracellular milieu. METHODS: Prostate cancer cell cultures, human tissue biopsies, and voided urines were characterized to determine extracellular delta-catenin accumulation and co-isolation with exosomes/prostasomes. RESULTS: We identified delta-catenin in culture media and in the stroma of human prostate cancer tissues. In PC-3 cells in culture, delta-catenin was partially co-localized and co-isolated with raft-associated membrane protein caveolin-1 and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein CD59, suggesting its potential excretion into extracellular milieu through exosome/prostasome associated pathways. Interference with endocytic pathway using wortmannin did not block prostasome excretion, but delta-catenin overexpression promoted the extracellular accumulation of caveolin-1. delta-Catenin, caveolin-1, and CD59 were all detected in cell-free human voided urine prostasomes. delta-Catenin immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the urine of prostate cancer patients (P < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated, for the first time, the extracellular accumulation of delta-catenin in urine supporting its potential utility for non-invasive prostate cancer detection.

Sorting of MHC class II molecules into exosomes through a ubiquitin-independent pathway.	Traffic	2009	Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules accumulate in exocytic vesicles, called exosomes, which are secreted by antigen presenting cells. These vesicles are released following the fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanisms regulating cargo selection remain to be fully characterized. As ubiquitination of the MHC-II beta-chain cytoplasmic tail has recently been demonstrated in various cell types, we sought to determine if this post-translational modification is required for the incorporation of MHC-II molecules into exosomes. First, we stably transfected HeLa cells with a chimeric HLA-DR molecule in which the beta-chain cytoplasmic tail is replaced by ubiquitin. Western blot analysis did not indicate preferential shedding of these chimeric molecules into exosomes. Next, we forced the ubiquitination of MHC-II in class II transactivator (CIITA)-expressing HeLa and HEK293 cells by transfecting the MARCH8 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Despite the almost complete downregulation of MHC-II from the plasma membrane, these molecules were not enriched in exosomes. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis of all cytoplasmic lysine residues on HLA-DR did not prevent inclusion into these vesicles. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ubiquitination of MHC-II is not a prerequisite for incorporation into exosomes.

Immunoscreening of the extracellular proteome of colorectal cancer cells.	BMC Cancer	2010	BACKGROUND: The release of proteins from tumors can trigger an immune response in cancer patients involving T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, which results in the generation of antibodies to tumor-derived proteins. Many studies aim to use humoral immune responses, namely autoantibody profiles, directly, as clinical biomarkers. Alternatively, the antibody immune response as an amplification system for tumor associated alterations may be used to indicate putative protein biomarkers with high sensitivity. Aiming at the latter approach we here have implemented an autoantibody profiling strategy which particularly focuses on proteins released by tumor cells in vitro: the so-called secretome. METHODS: For immunoscreening, the extracellular proteome of five colorectal cancer cell lines was resolved on 2D gels, immobilized on PVDF membranes and used for serological screening with individual sera from 21 colorectal cancer patients and 24 healthy controls. All of the signals from each blot were assigned to a master map, and autoantigen candidates were defined based of the pattern of immunoreactivities. The corresponding proteins were isolated from preparative gels, identified by MALDI-MS and/or by nano-HPLC/ESI-MS/MS and exemplarily confirmed by duplex Western blotting combining the human serum samples with antibodies directed against the protein(s) of interest. RESULTS: From 281 secretome proteins stained with autoantibodies in total we first defined the "background patterns" of frequently immunoreactive extracellular proteins in healthy and diseased people. An assignment of these proteins, among them many nominally intracellular proteins, to the subset of exosomal proteins within the secretomes revealed a large overlap. On this basis we defined and consequently confirmed novel biomarker candidates such as the extreme C-terminus of the extracellular matrix protein agrin within the set of cancer-enriched immunoreactivities. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest, first, that autoantibody responses may be due, in large part, to cross-presentation of antigens to the immune system via exosomes, membrane vesicles released by tumor cells and constituting a significant fraction of the secretome. In addition, this immunosecretomics approach has revealed novel biomarker candidates, some of them secretome-specific, and thus serves as a promising complementary tool to the frequently reported immunoproteomic studies for biomarker discovery.

TLR2-mediated expansion of MDSCs is dependent on the source of tumor exosomes.	Am J Pathol	2010	Exosomes released from tumor cells having been shown to induce interleukin-6 release from myeloid-derived suppressor cells in a Toll-like receptor 2/Stat3-dependent manner. In this study, we show that exosomes released from tumor cells re-isolated from syngeneic mice are capable of inducing interleukin-6 in a Toll-like receptor 2-independent manner, whereas the data generated from exosomes of tumor cells having undergone numerous in vitro passages induce interleukin-6 in a Toll-like receptor 2-dependent manner. This discrepancy may be due to the source of tumor cells used to generate the exosomes for this study. These results suggest that exosomes released from tumor cells that are not within a tumor microenvironment may not realistically represent the role of tumor exosomes in vivo. This is an important consideration since frequently passing tumor cells in vivo is an accepted practice for studying tumor exosome-mediated inflammatory responses.	PMC2947257

Proteomics Clin Appl	2010	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to address the hypothesis that small vesicular urinary particles known as exosomes could be selectively microfiltered using low protein-binding size exclusion filters, thereby simplifying their use in clinical biomarker discovery studies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We characterized a microfiltration approach using a low protein binding, hydrophilized polyvinylidene difluoride membrane to easily and efficiently isolate urinary exosomes from fresh, room temperature or 4°C urine, with a simultaneous depletion of abundant urinary proteins. Using LC-MS, immunoblot analysis, and electron microscopy methods, we demonstrate this method to isolate intact exosomes and thereby enrich for a low abundant urinary proteome. RESULTS: In comparison to other standard methods of exosome isolation including ultracentrifugation and nanofiltration, we demonstrate equivalent enrichment of the exosome proteome with reduced co-purification of abundant urinary proteins. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In conclusion, we demonstrate a microfiltration isolation method that preserves the exosome structure, reduces contamination from higher abundant urinary proteins, and can be easily implemented into mass spectrometry analysis for biomarker discovery efforts or incorporation into routine clinical laboratory applications to yield higher sample throughput.

Electrophoresis	2011	In the present research, we aimed to screen for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-related proteins in urinary exosomes by comparing urinary exosomes proteome of normal controls and NSCLC patients. Urinary exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and identified by electron microscopy. Exosomal proteins were separated by 1-D SDS-PAGE and the differentially expressed bands between healthy controls and NSCLC patients ranging in size from 35 to 45 kD were cut from the gel. After tryptic digestion, 18 proteins were identified by nano-HPLC-chip-MS/MS. The differential expression of leucine-rich α-2-glycoprotein (LRG1) was further validated in urinary exosomes by Western blot and in lung tissue by immunohistochemistry. The LRG1 was found to be expressed at higher levels in urinary exosomes and lung tissue of NSCLC patients. These results suggested that LRG1 may be a candidate biomarker for non-invasive diagnosis of NSCLC in urine.

Exosome nanotechnology: an emerging paradigm shift in drug delivery: exploitation of exosome nanovesicles for systemic in vivo delivery of RNAi heralds new horizons for drug delivery across biological barriers.	Bioessays	2011	The demonstration that dendritic cell (DC)-derived exosomes can be exploited for targeted RNAi delivery to the brain after systemic injection provides the first proof-of-concept for the potential of these naturally occurring vesicles as vehicles of drug delivery. As well as being amenable to existing in vivo targeting strategies already in use for viruses and liposomes, this novel approach offers the added advantages of in vivo safety and low immunogenicity. Fulfilment of the potential of exosome delivery methods warrants a better understanding of their biology, as well as the development of novel production, characterisation, targeting and cargo-loading nanotechnologies. Ultimately, exosome-mediated drug delivery promises to overcome important challenges in the field of therapeutics, such as delivery of drugs across otherwise impermeable biological barriers, such as the blood brain barrier, and using patient-derived tissue as a source of individualised and biocompatible therapeutic drug delivery vehicles.

Immunology	2012	Nanoparticle tracking analysis permits the determination of both the size distribution and relative concentration of microvesicles, including exosomes, in the supernatants of cultured cells and biological fluids. We have studied the release of microvesicles from the human lymphoblastoid T-cell lines Jurkat and CEM. Unstimulated, both cell lines release microvesicles in the size range 70-90 nm, which can be depleted from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 100 000 g, and by anti-CD45 magnetic beads, and which by immunoblotting also contain the exosome-associated proteins Alix and Tsg101. Incubation with known potentiators of exosome release, the ionophores monensin and A23187, resulted in a significant increase in microvesicle release that was both time and concentration dependent. Mass spectrometric analysis of proteins isolated from ultracentrifuged supernatants of A23187-treated cells revealed the presence of exosome-associated proteins including heat-shock protein 90, tubulin, elongation factor α1, actin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Additionally, treatment of peripheral blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharide displayed an increase in secreted microvesicles. Consequently, nanoparticle tracking analysis can be effectively applied to monitor microvesicle release from cells of the immune system.	PMC3403268

Exosome-mediated transfer of miR-133b from multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells to neural cells contributes to neurite outgrowth.	Stem Cells	2012	Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have potential therapeutic benefit for the treatment of neurological diseases and injury. MSCs interact with and alter brain parenchymal cells by direct cell-cell communication and/or by indirect secretion of factors and thereby promote functional recovery. In this study, we found that MSC treatment of rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) significantly increased microRNA 133b (miR-133b) level in the ipsilateral hemisphere. In vitro, miR-133b levels in MSCs and in their exosomes increased after MSCs were exposed to ipsilateral ischemic tissue extracts from rats subjected to MCAo. miR-133b levels were also increased in primary cultured neurons and astrocytes treated with the exosome-enriched fractions released from these MSCs. Knockdown of miR-133b in MSCs confirmed that the increased miR-133b level in astrocytes is attributed to their transfer from MSCs. Further verification of this exosome-mediated intercellular communication was performed using a cel-miR-67 luciferase reporter system and an MSC-astrocyte coculture model. Cel-miR-67 in MSCs was transferred to astrocytes via exosomes between 50 and 100 nm in diameter. Our data suggest that the cel-miR-67 released from MSCs was primarily contained in exosomes. A gap junction intercellular communication inhibitor arrested the exosomal microRNA communication by inhibiting exosome release. Cultured neurons treated with exosome-enriched fractions from MSCs exposed to 72 hours post-MCAo brain extracts significantly increased the neurite branch number and total neurite length. This study provides the first demonstration that MSCs communicate with brain parenchymal cells and may regulate neurite outgrowth by transfer of miR-133b to neural cells via exosomes.	PMC3495063

Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab	2012	Ovariectomy/estrogen deficiency causes selective apoptosis of the serous epithelial cells of the submandibular glands (SMG) in female mice. Because such apoptosis does not occur in healthy, estrogen-deficient male mice, it was hypothesized that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) protects epithelial SMG cells against apoptosis. The antiapoptotic effect of DHT on human epithelial HSG cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor-α and cycloheximide was studied. Correspondingly, the proapoptotic effect of androgen deficiency was studied in orchiectomized (ORX) androgen-knockout (ARKO) and wild-type (WT) mice. The health state of the SMG cells was studied with Alcian blue-periodic acid Schiff (AB-PAS) and amylase staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The eventual protective antiapoptotic effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) treatment was tested in this model. Apoptosis was assessed using immunohistochemisty of cleaved effector caspase-3 and its activator caspase-8 and the TUNEL assay. To test for the bioavailability, intracrine metabolism and sex steroid effects of DHEA, cystein-rich secretory protein-3 (CRISP-3), and leucine-isoleucine-valine transport system 1 (LIV-1) were used as androgen- and estrogen-regulated biomarkers, respectively. DHT protected HSG cells against induced apoptosis. In mice, androgen deficiency resulted in extensive activation of apoptotic caspase-8/3 cascade in serous epithelial cells. However, in salivary glands, active caspases were not translocated to nuclei but secreted to salivary ducts in exosome-like particles, which are associated with weak AB-PAS and amylase staining of the androgen-deprived cells and reduced number of intracellular secretory granules. DHEA treatment suppressed induction of proapoptotic caspases and almost normalized mucins and amylase and ultramophology of the serous epithelial cells in WT ORX but not ARKO ORX mice. According to the CRISP-3 and LIV-1 markers, DHEA probably exerted its effects via intracrine conversion to DHT.

Cancer Res	2013	Extrinsic signaling cues in the microenvironment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) contribute to disease progression and therapy resistance. Yet, it remains unknown how the bone marrow niche in which AML arises is subverted to support leukemic persistence at the expense of homeostatic function. Exosomes are cell membrane-derived vesicles carrying protein and RNA cargoes that have emerged as mediators of cell-cell communication. In this study, we examined the role of exosomes in developing the AML niche of the bone marrow microenvironment, investigating their biogenesis with a focus on RNA trafficking. We found that both primary AML and AML cell lines released exosome-sized vesicles that entered bystander cells. These exosomes were enriched for several coding and noncoding RNAs relevant to AML pathogenesis. Furthermore, their uptake by bone marrow stromal cells altered their secretion of growth factors. Proof-of-concept studies provided additional evidence for the canonical functions of the transferred RNA. Taken together, our findings revealed that AML exosome trafficking alters the proliferative, angiogenic, and migratory responses of cocultured stromal and hematopoietic progenitor cell lines, helping explain how the microenvironmental niche becomes reprogrammed during invasion of the bone marrow by AML.

BM mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes facilitate multiple myeloma progression.	J Clin Invest	2013	BM mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) support multiple myeloma (MM) cell growth, but little is known about the putative mechanisms by which the BM microenvironment plays an oncogenic role in this disease. Cell-cell communication is mediated by exosomes. In this study, we showed that MM BM-MSCs release exosomes that are transferred to MM cells, thereby resulting in modulation of tumor growth in vivo. Exosomal microRNA (miR) content differed between MM and normal BM-MSCs, with a lower content of the tumor suppressor miR-15a. In addition, MM BM-MSC-derived exosomes had higher levels of oncogenic proteins, cytokines, and adhesion molecules compared with exosomes from the cells of origin. Importantly, whereas MM BM-MSC-derived exosomes promoted MM tumor growth, normal BM-MSC exosomes inhibited the growth of MM cells. In summary, these in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that exosome transfer from BM-MSCs to clonal plasma cells represents a previously undescribed and unique mechanism that highlights the contribution of BM-MSCs to MM disease progression.

MiR-133b promotes neural plasticity and functional recovery after treatment of stroke with multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in rats via transfer of exosome-enriched extracellular particles.	Stem Cells	2013	To test, in vivo, the hypothesis that exosomes from multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) mediate microRNA 133b (miR-133b) transfer which promotes neurological recovery from stroke, we used knockin and knockdown technologies to upregulate or downregulate the miR-133b level in MSCs (miR-133b(+) MSCs or miR-133b(-) MSCs) and their corresponding exosomes, respectively. Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and were treated with naïve MSCs, miR-133b(+) MSCs, or miR-133b(-) MSC at 1 day after MCAo. Compared with controls, rats receiving naïve MSC treatment significantly improved functional recovery and exhibited increased axonal plasticity and neurite remodeling in the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) at day 14 after MCAo. The outcomes were significantly enhanced with miR-133b(+) MSC treatment, and were significantly decreased with miR-133b(-) MSC treatment, compared to naïve MSC treatment. The miR-133b level in exosomes collected from the cerebral spinal fluid was significantly increased after miR-133b(+) MSC treatment, and was significantly decreased after miR-133b(-) MSC treatment at day 14 after MCAo, compared to naïve MSC treatment. Tagging exosomes with green fluorescent protein demonstrated that exosomes-enriched extracellular particles were released from MSCs and transferred to adjacent astrocytes and neurons. The expression of selective targets for miR-133b, connective tissue growth factor and ras homolog gene family member A, was significantly decreased in the IBZ after miR-133b(+) MSC treatment, while their expression remained at similar elevated levels after miR-133b(-) MSC treatment, compared to naïve MSC treatment. Collectively, our data suggest that exosomes from MSCs mediate the miR-133b transfer to astrocytes and neurons, which regulate gene expression, subsequently benefit neurite remodeling and functional recovery after stroke.

Human placental trophoblasts confer viral resistance to recipient cells.	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2013	Placental trophoblasts form the interface between the fetal and maternal environments and serve to limit the maternal-fetal spread of viruses. Here we show that cultured primary human placental trophoblasts are highly resistant to infection by a number of viruses and, importantly, confer this resistance to nonplacental recipient cells by exosome-mediated delivery of specific microRNAs (miRNAs). We show that miRNA members of the chromosome 19 miRNA cluster, which are almost exclusively expressed in the human placenta, are packaged within trophoblast-derived exosomes and attenuate viral replication in recipient cells by the induction of autophagy. Together, our findings identify an unprecedented paracrine and/or systemic function of placental trophoblasts that uses exosome-mediated transfer of a unique set of placental-specific effector miRNAs to directly communicate with placental or maternal target cells and regulate their immunity to viral infections.

Characterization of mRNA and microRNA in human mast cell-derived exosomes and their transfer to other mast cells and blood CD34 progenitor cells.	J Extracell Vesicles	2012	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are nanosized vesicles of endocytic origin that are released into the extracellular environment by many different cells. It has been shown that exosomes from various cellular origins contain a substantial amount of RNA (mainly mRNA and microRNA). More importantly, exosomes are capable of delivering their RNA content to target cells, which is a novel way of cell-to-cell communication. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether exosomal shuttle RNA could play a role in the communication between human mast cells and between human mast cells and human CD34(+) progenitor cells. METHODS: The mRNA and microRNA content of exosomes from a human mast cell line, HMC-1, was analysed by using microarray technology. Co-culture experiments followed by flow cytometry analysis and confocal microscopy as well as radioactive labeling experiments were performed to examine the uptake of these exosomes and the shuttle of the RNA to other mast cells and CD34(+) progenitor cells. RESULTS: In this study, we show that human mast cells release RNA-containing exosomes, with the capacity to shuttle RNA between cells. Interestingly, by using microRNA microarray analysis, 116 microRNAs could be identified in the exosomes and 134 microRNAs in the donor mast cells. Furthermore, DNA microarray experiments revealed the presence of approximately 1800 mRNAs in the exosomes, which represent 15% of the donor cell mRNA content. In addition, transfer experiments revealed that exosomes can shuttle RNA between human mast cells and to CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that exosomal shuttle RNA (esRNA) can play a role in the communication between cells, including mast cells and CD34(+) progenitor cells, implying a role in cells maturation process.

Clin Chim Acta	2014	AIMS: Podocyte injury plays an important role in the pathogenesis of kidney disease. Urinary exosomes are microvesicles released by tubular epithelial cells and podocytes containing information of their originated cells. This study investigated for the first time whether podocyte related mRNA in urinary exosome could serve as novel biomarkers for kidney disease. METHODS: Urine samples were collected from 32 patients of kidney disease who underwent kidney biopsy and 7 controls. CD2AP, NPHS2 and synaptopodin were detected by real-time RT-PCR on RNA isolated from urinary exosome. RESULTS: The pellet microvesicles were positively stained with exosome and podocyte marker, AQP2, CD9 and nephrin. CD2AP mRNA was lower (p=0.008) in kidney disease patients compared with controls and decreased with the increasing severity of proteinuria (p=0.06). CD2AP correlated with serum creatinine (r=-0.373, p=0.035), BUN (r=-0.445, p=0.009) and eGFR (r=0.351, p=0.046). Neither NPHS2 nor synaptopodin correlated with parameters of renal function. CD2AP mRNA correlated negatively with 24 hour urine protein (r=-0.403, p=0.022), severity of tubulointerstitial fibrosis (r=-0.394, p=0.026) and glomerulosclerosis (r=-0.389, p=0.031) and could discriminate kidney disease from controls with AUC of 0.821 (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Urinary exosome mRNA of CD2AP might be a non-invasive tool for detecting both renal function and fibrosis of kidney disease.

J Invest Dermatol	2014	H19 non-coding RNA downregulation stimulates melanogenesis in melasma patients. However, its mechanism is unclear. In this study, the potential role of a H19 microRNA, miR-675, in melanogenesis was examined. Real-time PCR using cultured normal human skin keratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblasts with or without H19 knockdown showed accompanying changes between expression levels of H19 and those of miR-675 in keratinocytes. MiR-675 was also detected in concentrated culture supernatants and showed expression levels parallel with those of cell lysates. In addition to RNase resistance, FACS analysis showed anti-CD63-positive exosomes in culture supernatants, suggesting miR-675 could be released extracellularly and delivered to neighboring cells without degradation. In western blot analysis, the miR-675 mimic reduced the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase, whereas these expressions were increased by the miR-675 inhibitor. Although H19 was not a miR-675 target, luciferase reporter assay showed a direct binding of miR-675 to 3'-untranslated region of MITF. In addition, localized in vivo miR-675 overexpression in mouse using a cationic polymer transfection reagent showed reduced mRNA expression levels of MITF, tyrosinase, tyrosine-related protein-1 (Trp-1), and Trp-2. Collectively, the results suggest that miR-675 derived from keratinocytes could be involved in H19-stimulated melanogenesis using MITF as a target of miR-675.

Diagnostic biomarkers would be clinically meaningful to allow for early detection of the tumor and for those cases in which surgery is contraindicated or biopsy results are inconclusive. Recent findings show that GBM cells release microvesicles that contain a select subset of cellular proteins and RNA. The aim of this hypothesis-generating study was to assess the diagnostic potential of miRNAs found in microvesicles isolated from the serum of GBM patients. METHODS: To control disease heterogeneity, we used patients with newly diagnosed GBM. In the discovery stage, PCR-based TaqMan Low Density Arrays followed by individual quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were used to test the differences in the miRNA expression levels of serum microvesicles among 25 GBM patients and healthy controls paired by age and sex. The detected noncoding RNAs were then validated in another 50 GBM patients. RESULTS: We found that the expression levels of 1 small noncoding RNA (RNU6-1) and 2 microRNAs (miR-320 and miR-574-3p) were significantly associated with a GBM diagnosis. In addition, RNU6-1 was consistently an independent predictor of a GBM diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether our results uncovered a small noncoding RNA signature in microvesicles isolated from GBM patient serum that could be used as a fast and reliable differential diagnostic biomarker.

Stem Cells Dev	2014	Early work on platelet and erythrocyte vesicles interpreted the phenomena as a discard of material from cells. Subsequently, vesicles were studied as possible vaccines and, most recently, there has been a focus on the effects of vesicles on cell fate. Recent studies have indicated that extracellular vesicles, previously referred to as microvesicles or exosomes, have the capacity to change the phenotype of neighboring cells. Extensive work has shown that vesicles derived from either the lung or liver can enter bone marrow cells (this is a prerequisite) and alter their fate toward that of the originating liver and lung tissue. Lung vesicles interacted with bone marrow cells result in the bone marrow cells expressing surfactants A-D, Clara cell protein, and aquaporin-5 mRNA. In a similar vein, liver-derived vesicles induce albumin mRNA in target marrow cells. The vesicles contain protein, mRNA, microRNA, and noncoding RNA and variably some DNA. This genetic package is delivered to cells and alters the phenotype. Further studies have shown that initially the altered phenotype is due to the transfer of mRNA and a transcriptional modulator, but long-term epigenetic changes are induced through transfer of a transcriptional factor, and the mRNA is rapidly degraded in the cell. Studies on the capacity of vesicles to restore injured tissue have been quite informative. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived vesicles are able to reverse the injury to the damaged liver and kidney. Other studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cell-derived vesicles can reverse radiation toxicity of bone marrow stem cells. Extracellular vesicles offer an intriguing strategy for treating a number of diseases characterized by tissue injury.	PMC4066231

Mol Cancer	2014	BACKGROUND: Wnt proteins are important for developmental processes and certain diseases. WNT5A is a non-canonical Wnt protein that previously has been shown to play a role in the progression of malignant melanoma. High expression of WNT5A in melanoma tumors correlates to formation of distant metastasis and poor prognosis. This has partly been described by the findings that WNT5A expression in melanoma cell lines increases migration and invasion. METHODS: Malignant melanoma cell lines were treated with rWNT5A or WNT5A siRNA, and mRNA versus protein levels of soluble mediators were measured using RT-PCR, cytokine bead array and ELISA. The induced signaling pathways were analyzed using inhibitors, Rho-GTPase pull down assays and western blot. Ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy was used to analyze microvesicles. Gene expression microarray data obtained from primary malignant melanomas was used to verify our data. RESULTS: We show that WNT5A signaling induces a Ca2+-dependent release of exosomes containing the immunomodulatory and pro-angiogenic proteins IL-6, VEGF and MMP2 in melanoma cells. The process was independent of the transcriptional machinery and depletion of WNT5A reduced the levels of the exosome-derived proteins. The WNT5A induced exosomal secretion was neither affected by Tetanus toxin nor Brefeldin A, but was blocked by the calcium chelator Bapta, inhibited by a dominant negative version of the small Rho-GTPase Cdc42 and was accompanied by cytoskeletal reorganization. Co-cultures of melanoma/endothelial cells showed that depletion of WNT5A in melanoma cells decreased endothelial cell branching, while stimulation of endothelial cells with isolated rWNT5A-induced melanoma exosomes increased endothelial cell branching in vitro. Finally, gene expression data analysis of primary malignant melanomas revealed a correlation between WNT5A expression and the angiogenesis marker ESAM. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that WNT5A has a broader function on tumor progression and metastatic spread than previously known; by inducing exosome-release of immunomodulatory and pro-angiogenic factors that enhance the immunosuppressive and angiogenic capacity of the tumors thus rendering them more aggressive and more prone to metastasize.

Programmed cell death 4 and microRNA 21 inverse expression is maintained in cells and exosomes from ovarian serous carcinoma effusions.	Cancer Cytopathol	2014	BACKGROUND: Ovarian serous carcinoma (OSC) is a fatal gynecologic malignancy usually presenting with bilateral localization and malignant peritoneal effusion. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is a tumor suppressor gene whose expression is directly controlled by microRNA-21 (miR-21). Exosomes are small cell-derived vesicles that participate in intercellular communication, delivering their cargo of molecules to specific cells. Exosomes are involved in several physiological and pathological processes including oncogenesis, immunomodulation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The current study analyzed the expression of PDCD4 and miR-21 in resected OSC specimens and in cells and exosomes from OSC peritoneal effusions. METHODS: PDCD4 was immunohistochemically examined in 14 normal ovaries, 14 serous cystadenoma (CA), and 14 OSC cases. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of PDCD4 and miR-21 expression was performed in CA and OSC cases and in cells and exosomes obtained from 10 OSC and 10 nonneoplastic peritoneal effusions. miR-21 was also evaluated by in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a gradual PDCD4 loss from normal ovaries to CA and OSC specimens. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction displayed higher PDCD4 messenger RNA levels in CA specimens compared with OSC cases and highlighted miR-21 overexpression in OSC specimens. In situ hybridization detected miR-21 only in OSC cells. This PDCD4 and miR-21 inverse expression was also noted in cells and exosomes from OSC peritoneal effusions compared with nonneoplastic effusions. CONCLUSIONS: PDCD4 and miR-21 are involved in OSC oncogenesis. The transfer of miR-21 by exosomes could promote oncogenic transformation in target cells distant from the primary tumor without direct colonization by cancer cells and could be used as a diagnostic tool.

Electronic address: .	jjg5b@virginia.edu		Exosomal transfer from human renal proximal tubule cells to distal tubule and collecting duct cells.	Clin Biochem	2014	OBJECTIVES: Exosomes are 50-90nm extracellular membrane particles that may mediate trans-cellular communication between cells and tissues. We have reported that human urinary exosomes contain miRNA that are biomarkers for salt sensitivity and inverse salt sensitivity of blood pressure. This study examines exosomal transfer between cultured human renal proximal tubule cells (RPTCs) and from RPTCs to human distal tubule and collecting duct cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: For RPTC-to-RPTC exosomal transfer, we utilized 5 RPTC lines producing exosomes that were fluorescently labeled with exosomal-specific markers CD63-EGFP or CD9-RFP. Transfer between RPTCs was demonstrated by co-culturing CD63-EGFP and CD9-RFP stable clones and performing live confocal microscopy. For RPTC-to-distal segment exosomal transfer, we utilized 5 distal tubule and 3 collecting duct immortalized cell lines. RESULTS: Time-lapse videos revealed unique proximal tubule cellular uptake patterns for exosomes and eventual accumulation into the multivesicular body. Using culture supernatant containing exosomes from 3 CD9-RFP and 2 CD63-EGFP RPTC cell lines, all 5 distal tubule cell lines and all 3 collecting duct cell lines showed exosomal uptake as measured by microplate fluorometry. Furthermore, we found that RPTCs stimulated with fenoldopam (dopamine receptor agonist) had increased production of exosomes, which upon transfer to distal tubule and collecting duct cells, reduced the basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) production rates in those recipient cells. CONCLUSION: Due to the complex diversity of exosomal contents, this proximal-to-distal vesicular inter-nephron transfer may represent a previously unrecognized trans-renal communication system.

Potential application of extracellular vesicles of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells in Alzheimer's disease therapeutics.	Methods Mol Biol	2015	In the last 20 years, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have attracted attention as a versatile cell-cell communication mediator. The biological significance of EVs remains to be fully elucidated, but many reports have suggested that the functions of EVs mirror, at least in part, those of the cells from which they originate. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a type of adult stem cell that can be isolated from connective tissue including bone marrow and adipose tissue and have emerged as an attractive candidate for cell therapy applications. Accordingly, an increasing number of reports have shown that EVs derived from MSCs have therapeutic potential in multiple diseases. We recently reported a novel therapeutic potential of EVs secreted from human adipose tissue-derived MSCs (hADSCs) (also known as adipose tissue-derived stem cells; ASCs) against Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that hADSCs secrete exosomes carrying enzymatically active neprilysin, the most important β-amyloid peptide (Aβ)-degrading enzyme in the brain. In this chapter, we describe a method by which to evaluate the therapeutic potential of hADSC-derived EVs against AD from the point of view of their Aβ-degrading capacity.

Cell Mol Life Sci	2015	Cell-to-cell transfer of prions is a crucial step in the spreading of prion infection through infected tissue. At the cellular level, several distinct pathways including direct cell-cell contacts and release of various types of infectious extracellular vesicles have been described that may potentially lead to infection of naïve cells. The relative contribution of these pathways and whether they may vary depending on the prion strain and/or on the infected cell type are not yet known. In this study we used a single cell type (RK13) infected with three different prion strains. We showed that in each case, most of the extracellular prions resulted from active cell secretion through the exosomal pathway. Further, quantitative analysis of secreted infectivity indicated that the proportion of prions eventually secreted was dramatically dependent on the prion strain. Our data also highlight that infectious exosomes secreted from cultured cells might represent a biologically pertinent material for spiking experiments. Also discussed is the appealing possibility that abnormal PrP from different prion strains may differentially interact with the cellular machinery to promote secretion.

Clin Cancer Res	2015	PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer frequently causes diabetes. We recently proposed adrenomedullin as a candidate mediator of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in pancreatic cancer. How pancreatic cancer-derived adrenomedullin reaches β cells remote from the cancer to induce β-cell dysfunction is unknown. We tested a novel hypothesis that pancreatic cancer sheds adrenomedullin-containing exosomes into circulation, which are transported to β cells and impair insulin secretion. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS: We characterized exosomes from conditioned media of pancreatic cancer cell lines (n = 5) and portal/peripheral venous blood of patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 20). Western blot analysis showed the presence of adrenomedullin in pancreatic cancer-exosomes. We determined the effect of adrenomedullin-containing pancreatic cancer exosomes on insulin secretion from INS-1 β cells and human islets, and demonstrated the mechanism of exosome internalization into β cells. We studied the interaction between β-cell adrenomedullin receptors and adrenomedullin present in pancreatic cancer-exosomes. In addition, the effect of adrenomedullin on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response genes and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species generation in β cells was shown. RESULTS: Exosomes were found to be the predominant extracellular vesicles secreted by pancreatic cancer into culture media and patient plasma. Pancreatic cancer-exosomes contained adrenomedullin and CA19-9, readily entered β cells through caveolin-mediated endocytosis or macropinocytosis, and inhibited insulin secretion. Adrenomedullin in pancreatic cancer exosomes interacted with its receptor on β cells. Adrenomedullin receptor blockade abrogated the inhibitory effect of exosomes on insulin secretion. β cells exposed to adrenomedullin or pancreatic cancer exosomes showed upregulation of ER stress genes and increased reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic cancer causes paraneoplastic β-cell dysfunction by shedding adrenomedullin(+)/CA19-9(+) exosomes into circulation that inhibit insulin secretion, likely through adrenomedullin-induced ER stress and failure of the unfolded protein response.

Electronic address: .	tom.anchordoquy@ucdenver.edu		Biodistribution and delivery efficiency of unmodified tumor-derived exosomes.	J Control Release	2015	The use of exosomes as a drug delivery vehicle has gained considerable interest. To establish if exosomes could be utilized effectively for drug delivery, a better understanding of their in vivo fate must be established. Through comparisons to liposomal formulations, which have been studied extensively for the last thirty years, we were able to make some comprehensive conclusions about the fate of unmodified tumor-derived exosomes in vivo. We observed a comparable rapid clearance and minimal tumor accumulation of intravenously-injected exosomes, PC:Chol liposomes, and liposomes formulated with the lipid extract of exosomes, suggesting that the unique protein and lipid composition of exosomes does not appreciably impact exosomes' rate of clearance and biodistribution. This rapid clearance along with minimal tumor accumulation of unmodified exosomes limits their use as an anti-cancer drug delivery vehicle; however, when delivered intratumorally, exosomes remained associated with tumor tissue to a significantly greater extent than PC:Chol liposomes. Furthermore, experiments utilizing mice with impaired adaptive or innate immune systems, revealed the significance of the innate immune system along with the complement protein C5 on exosomes' rate of clearance.

Cell Commun Signal	2015	BACKGROUND: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which leukemic cells display a reciprocal t(9:22) chromosomal translocation that results in the formation of the chimeric BCR-ABL oncoprotein, with a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Consequently, BCR-ABL causes increased proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and altered adhesion of leukemic blasts to the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. It has been well documented that cancer cells can generate their own signals in order to sustain their growth and survival, and recent studies have revealed the role of cancer-derived exosomes in activating signal transduction pathways involved in cancer cell proliferation. Exosomes are small vesicles of 40-100 nm in diameter that are initially formed within the endosomal compartment, and are secreted when a multivesicular body (MVB) fuses with the plasma membrane. These vesicles are released by many cell types including cancer cells, and are considered messengers in intercellular communication. We have previously shown that CML cells released exosomes able to affect the tumor microenvironment. RESULTS: CML cells, exposed up to one week, to exosomes showed a dose-dependent increased proliferation compared with controls. Moreover, exosome treatment promotes the formation of LAMA84 colonies in methylcellulose. In a CML xenograft model, treatment of mice with exosomes caused a greater increase in tumor size compared with controls (PBS-treated mice). Real time PCR and Western Blot analysis showed, in both in vitro and in vivo samples, an increase in mRNA and protein levels of anti-apoptotic molecules, such as BCL-w, BCL-xl, and survivin, and a reduction of the pro-apoptotic molecules BAD, BAX and PUMA. We also found that TGF- β1 was enriched in CML-exosomes. Our investigations showed that exosome-stimulated proliferation of leukemia cells, as well as the exosome-mediated activation of an anti-apoptotic phenotype, can be inhibited by blocking TGF-β1 signaling. CONCLUSIONS: CML-derived exosomes promote, through an autocrine mechanism, the proliferation and survival of tumor cells, both in vitro and in vivo, by activating anti-apoptotic pathways. We propose that this mechanism is activated by a ligand-receptor interaction between TGF-β1, found in CML-derived exosomes, and the TGF- β1 receptor in CML cells.	PMC4320527

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	Flow cytometry is a powerful method, which is widely used for high-throughput quantitative and qualitative analysis of cells. However, its straightforward applicability for extracellular vesicles (EVs) and mainly exosomes is hampered by several challenges, reflecting mostly the small size of these vesicles (exosomes: ~80-200 nm, microvesicles: ~200-1,000 nm), their polydispersity, and low refractive index. The current best and most widely used protocol for beads-free flow cytometry of exosomes uses ultracentrifugation (UC) coupled with floatation in sucrose gradient for their isolation, labeling with lipophilic dye PKH67 and antibodies, and an optimized version of commercial high-end cytometer for analysis. However, this approach requires an experienced flow cytometer operator capable of manual hardware adjustments and calibration of the cytometer. Here, we provide a novel and fast approach for quantification and characterization of both exosomes and microvesicles isolated from cell culture media as well as from more complex human samples (ascites of ovarian cancer patients) suitable for multiuser labs by using a flow cytometer especially designed for small particles, which can be used without adjustments prior to data acquisition. EVs can be fluorescently labeled with protein-(Carboxyfluoresceinsuccinimidyl ester, CFSE) and/or lipid- (FM) specific dyes, without the necessity of removing the unbound fluorescent dye by UC, which further facilitates and speeds up the characterization of microvesicles and exosomes using flow cytometry. In addition, double labeling with protein- and lipid-specific dyes enables separation of EVs from common contaminants of EV preparations, such as protein aggregates or micelles formed by unbound lipophilic styryl dyes, thus not leading to overestimation of EV numbers. Moreover, our protocol is compatible with antibody labeling using fluorescently conjugated primary antibodies. The presented methodology opens the possibility for routine quantification and characterization of EVs from various sources. Finally, it has the potential to bring a desired level of control into routine experiments and non-specialized labs, thanks to its simple bead-based standardization.	PMC4382613

Caco-2 cells infected with rotavirus release extracellular vesicles that express markers of apoptotic bodies and exosomes.	Cell Stress Chaperones	2015	Previously, we showed that infecting human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) with rotavirus (RV) increases the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) with an immunomodulatory function that, upon concentration at 100,000×g, present buoyant densities on a sucrose gradient of between 1.10 to 1.18 g/ml (characteristic of exosomes) and higher than 1.24 g/ml (proposed for apoptotic bodies). The effect of cellular death induced by RV on the composition of these EV is unknown. Here, we evaluated exosome (CD63, Hsc70, and AChE) and apoptotic body (histone H3) markers in EVs isolated by differential centrifugation (4000×g, 10,000×g, and 100,000×g) or filtration/ultracentrifugation (100,000×g) protocols. When we infected cells in the presence of caspase inhibitors, Hsc70 and AChE diminished in EVs obtained at 100,000×g, but not in EVs obtained at 4000×g or 10,000×g. In addition, caspase inhibitors decreased CD63 and AChE in vesicles with low and high buoyant densities. Without caspase inhibitors, RV infection increased exosome markers in all of the EVs obtained by differential centrifugation. However, CD63 preferentially localized in the 100,000×g fraction and H3 only increased in EVs concentrated at 100,000×g and with high buoyant densities on a sucrose gradient. Thus, RV infection increases the release of EVs that, upon concentration at 100,000×g, are composed by exosomes and apoptotic bodies, which can partially be separated using sucrose gradients.

Electronic address: .	galvarez@fjd.es		Kidney tissue proteomics reveals regucalcin downregulation in response to diabetic nephropathy with reflection in urinary exosomes.	Transl Res	2015	Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus and the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. DN progresses silently and without clinical symptoms at early stages. Current noninvasive available markers as albuminuria account with severe limitations (late response, unpredictable prognosis, and limited sensitivity). Thus, it urges the discovery of novel markers to help in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Tissue proteomics allows zooming-in where pathophysiological changes are taking place. We performed a differential analysis of renal tissue proteome in a rat model of early DN by 2-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Confirmation was performed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Rat urine samples were collected and exosomes were isolated from urine to evaluate if these microvesicles reflect changes directly occurring at tissue level. The protein showing maximum altered expression in rat tissue in response to DN was further analyzed in human kidney tissue and urinary exosomes. Regucalcin protein or senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30) (Swiss-Prot Q03336) was found to be strongly downregulated in DN kidney tissue compared with healthy controls. The same trend was observed in exosomes isolated from urine of control and DN rats. These data were further confirmed in a pilot study with human samples. IHC revealed a significant decrease of regucalcin in human kidney disease tissue vs control kidney tissue, and regucalcin was detected in exosomes isolated from healthy donors' urine but not from kidney disease patients. In conclusion, regucalcin protein expression is reduced in DN kidney tissue and this significant change is reflected in exosomes isolated from urine. Urinary exosomal regucalcin represents a novel tool, which should be explored for early diagnosis and progression monitoring of diabetic kidney disease.

Effects of methotrexate and salazosulfapyridine on protein profiles of exosomes derived from a human synovial sarcoma cell line of SW982.	Proteomics Clin Appl	2016	PURPOSE: To elucidate effects of salazosulfapyridine (SASP) and methotrexate (MTX), major anti-rheumatic drugs, on exosomes derived from SW982 of a human synovial sarcoma cell line. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: SW982 was treated with SASP and/or MTX under interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-treated or nontreated conditions. Exosomes were isolated from the culture media, and exosomal proteome was analyzed by 2D-DIGE. Protein spots whose intensity was significantly altered by the above treatments were identified by MS. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-four protein spots were detected in the exosome preparations by 2D-DIGE. Compared to the nontreated cells, SASP-, MTX-, and (SASP + MTX)-treated cells displayed 8, 10, and 21 exosomal protein spots with more than ±2.0-fold intensity differences (p < 0.05), respectively. Similarly, the IL-1β-treated cells displayed 58 exosomal protein spots with more than ±1.5-fold intensity differences (p < 0.05). In about half of the 58 spots, the IL-1β-induced intensity changes were suppressed by simultaneous addition of SASP and/or MTX. Most of the identified proteins were immunity- or anti-oxidation-related proteins. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The SASP and/or MTX treatments altered the protein profiles of exosomes and suppressed the effects of IL-1β on the exosomal proteome. Exosomes may play roles in the actions of these anti-rheumatic drugs.

Gap junctional protein Cx43 is involved in the communication between extracellular vesicles and mammalian cells.	Sci Rep	2015	Intercellular communication is vital to ensure tissue and organism homeostasis and can occur directly, between neighbour cells via gap junctions (GJ), or indirectly, at longer distances, through extracellular vesicles, including exosomes. Exosomes, as intercellular carriers of messenger molecules, mediate the transfer of biological information between donor and acceptor cells. Although the biological effects of exosomes in target cells have been intensively studied, the mechanisms that govern exosomal uptake are not fully understood. Here, we show that Connexin 43 (Cx43), the most widely expressed GJ protein, is present in exosomes in the form of hexameric channels and, more importantly, that exosomal Cx43 is able to modulate the interaction and transfer of information between exosomes and acceptor cells. This study envisions a new paradigm where Cx43-containing channels mediate the release of exosomal content into cells, which constitutes a novel and unanticipated mechanism to modulate intercellular communication.

Tumour Biol	2016	Breast cancer (BCa) is one of the major deadly cancers in women. However, treatment of BCa is still hindered by the acquired-drug resistance. It is increasingly reported that exosomes take part in the development, metastasis, and drug resistance of BCa. However, the specific role of exosomes in drug resistance of BCa is poorly understood. In this study, we investigate whether exosomes transmit drug resistance through delivering miR-222. We established an adriamycin-resistant variant of Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) breast cancer cell line (MCF-7/Adr) from a drug-sensitive variant (MCF-7/S). Exosomes were isolated from cell supernatant by ultracentrifugation. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay and apoptosis assay. Individual miR-222 molecules in BCa cells were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Then, FISH was combined with locked nucleic acid probes and enzyme-labeled fluorescence (LNA-ELF-FISH). Individual miR-222 could be detected as bright photostable fluorescent spots and then the quantity of miR-222 per cell could be counted. Stained exosomes were taken in by the receipt cells. MCF-7/S acquired drug resistance after co-culture with exosomes from MCF-7/Adr (A/exo) but did not after co-culture with exosomes from MCF-7/S (S/exo). The quantity of miR-222 in A/exo-treated MCF-7/S was significantly greater than in S/exo-treated MCF-7/S. MCF-7/S transfected with miR-222 mimics acquired adriamycin resistance while MCF-7/S transfected with miR-222 inhibitors lost resistance. In conclusion, exosomes are effective in transmitting drug resistance and the delivery of miR-222 via exosomes may be a mechanism.

Eur J Pharm Biopharm	2016	Exosomes, which are expected to be delivery systems for biomolecules such as nucleic acids, are collected by several methods. However, the effect of exosome isolation methods on the characteristics of exosomes as drug carriers, such as recovery efficiency after sterile filtration and pharmacokinetics, has not been investigated despite the importance of these characteristics for the development of exosome-based delivery systems. In the present study, exosomes collected from murine melanoma B16-BL6 cells by several methods were compared with respect to dispersibility, recovery rate after filtering, and clearance from the blood circulation in mice. The exosomes were collected by three ultracentrifugation-based methods: simple ultracentrifugation/pelleting (pelleting method), ultracentrifugation with an iodixanol cushion (cushion method), and ultracentrifugation on an iodixanol density gradient (gradient method). The isolation methods had little effect on the particle number of exosomes. In contrast, transmission electron microscopy observation and size distribution measurement using tunable resistive pulse sensing indicated that the exosomes of the gradient method were more dispersed than the others. The exosomes were labeled with Gaussia luciferase and intravenously injected into mice. Clearance of injected exosomes from the blood circulation did not significantly change with isolation methods. When the exosomes were filtered using a 0.2-μm filter, the recovery rate was 82% for the exosomes of the gradient method, whereas it was less than 50% for the others. These results indicate that the exosome isolation method markedly affects the dispersibility and filtration efficiency of the exosomes.

China.			Lung cancer exosomes initiate global long non-coding RNA changes in mesenchymal stem cells.	Int J Oncol	2016	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be attracted to tumor sites and become an important component of the tumor microenvironment, thus contributing to tumor development. Emerging evidence suggests that tumor cells could transfer genetic information into MSCs through the release of exosomes. However, the molecular mechanisms by which tumor exosomes contribute to interactions between MSCs and tumor cells remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that lung tumor cell derived exosomes could inhibit MSCs osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. We then investigated the involvement of long non-coding RNAs, a new class of regulators, in tumor exosome treated MSCs by a comprehensive lncRNA and mRNA profiling. lncRNAs (9.1%) (2775 out of 30586) and 9.3% of protein-coding mRNA (2439 out of 26109) were differentially expressed (fold-change ≥2; P-value ≤0.05) in lung tumor cell exosome treated MSCs. Furthermore, we characterized the differentially expressed lncRNAs through their classes and length distribution and correlated them with differentially expressed mRNA. Noteworthy, GO analysis of biological process showed that upregulated mRNAs were enriched in mRNA metabolic process, while downregulated ones were enriched in detection of mechanical stimulus involved in sensory perception. Pathway analysis indicated that 32 pathways were upregulated while 7 were downregulated in A549 exosome treated MSCs. Here, we are the first to determine genome-wide lncRNA expression patterns in exosome treated MSCs by microarray and the results will bring new insights into the mechanisms underlying interactions between tumor cells exosomes and its environmental component the MSCs.

J Virol	2016	In the oral epithelium, peripheral stores of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are transmitted from infiltrating B cells to epithelial cells. Once the virus is transmitted to epithelial cells, the highly permissive nature of this cell type for lytic replication allows virus amplification and exchange to other hosts. Since the initial transfer of EBV from B cells to epithelial cells requires transitioning of the B-cell to a state that induces virus reactivation, we hypothesized that there might be epithelium-specific signals that allow the infiltrating B cells to sense the appropriate environment to initiate reactivation and begin this exchange process. We previously found that the epithelium-specific miR-200 family of microRNAs promotes EBV lytic replication. Here we show that there are high levels of miR-200 family members in oral and tonsillar epithelia and in saliva. Analysis of cultured oral epithelial cells (OKF6) showed that they actively secrete membrane vesicles (exosomes) that are enriched with miR-200 family members. Coculturing of EBV-positive B cells with OKF6 cells induced viral reactivation. Further, treatment of EBV-positive B cells with OKF6 cell-derived membrane vesicles promoted reactivation. Using a cell system that does not naturally express miR-200 family members, we found that enforced expression of a miR-200 family member produced membrane vesicles that were able to induce the lytic cascade in EBV-positive B cells. We propose that membrane vesicles secreted by oral and tonsillar epithelial cells may serve as a tissue-specific environmental cue that initiates reactivation in B cells, promoting the transfer of virus from peripheral B-cell stores to the oral epithelium to facilitate virus amplification and exchange to other hosts. IMPORTANCE: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an important human pathogen that is causally associated with several lymphomas and carcinomas. The switch from latency to the lytic cycle is critical for successful host infection and for EBV pathogenesis. Although the EBV lytic cycle can be triggered by certain agents in vitro, the mechanisms that signal reactivation in vivo are poorly understood. We previously reported that endogenously expressed miR-200 family members likely play a role in facilitating the lytic tendencies of EBV in epithelial cells. Here we show that membrane vesicles secreted from oral epithelial cells contain miR-200 family members and that they can be transmitted to proximal EBV-positive B cells, where they trigger reactivation. We propose that this intercellular communication pathway may serve as a sensor mechanism for infiltrating B cells to recognize an appropriate environment to initiate reactivation, thereby allowing the exchange of virus to the oral epithelium.

Diabetologia	2016	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The crosstalk between skeletal muscle (SkM) and beta cells plays a role in diabetes aetiology. In this study, we have investigated whether SkM-released exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) can be taken up by pancreatic beta cells and can deliver functional cargoes. METHODS: Mice were fed for 16 weeks with standard chow diet (SCD) or with standard diet enriched with 20% palmitate (HPD) and ELVs were purified from quadriceps muscle. Fluorescent ELVs from HPD or SCD quadriceps were injected i.v. or intramuscularly (i.m.) into mice to determine their biodistributions. Micro (mi)RNA quantification in ELVs was determined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)-based TaqMan low-density arrays. Microarray analyses were performed to determine whether standard diet ELVs (SD-ELVs) and high palmitate diet ELVs (HPD-ELVs) induced specific transcriptional signatures in MIN6B1 cells. RESULTS: In vivo, muscle ELVs were taken up by pancreas, 24 h post-injection. In vitro, both SD-ELVs and HPD-ELVs transferred proteins and miRNAs to MIN6B1 cells and modulated gene expressions whereas only HPD-ELVs induced proliferation of MIN6B1 cells and isolated islets. Bioinformatic analyses suggested that transferred HPD-ELV miRNAs may participate in these effects. To validate this, we demonstrated that miR-16, which is overexpressed in HPD-ELVs, was transferred to MIN6B1 cells and regulated Ptch1, involved in pancreas development. In vivo, islets from HPD mice showed increased size and altered expression of genes involved in development, including Ptch1, suggesting that the effect of palm oil on islet size in vivo was reproduced in vitro by treating beta cells with HPD-ELVs. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that muscle ELVs might have an endocrine effect and could participate in adaptations in beta cell mass during insulin resistance.

Clin Transl Med	2016	Extracellular microvesicles (ExMVs) are part of the cell secretome, and evidence has accumulated for their involvement in several biological processes. Fourteen years ago our team demonstrated for the first time that ExMVs carry functional RNA species and proteins from one cell to another, an observation that opened up the new research field of horizontal transfer of bioactive molecules in cell-to-cell communication. Moreover, the presence of mRNA, noncoding RNA, and miRNA in ExMVs in blood and other biological fluids opened up the possibility of employing ExMVs as new detection markers for pathological processes, and ExMVs became a target for "liquid biopsy" approaches. While ExMV-derived mRNAs may be translated in target cells into appropriate proteins, miRNAs regulate expression of corresponding mRNA species, and both RNA-depended ExMV-mediated mechanisms lead to functional changes in the target cells. Following from this observation, several excellent papers have been published that confirm the existence of the horizontal transfer of RNA. Moreover, in addition to RNA, proteins, bioactive lipids, infectious particles and intact organelles such as mitochondria may follow a similar mechanism. In this review we will summarize the impressive progress in this field-14 years after initial report.	PMC4779088

Nano-zymography Using Laser-Scanning Confocal Microscopy Unmasks Proteolytic Activity of Cell-Derived Microparticles.	Theranostics	2016	Cell-derived microparticles (MPs) are nano-sized vesicles released by activated cells in the extracellular milieu. They act as vectors of biological activity by carrying membrane-anchored and cytoplasmic constituents of the parental cells. Although detection and characterization of cell-derived MPs may be of high diagnostic and prognostic values in a number of human diseases, reliable measurement of their size, number and biological activity still remains challenging using currently available methods. In the present study, we developed a protocol to directly image and functionally characterize MPs using high-resolution laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Once trapped on annexin-V coated micro-wells, we developed several assays using fluorescent reporters to measure their size, detect membrane antigens and evaluate proteolytic activity (nano-zymography). In particular, we demonstrated the applicability and specificity of this method to detect antigens and proteolytic activities of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase and plasmin at the surface of engineered MPs from transfected cell-lines. Furthermore, we were able to identify a subset of tPA-bearing fibrinolytic MPs using plasma samples from a cohort of ischemic stroke patients who received thrombolytic therapy and in an experimental model of thrombin-induced ischemic stroke in mice. Overall, this method is promising for functional characterization of cell-derived MPs.	PMC4805657
27122160	Eric Delpire	Department of Anesthesiology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee .	eric.delpire@vanderbilt.edu		The Ste20 kinases SPAK and OSR1 travel between cells through exosomes.	Am J Physiol Cell Physiol	2016	Proteomics studies have identified Ste20-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress response 1 (OSR1) in exosomes isolated from body fluids such as blood, saliva, and urine. Because proteomics studies likely overestimate the number of exosome proteins, we sought to confirm and extend this observation using traditional biochemical and cell biology methods. We utilized HEK293 cells in culture to verify the packaging of these Ste20 kinases in exosomes. Using a series of centrifugation and filtration steps of conditioned culture medium isolated from HEK293 cells, we isolated nanovesicles in the range of 40-100 nm. We show that these small vesicles express the tetraspanin protein CD63 and lack endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi markers, consistent with these being exosomes. We show by Western blot and immunogold analyses that these exosomes express SPAK, OSR1, and Na-K-Cl cotransporter 1 (NKCC1). We show that exosomes are not only secreted by cells, but also accumulated by adjacent cells. Indeed, exposing cultured cells to exosomes produced by other cells expressing a fluorescently labeled kinase resulted in the kinase finding its way into the cytoplasm of these cells, consistent with the idea of exosomes serving as cell-to-cell communication vessels. Similarly, coculturing cells expressing different fluorescently tagged proteins resulted in the exchange of proteins between cells. In addition, we show that both SPAK and OSR1 kinases entering cells through exosomes are preferentially expressed at the plasma membrane and that the kinases in exosomes are functional and maintain NKCC1 in a phosphorylated state.

J Extracell Vesicles	2016	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular communication through transfer of RNA and protein between cells. Thus, understanding how cargo molecules are loaded and delivered by EVs is of central importance for elucidating the biological roles of EVs and developing EV-based therapeutics. While some motifs modulating the loading of biomolecular cargo into EVs have been elucidated, the general rules governing cargo loading and delivery remain poorly understood. To investigate how general biophysical properties impact loading and delivery of RNA by EVs, we developed a platform for actively loading engineered cargo RNAs into EVs. In our system, the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein was fused to EV-associated proteins, and the cognate MS2 stem loop was engineered into cargo RNAs. Using this Targeted and Modular EV Loading (TAMEL) approach, we identified a configuration that substantially enhanced cargo RNA loading (up to 6-fold) into EVs. When applied to vesicles expressing the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) - gesicles - we observed a 40-fold enrichment in cargo RNA loading. While active loading of mRNA-length (>1.5 kb) cargo molecules was possible, active loading was much more efficient for smaller (~0.5 kb) RNA molecules. We next leveraged the TAMEL platform to elucidate the limiting steps in EV-mediated delivery of mRNA and protein to prostate cancer cells, as a model system. Overall, most cargo was rapidly degraded in recipient cells, despite high EV-loading efficiencies and substantial EV uptake by recipient cells. While gesicles were efficiently internalized via a VSVG-mediated mechanism, most cargo molecules were rapidly degraded. Thus, in this model system, inefficient endosomal fusion or escape likely represents a limiting barrier to EV-mediated transfer. Altogether, the TAMEL platform enabled a comparative analysis elucidating a key opportunity for enhancing EV-mediated delivery to prostate cancer cells, and this technology should be of general utility for investigations and applications of EV-mediated transfer in other systems.

Processing of miR17-92 Cluster in Hepatic Stellate Cells Promotes Hepatic Fibrogenesis During Alcohol-Induced Injury.	Alcohol Clin Exp Res	2016	BACKGROUND: Exposure to alcohol and its metabolites can initiate hepatic injury and fibrogenesis. Fibrosis is mediated through hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, leading to global changes in mRNA and microRNA (miR) expression. miRs are expressed in cells or shuttled to exosomes which can be detected in tissue culture media (TCM) and biological fluids. The mechanisms and function underlying the differential expression and processing of miRs and their downstream effects during hepatic injury remain poorly understood. METHODS: Expression of primary (pri)-miR17-92. and individual members of this cluster, miR17a, 18a, 19a, 20a, 19b, and 92, were examined in primary HSCs and human LX2 cells exposed to alcohol-conditioned media (CM), liver tissue from a rodent model of alcoholic injury, and in exosomes from TCM and plasma of rodent models and patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). miR expression was examined in HSCs transduced with an AAV2 vector carrying GFP-miR19b or GFP-control transgene under the collagen promoter. RESULTS: Profibrotic markers were enhanced in primary HSCs and LX2 cells exposed to alcohol-CM, concomitant with decreased miR19b expression and a significant increase in pri-miR17-92. Increased pri-miR17-92 was confirmed in a rodent model of alcohol-induced liver injury. Individual members of the cluster were inversely proportionate in cells and exosomes. AAV2-mediated miR19b overexpression inhibited miR17-92 and altered expression of individual cluster members in cells and exosomes. Expression of individual miR17-92 cluster members in plasma exosomes isolated from patients with ALD was similar to that seen in a rodent model of alcoholic injury and in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Reintroduction of miR19b inhibits HSC activation and modulates expression of pri-miR17-92 and the inverse expression of individual cluster members in cells and exosomes. Better understanding of miR17-92 processing may provide mechanistic insights into the role of individual miRs and exosomes during hepatic injury, revealing new therapeutic targets.	PMC4930422

Tumor cells derived exosomes contain hTERT mRNA and transform nonmalignant fibroblasts into telomerase positive cells.	Oncotarget	2016	Exosomes are small (30-100nm) vesicles secreted from all cell types serving as inter-cell communicators and affecting biological processes in "recipient" cells upon their uptake. The current study demonstrates for the first time that hTERT mRNA, the transcript of the enzyme telomerase, is shuttled from cancer cells via exosomes into telomerase negative fibroblasts, where it is translated into a fully active enzyme and transforms these cells into telomerase positive, thus creating a novel type of cells; non malignant cells with telomerase activity. All tested telomerase positive cells, including cancer cells and non malignant cells with overexpressed telomerase secreted exosomal hTERT mRNA in accordance with the endogenous levels of their hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity. Similarly exosomes isolated from sera of patients with pancreatic and lung cancer contained hTERT mRNA as well. Telomerase activity induced phenotypic changes in the recipient fibroblasts including increased proliferation, extension of life span and postponement of senescence. In addition, telomerase activity protected the fibroblasts from DNA damage induced by phleomycin and from apoptosis, indicating that also telomerase "extracurricular" activities are manifested in the recipient cells. The shuttle of telomerase from cancer cells into fibroblasts and the induction of these changes may contribute to the alterations of cancer microenvironment and its role in cancer. The described process has an obvious therapeutic potential which will be explored in further studies.	PMC5312303

Phosphoproteome Characterization of Human Colorectal Cancer SW620 Cell-Derived Exosomes and New Phosphosite Discovery for C-HPP.	J Proteome Res	2016	Identification of all phosphorylation forms of known proteins is a major goal of the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP). Recent studies have found that certain phosphoproteins can be encapsulated in exosomes and function as key regulators in tumor microenvironment, but no deep coverage phosphoproteome of human exosomes has been reported to date, which makes the exosome a potential source for the new phosphosite discovery. In this study, we performed highly optimized MS analyses on the exosomal and cellular proteins isolated from human colorectal cancer SW620 cells. With stringent data quality control, 313 phosphoproteins with 1091 phosphosites were confidently identified from the SW620 exosome, from which 202 new phosphosites were detected. Exosomal phosphoproteins were significantly enriched in the 11q12.1-13.5 region of chromosome 11 and had a remarkably high level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (6.4%), which were functionally relevant to ephrin signaling pathway-directed cytoskeleton remodeling. In conclusion, we here report the first high-coverage phosphoproteome of human cell-secreted exosomes, which leads to the identification of new phosphosites for C-HPP. Our findings provide insights into the exosomal phosphoprotein systems that help to understand the signaling language being delivered by exosomes in cell-cell communications. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange consortium with the data set identifier PXD004079, and iProX database (accession number: IPX00076800).

Boar seminal plasma exosomes maintain sperm function by infiltrating into the sperm membrane.	Oncotarget	2016	Seminal plasma ingredients are important for maintenance of sperm viability. This study focuses on the effect of boar seminal plasma exosomes on sperm function during long-term liquid storage. Boar seminal plasma exosomes had typical nano-structure morphology as measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and molecular markers such as AWN, CD9 and CD63 by western blot analysis. The effect on sperm parameters of adding different ratio of boar seminal plasma exosomes to boar sperm preparations was analyzed. Compared to the diluent without exosomes, the diluent with four times or sixteen times exosomes compared to original semen had higher sperm motility, prolonged effective survival time, improved sperm plasma membrane integrity (p < 0.05), increased total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activity and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content. The diluent containing four times concentration of exosomes compared to original semen was determined to inhibit premature capacitation, but not to influence capacitation induced in vitro. Inhibition of premature capacitation is likely related to the concentration of exosomes which had been demonstrated to transfer proteins including AWN and PSP-1 into sperm. In addition, using fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analysis, it was demonstrated that exosomes in diluent were directly binding to the membrane of sperm head which could improve sperm plasma membrane integrity.

J Pharm Sci	2017	Exosomes are cell-derived extracellular vesicles that function as intercellular delivery carriers. Our previous study demonstrated that macrophages in the liver contributed to the rapid clearance of intravenously administered B16BL6-derived exosomes from the systemic circulation in mice. Phosphatidylserine (PS) may be responsible for this clearance because it is exposed on the surface of exosomes and is recognized by macrophages. In this study, the role of PS exposed on the membranes of exosomes in the uptake of B16BL6-derived exosomes by macrophages was investigated. Negatively charged PS- or phosphatidylglycerol-loaded liposomes suppressed the cellular uptake of PKH67-labeled exosomes by macrophages, whereas phosphatidylcholine-containing liposome did not affect uptake. Subsequently, for the in vivo analysis, exosomes were labeled with Gaussia luciferase, a reporter protein, or (3-125I-iodobenzoyl)norbiotinamide using exosome-tropic fusion proteins comprising the exosome-tropic protein lactadherin. The blood clearance of Gaussia luciferase-labeled exosomes after intravenous injection into mice was significantly delayed by the preinjection of PS- or phosphatidylglycerol-containing liposomes. Moreover, the accumulation of (3-125I-iodobenzoyl)norbiotinamide-labeled exosomes in the liver was decreased by the preinjection of PS-containing liposomes. These results indicate that the negative charge of PS in exosomal membranes is involved in the recognition and clearance of intravenously injected exosomes by macrophages.

Biomaterials	2016	For cancer immunotherapy via tumor antigen vaccination in combination with an adjuvant, major challenges include the identification of a particular tumor antigen and efficient delivery of the antigen as well as adjuvant to antigen-presenting cells. In this study, we proposed an efficient exosome-based tumor antigens-adjuvant co-delivery system using genetically engineered tumor cell-derived exosomes containing endogenous tumor antigens and immunostimulatory CpG DNA. Murine melanoma B16BL6 cells were transfected with a plasmid vector encoding a fusion streptavidin (SAV; a protein that binds to biotin with high affinity)-lactadherin (LA; an exosome-tropic protein) protein, yielding genetically engineered SAV-LA-expressing exosomes (SAV-exo). SAV-exo were combined with biotinylated CpG DNA to prepare CpG DNA-modified exosomes (CpG-SAV-exo). Fluorescent microscopic observation revealed the successful modification of exosomes with CpG DNA by SAV-biotin interaction. CpG-SAV-exo showed efficient and simultaneous delivery of exosomes with CpG DNA to murine dendritic DC2.4 cells in culture. Treatment with CpG-SAV-exo effectively activated DC2.4 cells and enhanced tumor antigen presentation capacity. Immunization with CpG-SAV-exo exhibited stronger in vivo antitumor effects in B16BL6 tumor-bearing mice than simple co-administration of exosomes and CpG DNA. Thus, genetically engineered CpG-SAV-exo is an effective exosome-based tumor antigens-adjuvant co-delivery system that will be useful for cancer immunotherapy.

Neutral ceramidase-enriched exosomes prevent palmitic acid-induced insulin resistance in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes.	FEBS Open Bio	2016	Oversupply of free fatty acids such as palmitic acid (PA) from the portal vein may cause liver insulin resistance. Production of reactive oxygen species plays a pivotal role in PA-induced insulin resistance in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. Recently, we found that exosomes secreted from INS-1 cells that were transfected with neutral ceramidase (NCDase) plasmids had raised NCDase activity; these NCDase-enriched exosomes could inhibit PA-induced INS-1 cell apoptosis. Here, we showed that PA reduced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 2 and decreased insulin-stimulated uptake of the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG, confirming that insulin resistance occurred in PA-treated H4IIEC3 cells. Moreover, NCDase-enriched exosomes from INS-1 cells rescued PA-induced H4IIEC3 insulin resistance and blocked PA-induced reactive oxygen species production in which ceramide was involved.	PMC5095145

J Biol Chem	2017	Glioblastomas (GBMs) are malignant brain tumors with a median survival of less than 18 months. Redundancy of signaling pathways represented within GBMs contributes to their therapeutic resistance. Exosomes are extracellular nanovesicles released from cells and present in human biofluids that represent a possible biomarker of tumor signaling state that could aid in personalized treatment. Herein, we demonstrate that mouse GBM cell-derived extracellular nanovesicles resembling exosomes from an H-RasV12 myr-Akt mouse model for GBM are enriched for intracellular signaling cascade proteins (GO: 0007242) and Ras protein signal transduction (GO: 0007265), and contain active Ras. Active Ras isolated from human and mouse GBM extracellular nanovesicles lysates using the Ras-binding domain of Raf also coprecipitates with ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)-associated exosome proteins Vps4a and Alix. Although we initially hypothesized a role for active Ras protein signaling in exosome biogenesis, we found that GTP binding of K-Ras was dispensable for its packaging within extracellular nanovesicles and for the release of Alix. By contrast, farnesylation of K-Ras was required for its packaging within extracellular nanovesicles, yet expressing a K-Ras farnesylation mutant did not decrease the number of nanovesicles or the amount of Alix protein released per cell. Overall, these results emphasize the primary importance of membrane association in packaging of extracellular nanovesicle factors and indicate that screening nanovesicles within human fluids could provide insight into tissue origin and the wiring of signaling proteins at membranes to predict onset and behavior of cancer and other diseases linked to deregulated membrane signaling states.

Int J Mol Med	2016	Vesicular-mediated communication between cells appears critical in many biological processes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from healthy and diseased cells are involved in a network of exchange of biologically active molecules. Since EVs present in biological fluids carry the signature of the cell of origin, they are potential biomarkers for ongoing physiological or pathological processes. Despite the knowledge on EV biology accrued in recent years, techniques of EV purification remain a challenge and all the described methods have some advantages and disadvantages. In the present study, we described a method based on charge precipitation of EVs from biological fluids and from cell supernatants in comparison with the differential ultracentrifugation, which is considered the gold standard for EV purification. The analysis of ζ‑potential revealed that EVs have a negative charge that allows the interaction with a positively charged molecule, such as protamine. Protamine was shown to induce EV precipitation from serum and saliva and from cell culture media without the need for ultracentrifugation. EV resuspension was facilitated when protamine (P) precipitation was performed in the presence of PEG 35,000 Da (P/PEG precipitation). The recovery of precipitated EVs evaluated by NanoSight analysis was more efficient than that obtained by ultracentrifugation. By electron microscopy the size of EVs was similar after both methods were used, and the expression of CD63, CD9 and CD81 exosomal markers in the P/PEG‑precipitated EVs indicated an enrichment in exosomes. The RNA recovery of P/PEG‑precipitated EVs was similar to that of EVs isolated by ultracentrifugation. In addition, P/PEG‑precipitated EVs retained the biological activity in vitro as observed by the induction of wound closure by keratinocytes and of proliferation of tubular epithelial cells. In conclusion, charge-based precipitation of EVs has the merit of simplicity and avoids the requirement of expensive equipments and may be used for the efficient isolation of EVs from small biological samples.

Urinary Exosomes Contain MicroRNAs Capable of Paracrine Modulation of Tubular Transporters in Kidney.	Sci Rep	2017	Exosomes derived from all nephron segments are present in human urine, where their functionality is incompletely understood. Most studies have focused on biomarker discovery rather than exosome function. Through sequencing we identified the miRNA repertoire of urinary exosomes from healthy volunteers; 276 mature miRNAs and 345 pre-miRNAs were identified (43%/7% of reads). Among the most abundant were members of the miR-10, miR-30 and let-7 families. Targets for the identified miRNAs were predicted using five different databases; genes encoding membrane transporters and their regulators were enriched, highlighting the possibility that these miRNAs could modulate key renal tubular functions in a paracrine manner. As proof of concept, cultured renal epithelial cells were exposed to urinary exosomes and cellular exosomal uptake was confirmed; thereafter, reduced levels of the potassium channel ROMK and kinases SGK1 and WNK1 were observed in a human collecting duct cell line, while SPAK was unaltered. In proximal tubular cells, mRNA levels of the amino acid transporter gene SLC38A2 were diminished and reflected in a significant decrement of its encoded protein SNAT2. Protein levels of the kinase SGK1 did not change. Thus we demonstrated a novel potential function for miRNA in urinary exosomes.	PMC5240140

Placenta	2017	Recent studies report that 35% of women are either overweight or obese at reproductive age. The placenta continuously releases exosomes across gestation and their concentration is higher in pregnancy complications. While there is considerable interest in elucidating the role of exosomes during gestation, important questions remain to be answered: i) Does maternal BMI affect the exosomal profile across gestation? and ii) What is the contribution of placenta-derived exosomes to the total number of exosomes present in maternal plasma across gestation? Plasma samples were classified according to the maternal BMI into three groups (n = 15 per group): Lean, overweight, and obese. Total exosomes and specific placenta-derived exosomes were determined by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NanoSight™) using quantum dots coupled with CD63 or PLAP antibodies. The effect of exosomes on cytokine (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α) release from endothelial cells was established by cytokine array analysis (Bioplex-200). The total number of exosomes present in maternal circulation was strongly correlated with maternal BMI. Between ∼12% and ∼25% of circulating exosomes in maternal blood are of placental origin during gestation, and the contribution of placental exosomes to the total exosomal population decreases with higher maternal BMI across gestation. Exosomes increase IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α release from endothelial cells, an effect even higher when exosomes were isolated from obese women compared to lean and overweight. This study established that maternal BMI is a factor that explains a significant component of the variation in the exosomes data. Exosomes may contribute to the maternal systemic inflammation during pregnancy.

Mol Cell Proteomics	2017	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health problem worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that some viruses can manipulate the infection process by packing specific viral and cellular components into exosomes, small nanometer-sized (30-150 nm) vesicles secreted from various cells. However, the impact of HBV replication on the content of exosomes produced by hepatocytes has not been fully delineated. In this work, an HBV-inducible cell line HepAD38 was used to directly compare changes in the protein content of exosomes secreted from HepAD38 cells with or without HBV replication. Exosomes were isolated from supernantants of HepAD38 cells cultured with or without doxycycline (dox) and their purity was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Western immunoblotting assays. Ion-intensity based label-free LC-MS/MS quantitation technologies were applied to analyze protein content of exosomes from HBV replicating cells [referred as HepAD38 (dox-)-exo] and from HBV nonreplicating cells [referred as HepAD38 (dox+)-exo]. A total of 1412 exosomal protein groups were identified, among which the abundance of 35 proteins was significantly changed following HBV replication. Strikingly, 5 subunit proteins from the 26S proteasome complex, including PSMC1, PSMC2, PSMD1, PSMD7 and PSMD14 were consistently enhanced in HepAD38 (dox-)-exo. Bioinformatic analysis of differential exosomal proteins confirmed the significant enrichment of components involved in the proteasomal catabolic process. Proteasome activity assays further suggested that HepAD38 (dox-)-exo had enhanced proteolytic activity compared with HepAD38 (dox+)-exo. Furthermore, human peripheral monocytes incubated with HepAD38 (dox-)-exo induced a significantly lower level of IL-6 secretion compared with IL-6 levels from HepAD38 (dox+)-exo. Irreversible inhibition of proteasomal activity within exosomes restored higher production of IL-6 by monocytes, suggesting that transmission of proteasome subunit proteins by HepAD38 (dox-)-exo might modulate the production of pro-inflammatory molecules in the recipient monocytes. These results revealed the composition and potential function of exosomes produced during HBV replication, thus providing a new perspective on the role of exosomes in HBV-host interaction.	PMC5393393

Obstacles and opportunities in the functional analysis of extracellular vesicle RNA - an ISEV position paper.	J Extracell Vesicles	2017	The release of RNA-containing extracellular vesicles (EV) into the extracellular milieu has been demonstrated in a multitude of different in vitro cell systems and in a variety of body fluids. RNA-containing EV are in the limelight for their capacity to communicate genetically encoded messages to other cells, their suitability as candidate biomarkers for diseases, and their use as therapeutic agents. Although EV-RNA has attracted enormous interest from basic researchers, clinicians, and industry, we currently have limited knowledge on which mechanisms drive and regulate RNA incorporation into EV and on how RNA-encoded messages affect signalling processes in EV-targeted cells. Moreover, EV-RNA research faces various technical challenges, such as standardisation of EV isolation methods, optimisation of methodologies to isolate and characterise minute quantities of RNA found in EV, and development of approaches to demonstrate functional transfer of EV-RNA in vivo. These topics were discussed at the 2015 EV-RNA workshop of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles. This position paper was written by the participants of the workshop not only to give an overview of the current state of knowledge in the field, but also to clarify that our incomplete knowledge - of the nature of EV(-RNA)s and of how to effectively and reliably study them - currently prohibits the implementation of gold standards in EV-RNA research. In addition, this paper creates awareness of possibilities and limitations of currently used strategies to investigate EV-RNA and calls for caution in interpretation of the obtained data.	PMC5345583

Exosomes derived from miR-181-5p-modified adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells prevent liver fibrosis via autophagy activation.	J Cell Mol Med	2017	Proliferating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) respond to liver damage by secreting collagens that form fibrous scar tissue, which can lead to cirrhosis if in appropriately regulated. Advancement of microRNA (miRNA) hepatic therapies has been hampered by difficulties in delivering miRNA to damaged tissue. However, exosomes secreted by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) can be exploited to deliver miRNAs to HSCs. ADSCs were engineered to overexpress miRNA-181-5p (miR-181-5p-ADSCs) to selectively home exosomes to mouse hepatic stellate (HST-T6) cells or a CCl4-induced liver fibrosis murine model and compared with non-targeting control Caenorhabditis elegans miR-67 (cel-miR-67)-ADSCs. In vitro analysis confirmed that the transfer of miR-181-5p from miR-181-5p-ADSCs occurred via secreted exosomal uptake. Exosomes were visualized in HST-T6 cells using cyc3-labelled pre-miRNA-transfected ADSCs with/without the exosomal inhibitor, GW4869. The effects of miRNA-181-5p overexpression on the fibrosis associated STAT3/Bcl-2/Beclin 1 pathway and components of the extracellular matrix were assessed. Exosomes from miR181-5p-ADSCs down-regulated Stat3 and Bcl-2 and activated autophagy in the HST-T6 cells. Furthermore, the up-regulated expression of fibrotic genes in HST-T6 cells induced by TGF-β1 was repressed following the addition of isolated miR181-5p-ADSC exosomes compared with miR-67-ADSCexosomes. Exosome therapy attenuated liver injury and significantly down-regulated collagen I, vimentin, α-SMA and fibronectin in liver, compared with controls. Taken together, the effective anti-fibrotic function of engineered ADSCs is able to selectively transfer miR-181-5p to damaged liver cells and will pave the way for the use of exosome-ADSCs for therapeutic delivery of miRNA targeting liver disease.

FASEB J	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale membrane-derived vesicles that serve as intercellular messengers carrying lipids, proteins, and genetic material. Substantial evidence has shown that cancer-derived EVs, secreted by tumor cells into the blood and other bodily fluids, play a critical role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and affecting the pathogenesis of cancer. Here we demonstrate for the first time that squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) EVs were enriched with the C-terminal fragment of desmoglein 2 (Dsg2), a desmosomal cadherin often overexpressed in malignancies. Overexpression of Dsg2 increased EV release and mitogenic content including epidermal growth factor receptor and c-Src. Inhibiting ectodomain shedding of Dsg2 with the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 resulted in accumulation of full-length Dsg2 in EVs and reduced EV release. When cocultured with Dsg2/green fluorescence protein-expressing SCC cells, green fluorescence protein signal was detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis in the CD90+ fibroblasts. Furthermore, SCC EVs activated Erk1/2 and Akt signaling and enhanced fibroblast cell proliferation. In vivo, Dsg2 was highly up-regulated in the head and neck SCCs, and EVs isolated from sera of patients with SCC were enriched in Dsg2 C-terminal fragment and epidermal growth factor receptor. This study defines a mechanism by which Dsg2 expression in cancer cells can modulate the tumor microenvironment, a step critical for tumor progression.-Overmiller, A. M., Pierluissi, J.

Urinary nanovesicles captured by lectins or antibodies demonstrate variations in size and surface glycosylation profile.	Nanomedicine (Lond)	2017	AIM: The use of carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) to isolate urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) was investigated and the captured subpopulations were characterized. METHODS: Pooled uEVs from multiple healthy donors were exposed to lectin-conjugated or antibody-conjugated beads. Recovered uEVs were evaluated by protein estimation, transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and lectin microarray profiling. RESULTS: uEVs isolated by lectin- and antibody-based affinity capture exhibited distinct variations in size and surface content. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed similar EV diameters to those established by nanoparticle tracking analysis, but total particle counts did not correlate closely with protein-based quantification. Lectin microarray profiling demonstrated capture-dependent differences in surface glycosylation. CONCLUSION: Selective, carbohydrate-mediated EV isolation by lectin affinity approaches may prove immediately useful for research and find eventual use in clinical applications.

Stem Cell Res Ther	2017	BACKGROUND: Pathways directing endogenous stem/progenitor cells to restore normal architecture and function of damaged/diseased lungs remain underexplored. Published data have revealed that alveolar progenitor type II cell (ATIIC)-derived signaling promotes re-epithelialization of injured alveoli, yet the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we aim to define the role of ATIIC-derived exosome miRNA signaling in controlling ATIIC-specific proliferation or differentiation in response to injury. METHODS: Pluripotent stem cell-derived cultures, which contain early lung stem/progenitor populations that can subsequently differentiate into ATIICs, were used as a model for unbiased screening and identification of ATIIC phenotype-specific exosome miRNA signaling, and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived ATIICs (hiPSC-ATIICs) were employed to examine the molecular basis of key exosome miRNA signaling in promoting ATIIC-specific proliferation. QRT-PCR was performed to examine expression pattern of ATIIC-derived key exosome miRNA in an alveolar injury model and in injured human lungs. RESULTS: We show that human ATIIC line (A549)-derived exosome miR-371b-5p promotes ATIIC-specific proliferation, but not differentiation, in differentiating cultures of pluripotent stem cells. Using 3'UTR-driven luciferase reporters, we identified PTEN as a direct target of miR-371b-5p. Transfection of miR-371b-5p mimic into hiPSC-ATIICs leads to significantly decreased expression of endogenous PTEN, which stimulates phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream substrates, GSK3β and FOXOs, promoting cell proliferation. While not expressed in normal ATIIC phenotypes, the exosome miR-371b-5p expression is significantly induced after hiPSC-ATIICs or hATIICs (human primary ATIICs) are subjected to bleomycin-induced injury. To rule out that the ATIIC-derived exosome-miRNAs are merely a cell culture phenomenon, we transplanted hiPSC-ATIICs into bleomycin-challenged lungs of mice, and found that the transplanted hiPSC-ATIICs engraft and express exosome miR-371b-5p, along with additional survival of numerous mouse ATIICs in bleomycin-injured lungs. Consistent with these findings, significant levels of exosome miR-371b-5p were also detected in lavage samples of patients with acute pneumonia, but not in those from patients without pulmonary disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data strongly suggest that ATIIC-derived exosome miR-371b-5p may serve as a niche signaling to augment ATIIC survival/proliferation, promoting re-epithelialization of injured alveoli, and thus provide a promising novel target to develop treatment for currently incurable lung diseases.

Sci Rep	2017	Circulating exosome holds great potentials as biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of human cancers. Previously, we have applied small RNA sequencing to identify aberrantly expressed exosomal miRNAs as candidates for diagnostic markers in colon cancer patients. In this validation cohort, plasma derived exosomal miRNA was isolated from 50 early-stage colon cancer patients and 50 matched healthy volunteers. Real-time qRT-PCR revealed that miR-125a-3p, miR-320c were significantly up-regulated in plasma exosomes of the patients with early stage colon cancer. ROC curve showed that miR-125a-3p abundant level may predict colon cancer with an area of under the curve (AUC) of 68.5%, in comparison to that of CEA at 83.6%. Combination of miR-125a-3P and CEA improved the AUC to 85.5%. In addition, plasma exosome level of miR-125a-3p and miR-320c showed significant correlation with nerve infiltration (P < 0.01), but not with tumor size, infiltration depth, and differentiation degree (P > 0.05). On the contrary, plasma CEA level is correlated with tumor size, infiltration depth, and differentiation degree (P < 0.05, r = 0.3009-0.7270), but not with nerve infiltration (P = 0.744). In conclusion, this follow-up study demonstrated circulating plasma exosomal miR-125a-3p is readily accessible as diagnosis biomarker for early-stage colon cancer. When combined with conventional diagnostic markers, miR-125a-3p can improve the diagnostic power.	PMC5482839

Expansion of BCR/ABL1+ cells requires PAK2 but not PAK1.	Br J Haematol	2017	The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are key nodes in oncogenic signalling pathways controlling growth, survival, and motility of cancer cells. Their activity is increased in many human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. To date, PAK deregulation has mainly been studied in solid tumours, where PAK1 and PAK4 are the main isoforms deregulated. We show that PAK1 and PAK2 are the critical isoforms in a BCR/ABL1+ haematopoietic malignancy. In suspension, leukaemic cells deficient for PAK1 and PAK2 undergo apoptosis, while the loss of either protein is well tolerated. Transfer of medium conditioned by shPAK2- but not shPAK1-expressing leukaemic cells interferes with endothelial cell growth. We found that leukaemic cells produce exosomes containing PAK2. Transfer of isolated exosomes supports endothelial cell proliferation. In parallel, we found that leukaemic cells explicitly require PAK2 to grow towards an extracellular matrix. PAK2-deficient cells fail to form colonies in methylcellulose and to induce lymphomas in vivo. PAK2 might therefore be the critical isoform in leukaemic cells by controlling tumour growth in a dual manner: vascularization via exosome-mediated transfer to endothelial cells and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. This finding suggests that the PAK2 isoform represents a promising target for the treatment of haematological diseases.	PMC5655792

Curcumin primed exosomes reverses LPS-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression in buffalo granulosa cells.	J Cell Biochem	2018	Curcumin possesses anti-inflammatory properties and provides a promising treatment for inflammation. The aim of the study is to establish that buffalo granulosa cells when primed with curcumin (20 μM), release improved cellular contents through exosome that can mitigate granulosa cell dysfunction. Recently, we have shown that buffalo granulosa cells exposed to LPS (1 μg/mL) in serum free culture, transiently increased the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) expression followed by the inhibition of CYP19A1 gene expression and estradiol production. Therefore, LPS-treated granulosa cells were used as a model of inflammation and curcumin primed exosomes were utilized to check their potential for reducing granulosa cell dysfunction. Expression level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and CYP19A1 were detected by real time PCR while estradiol levels were measured by ELISA. Exosomes derived from curcumin-treated cells alleviated LPS mediated inflammation. In conclusion, our study potentiates the use of curcumin primed exosomes in mitigating granulosa cell dysfunction. Results show the therapeutic conservatories of curcumin via primed exosomes.

Methods Mol Biol	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes are endocytically derived nanovesicles expelled from cells that contain molecular information in the form of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Transfer of this information to other cells in local or distant microenvironments facilitates cell-to-cell communication. Importantly, diseased cells release exosomes containing specific cargo that may contribute to pathology and can be harnessed for diagnostic or prognostic use. The broad potential medical utility of exosomes has fueled rapidly expanding research on understanding the composition and functions of exosomes in normal and pathological conditions. Here, we provide a complete workflow for purifying exosome-sized vesicles from biological fluids for in-depth proteomic analyses. Moreover, this polyethylene glycol-based method is efficient, highly adaptable, and compatible with a variety of downstream applications.

Nanoscale	2017	We present a microfluidic device for the capture and release of circulating exosomes from human blood. The exosome-specific dual-patterned immunofiltration (ExoDIF) device is composed of two distinct immuno-patterned layers, and is capable of enhancing the chance of binding between the antibody and exosomes by generating mechanical whirling, thus achieving high-throughput exosome isolation with high specificity. Moreover, follow-up recovery after the immuno-affinity based isolation, via cleavage of a linker, enables further downstream analysis. We verified the performance of the present device using MCF-7 secreted exosomes and found that both the concentration and proportion of exosome-sized vesicles were higher than in the samples obtained from the conventional exosome isolation kit. We then isolated exosomes from the human blood samples with our device to compare the exosome level between cancer patients and healthy donors. Cancer patients show a significantly higher exosome level with higher selectivity when validating the exosome-sized vesicles using both electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. The captured exosomes from cancer patients also express abundant cancer-associated antigens, the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on their surface. Our simple and rapid exosome recovery technique has huge potential to elucidate the function of exosomes in cancer patients and can thus be applied for various exosome-based cancer research studies.

Horizontal transfer of miR-23a from hypoxic tumor cell colonies can induce angiogenesis.	J Cell Physiol	2018	Neo vessel formation by angiogenesis is an important event during many pathological conditions including cancer, where it is indispensable for tumor growth and survival. Although, various pro-angiogenic cytokines and soluble factors, secreted by tumor cells, have been reported to promote angiogenesis, recent studies have shown regulatory role of exosomes, secreted by tumor cells in the process of angiogenesis. These exosomes are capable of carrying nucleic acids, proteins, etc., as their cargo. Under the light of these facts and considering the presence of miRNAs, the non-coding RNAs capable of regulating target gene expression, as one of the major cargos in the exosomes, we investigated, whether exosomes derived from normoxic and hypoxic tumor cell colonies exhibit difference in levels of miR-23∼27∼24 cluster members and if so, to check the significance of their horizontal transfer on the process of angiogenesis. Results of our study showed that exosomes secreted by hypoxic tumor cell colonies possess significantly higher levels of miR23a and can induce angiogenesis. Further, we have shown that exosomes secreted by cells that ectopically over express miR23a is capable of inducing angiogenesis in different angiogenic model systems such as CAM, in ovo Xenograft and HUVEC models systems. Further, mechanistic analysis revealed that miR23a driven regulation of angiogenesis is brought about by down regulation of SIRT1 in the recipient cells. Collectively, the results presented here suggest that exosomal transfer of miR23a from tumor cell colonies can induce the process of angiogenesis by targeting SIRT1 in the recipient endothelial cells.

Nanoscale	2017	Promoted therapeutic angiogenesis is a major objective in the area of regenerative medicine, and sufficient vascularization of artificial tissues or organs is one of the main difficulties for the realization of tissue engineering methods. The identification of new kinds of pro-angiogenic materials will greatly profit developments in regenerative medicine. The use of exosomes for this intention is a considerably new idea developed in recent years. However, several limitations need to be addressed before their use as clinical therapeutics, including the lack of efficient exosome enrichment and methods to endow exosomes with targeting ability. Herein, we pioneered biomimetic particles with topographic structures for exosome isolation. Using this system, nearly 80% of exosomes were isolated in 30 min. Through a donor cell-assisted membrane modification strategy, the isolated exosomes exhibited increased targeting to blood vessels due to the modified Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide on the exosome membrane, and simultaneously possessed a synergistic therapeutic angiogenesis effect and angiogenesis imaging attributed to metabolic labeling by click chemistry both in vitro and in vivo. The engineered exosomes represent a potential new therapeutic tool for angiogenesis therapy and imaging in a bio-friendly manner.

Indirect osteoblast differentiation by liposomal clodronate.	J Cell Mol Med	2018	Bisphosphonates impair function of osteoclasts and prevent bone resorption, the mechanism of which has been studied extensively. However, the possible effects of bisphosphonates on chondroblast differentiation and calcium deposition by osteoblasts have only been demonstrated recently. Moreover, cells from monocytic lineage are capable of stimulating osteoblast proliferation. Hence, susceptibility of osteoblasts to various factors requires further investigation. A primary culture of bone marrow-derived stromal cells was treated with liposomal clodronate (0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/ml) or conditioned medium from liposomal clodronate. Liposomal clodronate (0.25 mg) was injected into mouse femur for in vivo experiments. The effects of liposomal clodronate were examined by alkaline phosphatase staining and/or activity assay, and real-time RT-PCR was used for studying the effect on osteogenic gene expression. Administration of liposomal clodronate to bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell culture enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity and mRNA levels of Runx2 and Dlx5. In addition, conditioned medium from liposomal clodronate also stimulated osteogenic characteristics similar to those of observed in vitro, and the number of exosomes in the conditioned medium was highest when pre-treated with liposomal clodronate. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of RANK proteins in exosomes collected from conditioned medium of liposomal clodronate. Identical observations were obtained in vivo, as liposomal clodronate-injected mouse femur showed increased alkaline phosphatase activity and Runx2 and Dlx5 mRNA expressions, even though the numbers of monocytes and macrophages were reduced. In conclusion, osteoblast differentiation was promoted via soluble RANK-containing exosomes in response to clodronates.	PMC5783836
29130994	Siguo Hao				Enhancement of Anti-Leukemia Immunity by Leukemia-Derived Exosomes Via Downregulation of TGF-β1 Expression.	Cell Physiol Biochem	2017	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Minimal residual leukemia cells (MRLs) are difficult to eradicate through traditional treatment and therefore remain to be a major threat to the long-term survival of leukemia patients. Tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs), which carry tumor associated antigens (TAA), may be a potential cell-free tumor vaccine for the specific eradication of MRLs. However, TEXs are intended to be less immunogenic due to exosomal TGF-β1. To further optimize the efficacy of TEX-based vaccines, we investigated whether exosomes from TGF-β1 silenced leukemia cells (LEXTGF-β1si) had an increased potential to induce a specific antitumor effect compared with non-modified exosomes. METHODS: Exosomal TGF-β1 was downregulated via lentiviral shRNA silencing of TGF-β1 in leukemia cells. The characteristics of LEXTGF-β1si were determined via electron microscopy, western blot analysis, and flow cytometry. The antitumor effect of LEXTGF-β1si was evaluated by detecting the properties of LEXTGF-β1si-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs), CD4+ T-cell proliferation, Th1 cytokine secretion, specific CTL activity, and NK cell function. Moreover, to verify the superiority of LEXTGF-β1si immunization, LEXTGF-β1si was subcutaneously injected into DBA/2 mice: either followed by tumor challenge or tumor bearing. RESULTS: The lentiviral shRNA silencing of TGF-β1 in parental leukemia cells successfully downregulated the TGF-β1 level in leukemia cell derived exosomes (LEX). LEXTGF-β1si was uptaken by DCs and was more potent in promoting DC function by upregulating the surface expression of costimulatory factors and MHC class II molecules, while inducing the secretion of IL-12p70 and TNF-α. Furthermore, immunization with LEXTGF-β1si facilitated CD4+ T-cell proliferation and Th1 cytokine secretion, and stimulated stronger specific cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) response and nature killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity more efficiently compared to non-modified LEX. In mice models, immunization with LEXTGF-β1si resulted in a more potent capability to inhibit tumor growth and to prolong survival, suggesting that LEXTGF-β1si was more effective in both protective and therapeutic antitumor tests than non-modified LEX. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that down-regulation of exosomal TGF-β1 effectively induced potent anti-tumor immunity. Our strategy of optimizing exosome vaccine may have promising potential for leukemia immunotherapy.

Sci Rep	2017	Mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (MSCs) exert chondroprotective effects in preclinical models of osteoarthritis (OA). Most of their therapeutic effects are mediated via soluble mediators, which can be conveyed within extracellular vesicles (EVs). The objective of the study was to compare the respective role of exosomes (Exos) or microvesicles/microparticles (MPs) in OA. MPs and Exos were isolated from bone marrow murine BM-MSCs through differential centrifugation. Effect of MPs or Exos was evaluated on OA-like murine chondrocytes and chondroprotection was quantified by RT-qPCR. In OA-like chondrocytes, BM-MSC-derived MPs and Exos could reinduce the expression of chondrocyte markers (type II collagen, aggrecan) while inhibiting catabolic (MMP-13, ADAMTS5) and inflammatory (iNOS) markers. Exos and MPs were also shown to protect chondrocytes from apoptosis and to inhibit macrophage activation. In vivo, Exos or MPs were injected in the collagenase-induced OA (CIOA) model and histomorphometric analyses of joints were performed by µCT and confocal laser microscopy. BM-MSCs, MPs and Exos equally protected mice from joint damage. In conclusion, MPs and Exos exerted similar chondroprotective and anti-inflammatory function in vitro and protected mice from developing OA in vivo, suggesting that either Exos or MPs reproduced the main therapeutic effect of BM-MSCs.

Electronic address: .	764019522@qq.com		Exosomes derived from imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia cells mediate a horizontal transfer of drug-resistant trait by delivering miR-365.	Exp Cell Res	2018	Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant disorder of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Majority of patients can be effectively treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, but a portion of patients will develop drug resistance. Accumulated evidences have identified exosomes in cancer as promoters of tumor progression. Herein, we found that exosomes derived from imatinib resistant CML cells can be internalized into sensitive CML cells and confer drug-resistance traits. We also demonstrated a significant higher level of miR-365 in exosomes derived from drug-resistant CML cells compared with those from sensitive ones using microarray and qRT-PCR. The imatinib sensitive CML cells transfected with pre-miR-365 displayed lower chemosensitivity and apoptosis rate compared with controls. We further confirmed that exosomal transfer of miR-365 induced drug resistance by inhibiting expression of pro-apoptosis protein in sensitive CML cells. In conclusion, our study reveals that exosomes mediate a horizontal transfer of drug-resistant trait in chronic myeloid leukemia cell by delivering miR-365.

J Am Soc Nephrol	2018	Albuminuria is a key instigator of tubulointerstitial inflammation associated with CKD, but the mechanism through which filtered albumin propagates renal injury remains unclear. In this study, we explored the role in this process of exosome mRNA released from tubular epithelial cells (TECs). Compared with control mice, acute and chronic kidney injury models had more exosomes containing inflammatory cytokine mRNA, particularly the chemokine CCL2, in kidneys and urine. In vitro stimulation of TECs with BSA recapitulated this finding. Notably, the internalization of purified TEC exosomes by cultured macrophages increased if TECs were exposed to BSA. Macrophage internalization of exosomes from BSA-treated TECs led to an enhanced inflammatory response and macrophage migration, but CCL2 silencing in TECs prevented these effects. Using a GFP-CCL2 fusion mRNA construct, we observed direct transfer of CCL2 mRNA from TEC exosomes to macrophages. Mice subjected to tail vein injection of purified BSA-treated TEC exosomes developed tubular injury with renal inflammatory cell infiltration. However, injection of exosomes from BSA-treated CCL2-deficient TECs induced less severe kidney inflammation. Finally, in patients with IgA nephropathy, the increase of proteinuria correlated with augmented urinary excretion of exosomes with exaggerated expression of CCL2 mRNA. Moreover, the level of CCL2 mRNA in urinary exosomes correlated closely with levels of renal interstitial macrophage infiltration in these patients. Our studies demonstrate that the increasing release of exosomes that transfer CCL2 mRNA from TECs to macrophages constitutes a critical mechanism of albumin-induced tubulointerstitial inflammation.

Microb Cell Fact	2018	BACKGROUND: The thorough understanding of the physiological and pathological processes mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) is challenged by purification methods which are cumbersome, not reproducible, or insufficient to yield homogeneous material. Chromatography based on both ion-exchange and immune-capture can represent an effective method to improve EV purification and successive analysis. METHODS: Cell culture supernatant was used as a model sample for assessing the capacity of anion-exchange chromatography to separate distinct EV fractions and to isolate nanobodies by direct panning on whole EVs to recover binders specific for the native conformation of EV-surface epitopes and suitable to develop EV immune-capture reagents. RESULTS: Anion-exchange chromatography of cell culture supernatant separated distinct protein-containing fractions and all of them were positive for CD9, a biomarker associated to some EVs. This suggested the existence of several EV fractions but did not help in separating EVs from other contaminants. We further isolated several nanobodies instrumental for implementing immune-affinity protocols. These were able to immobilize EVs from both cell culture supernatant and biological samples, to be used in ELISA, flow-cytometry, and immune-purification. CONCLUSIONS: Here we report the first successful isolation of anti-EV nanobodies for the use in immunoaffinity-based EV capture by panning a phage library directly on partially purified EVs. This achievement paves the way for the application of direct EV panning for the discovery of novel antibody-vesicle surface biomarker pairs and represents the preliminary requirement for the development of selective immune-capture that, in combination with anion-exchange chromatography, can simplify the systematic stratification of EV sub-populations and their individual characterization.

Annu Rev Immunol	2018	The initiation and maintenance of adaptive immunity require multifaceted modes of communication between different types of immune cells, including direct intercellular contact, secreted soluble signaling molecules, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs can be formed as microvesicles directly pinched off from the plasma membrane or as exosomes secreted by multivesicular endosomes. Membrane receptors guide EVs to specific target cells, allowing directional transfer of specific and complex signaling cues. EVs are released by most, if not all, immune cells. Depending on the type and status of their originating cell, EVs may facilitate the initiation, expansion, maintenance, or silencing of adaptive immune responses. This review focusses on EVs from professional antigen-presenting cells, their demonstrated and speculated roles, and their potential for cancer immunotherapy.

MBio	2018	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes have been implicated in the pathophysiology of infections and cancer. The negative regulatory factor (Nef) encoded by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) plays a critical role in the progression to AIDS and impairs endosomal trafficking. Whether HIV-1 Nef can be loaded into EVs has been the subject of controversy, and nothing is known about the connection between SIV Nef and EVs. We find that both SIV and HIV-1 Nef proteins are present in affinity-purified EVs derived from cultured cells, as well as in EVs from SIV-infected macaques. Nef-positive EVs were functional, i.e., capable of membrane fusion and depositing their content into recipient cells. The EVs were able to transfer Nef into recipient cells. This suggests that Nef readily enters the exosome biogenesis pathway, whereas HIV virions are assembled at the plasma membrane. It suggests a novel mechanism by which lentiviruses can influence uninfected and uninfectable, i.e., CD4-negative, cells.IMPORTANCE Extracellular vesicles (EVs) transfer biologically active materials from one cell to another, either within the adjacent microenvironment or further removed. EVs also package viral RNAs, microRNAs, and proteins, which contributes to the pathophysiology of infection. In this report, we show that both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) incorporate the virus-encoded Nef protein into EVs, including EVs circulating in the blood of SIV-infected macaques and that this presents a novel mechanism of Nef transfer to naive and even otherwise non-infectable cells. Nef is dispensable for viral replication but essential for AIDS progression in vivo Demonstrating that Nef incorporation into EVs is conserved across species implicates EVs as novel mediators of the pathophysiology of HIV. It could help explain the biological effects that HIV has on CD4-negative cells and EVs could become biomarkers of disease progression.	PMC5801467

J Immunol	2018	Circulating exosomes containing donor HLA and lung-associated self-antigens (SAg) are thought to play an important role in allograft rejection after human lung transplantation. We characterized exosomes isolated from serum of 10 lung transplant recipients (LTxR) diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and compared them with exosomes isolated from serum of 10 stable LTxR. Lung-associated SAg (K-α-1-tubulin [Kα1T] and collagen V [Col-V]), MHC class II molecules, costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86, and transcription factors class II MHC trans-activator, NF-κB, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α, IL-1R-associated kinase 1, MyD88, and 20S proteasome were detected in exosomes from BOS, but not stable LTxR. In contrast, adhesion molecules were present in both groups. C57BL/6 mice immunized with exosomes from BOS but not stable LTxR demonstrated Ab to SAg (Col-V, 33.5 ± 15.7 versus 10.4 ± 6.4, p = 0.021; Kα1T, 925 ± 403 versus 317 ± 285, p = 0.044) and HLA (mean fluorescence intensity: BOS, 8450; stable, 632; p < 0.05). Furthermore, splenic lymphocytes demonstrated increased frequency of lung SAg-specific IL-17 (Col-V, 128 ± 46 versus 31 ± 21, p = 0.013; Kα1T, 194 ± 47 versus 67 ± 43, p = 0.014) and IFN-γ (Col-V, 165 ± 79 versus 38 ± 40, p = 0.042; Kα1T, 232 ± 64 versus 118 ± 39, p = 0.012). Reduced levels of IL-10-producing cells were seen in BOS exosome immunized mice compared with mice immunized with stable exosomes (Col-V, 59 ± 23 versus 211 ± 85, p = 0.016; Kα1T, 78 ± 49 versus 295 ± 104, p = 0.017). Owing to the unique immune-stimulating properties of exosomes induced during rejection, we propose that they play an important role in eliciting both alloantigen- and SAg-specific immunity, leading to chronic rejection after lung transplantation.

Mol Cell Proteomics	2018	High grade gliomas are the most common brain tumors in adult. These tumors are characterized by a high infiltration in microglial cells and macrophages. The immunosuppressive tumor environment is known to orient immune cells towards a pro-tumoral and anti-inflammatory phenotype. Therefore, the current challenge for cancer therapy is to find a way to reorient macrophages toward an anti-tumoral phenotype. Previously, we demonstrated that macrophages secreted anti-tumoral factors when they were invalidated for the proprotein converstase 1/3 (PC1/3) and treated with LPS. However, achieving an activation of macrophages via LPS/TLR4/Myd88-dependent pathway appears yet unfeasible in cancer patients. On the contrary, the antitumor drug Paclitaxel is also known to activate the TLR4 MyD88-dependent signalling pathway and mimics LPS action. Therefore, we evaluated if PC1/3 knock-down (KD) macrophages could be activated by Paclitaxel and efficient against glioma. We report here that such a treatment of PC1/3 KD macrophages drove to the overexpression of proteins mainly involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement. In support of this finding, we found that these cells exhibited a Ca2+ increase after Paclitaxel treatment. This is indicative of a possible depolymerization of microtubules and may therefore reflect an activation of inflammatory pathways in macrophages. In such a way, we found that PC1/3 KD macrophages displayed a repression of the anti-inflammatory pathway STAT3 and secreted more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Extracellular vesicles isolated from these PC1/3 KD cells inhibited glioma growth. Finally, the supernatant collected from the co-culture between glioma cells and PC1/3 KD macrophages contained more anti-tumoral factors. These findings unravel the potential value of a new therapeutic strategy combining Paclitaxel and PC1/3 inhibition to switch macrophages toward an anti-tumoral immunophenotype.

Emerging Role of Extracellular Vesicles in Bone Remodeling.	J Dent Res	2018	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), as nanometer-scale particles, include exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. EVs are released by most cell types, such as bone marrow stem cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and immune cells. In bone-remodeling microenvironments, EVs deliver specific proteins (e.g., tenascin C and Sema4D), microRNAs (e.g., miR-214-3p, miR-183-5p, and miR-196a), and other growth factors (e.g., bone morphogenetic protein 1 to 7 and transforming growth factor β1) to osteoblasts and regulate bone formation. In addition, EVs can deliver cytokines, such as RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB) and RANKL (RANK ligand), and microRNAs, such as miR-218 and miR-148a, to modulate osteoclast differentiation during bone resorption. EVs also transfer bioactive molecules and have targeted therapies in bone-related diseases. Moreover, bioactive molecules in EVs are biomarkers in bone-related diseases. We highlight the emerging role of EVs in bone remodeling during physiologic and pathologic conditions and summarize the role of EVs in tooth development and regeneration. At the end of this review, we discuss the challenges of EV application in the treatment of bone diseases.

Diagnosis of Hyperacute and Acute Ischaemic Stroke: The Potential Utility of Exosomal MicroRNA-21-5p and MicroRNA-30a-5p.	Cerebrovasc Dis	2018	BACKGROUND: Early and accurate diagnosis of ischaemic stroke (IS) requires the use of an optimized biomarker. Exosomal microRNAs have the potential to serve as biomarkers owing to their stability and specificity. We investigated the expression levels of plasma-derived exosomal microRNA-21-5p and microRNA-30a-5p in the different phases of IS. METHODS: One hundred forty-three patients with IS and 24 non-stroke controls were enrolled. The patients were divided into the following 5 groups: 1 group for the hyperacute phase IS (HIS, within 6 h); two for the acute phase IS (AIS, including days 1-3 and days 4-7); one for the subacute phase IS (SIS, days 8-14); and one for the recovery phase IS (RIS, days >14). Plasma exosomes were isolated using a QIAGEN exoRNeasy kit and examined by transmission electron -microscopy, nanoparticle tracking, and flow cytometry. The expression levels of miRNA-21-5p and miRNA-30a-5p were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The plasma exosomal miR-21-5p levels in SIS and RIS were significantly higher than that in controls (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 respectively). The levels of miR-30a-5p in HIS were significantly higher (p < 0.05) and in AIS (days 1-3) were lower than that in controls (p < 0.05). In AIS (days 1-3), both miRNAs were decreased compared with the HIS group (p = 0.053 and 0.001, respectively). The area under the curve (AUC) of the miR-21-5p was 0.714 for SIS (95% CI 0.570-0.859, p = 0.007), 0.734 for RIS (95% CI 0.596-0.871, p = 0.003); the AUC of the miR-30a-5p was 0.826 for HIS (95% CI 0.665-0.988, p = 0.001), 0.438 for AIS (days 1-3; 95% CI 0.240-0.635, p = 0.516). CONCLUSIONS: The plasma-derived exosomal miR-21-5p and miRNA-30a-5p in combination are promising biomarkers for diagnosing IS and distinguishing among HIS, SIS, and RIS, especially miRNA-30a-5p for the diagnosis of the HIS phase. Our results provide a new reference for clinicians to apply in early-stage diagnosis and identifies the possible value of biomarkers for IS thrombolysis therapy.	
29676587	Nicholas W Morrell	University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ; .	nwm23@cam.ac.uk		A Potential Role for Exosomal TCTP Export in Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.	Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol	2018	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by increased proliferation and resistance to apoptosis of pulmonary vascular cells. Increased expression of translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), a pro-survival and anti-apoptotic mediator, has recently been demonstrated in patients with hereditary PAH (HPAH) although its role in the pathobiology of PAH remains unclear. Silencing of TCTP in blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) isolated from control subjects led to significant changes in morphology, cytoskeletal organization, increased apoptosis and decreased directionality during migration. As TCTP is also localized in extracellular vesicles (EVs), we isolated BOEC-derived EVs (exosomes and microparticles) by sequential ultracentrifugation. BOECs isolated from patients harboring BMPR2 mutations released more exosomes than controls in pro-apoptotic conditions. Furthermore, TCTP protein expression was significantly higher in exosomes compared to microparticles, indicating that TCTP is mainly exported via exosomes. Co-culture assays demonstrated that exosomes transferred TCTP from endothelial cells (ECs) to pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) suggesting a role for endothelial-derived TCTP in conferring proliferation and apoptotic resistance. In an experimental model of PAH, rats treated with monocrotaline demonstrated increased concentrations of TCTP in the lung and plasma. Consistent with this finding, we observed increased circulating TCTP levels in patients with IPAH compared with controls. Therefore, our data suggests an important role for TCTP in regulating the critical vascular cell phenotypes implicated in the pathobiology of PAH. In addition, this research implicates TCTP as a potential biomarker for the onset and development of PAH.	
29722258	Kara Stewart				Diet Impacts Pre-implantation Histotroph Proteomes in Beef Cattle.	J Proteome Res	2018	In ruminants, the period from fertilization to implantation is relatively prolonged, and the survival of embryos depends on uterine secretions known as histotroph. Our objective was to determine if the pre-breeding diet affected histotroph proteomes in beef cattle. Cows were assigned to one of four diets: a control diet (CON), a high-protein diet (PROT), a high-fat diet (OIL), or a high-protein and high-fat diet (PROT + OIL). After 185 days on these diets, an intravaginal progesterone implant (CIDR) was inserted for 7 days. At 9 days after CIDR removal, animals with a corpus luteum were selected ( n = 16; 4 per treatment). Proteins were isolated from the histotroph collected by uterine lavage and analyzed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Over 2000 proteins were expressed ( n ≥ 3 cows per treatment), with 1239 proteins being common among all of the groups. There were 20, 37, 85, and 123 proteins unique to CON, PROT + OIL, PROT, and OIL, respectively. Relative to CON, 23, 14, and 51 proteins were differentially expressed in PROT + OIL, PROT, and OIL, respectively. Functional analysis found that 53% of histotroph proteins were categorized as extracellular exosome, 3.28% as cell-cell adhesion, and 17.4% in KEGG metabolic pathways. Differences in proteomes among treatments support the idea that pre-breeding diet affects histotroph. Understanding the impact of diet on histotroph proteins may help improve conception rates.	
29771531	Huiping Liu				Exosomes as a Drug Delivery System in Cancer Therapy: Potential and Challenges.	Mol Pharm	2018	Exosomes play a pivotal role in mediating intercellular communications and package delivery. They have recently been discovered to serve as diagnostic biomarkers as well as a possible drug delivery vehicle based on their nanometer size range and capability to transfer biological materials to recipient cells. Their unique biocompatibility, high stability, preferred tumor homing, and adjustable targeting efficiency can make exosomes an attractive and potentially effective tool of drug delivery in cancer therapy. While exosomes possess properties that make them uniquely suitable for delivery of bioactive molecules, there remains a to-be-filled gap between the current understanding about exosome biology and the ideal application scenarios. In this review, we summarize the characteristics enabling the potential of exosomes for drug delivery as well as the outstanding questions related to exosome composition and function, production and purification, bioengineering and targeting, uptake and biodistribution, efficacy and immune regulation, etc. Advanced technologies are demanded to visualize, characterize and sort heterogeneous exosome populations. We are positive that the deeper and more comprehensive understanding of exosome biology as well as advanced nanotechnology will certainly accelerate its therapeutic applications.

Lancet	2002	BACKGROUND: Exosomes derived from tumours are small vesicles released in vitro by tumour cell lines in culture supernatants. To assess the role of these exosomes in vivo, we examined malignant effusions for their presence. We also investigated whether these exosomes could induce production of tumour-specific T cells when pulsed with dendritic cells. METHODS: We isolated exosomes by ultracentrifugation on sucrose and D(2)O gradients of 11 malignant effusions. We characterised exosomes with Western blot analyses, immunoelectron microscopy, and in-vitro stimulations of autologous T lymphocytes. FINDINGS: Malignant effusions accumulate high numbers of membrane vesicles that have a mean diameter of 80 nm (SD 30). These vesicles have antigen-presenting molecules (MHC class-I heat-shock proteins), tetraspanins (CD81), and tumour antigens (Her2/Neu, Mart1, TRP, gp100). These criteria, including their morphological characteristics, indicate the similarities between these vesicles and exosomes. Exosomes from patients with melanoma deliver Mart1 tumour antigens to dendritic cells derived from monocytes (MD-DCs) for cross presentation to clones of cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific to Mart1. In seven of nine patients with cancer, lymphocytes specific to the tumour could be efficiently expanded from peripheral blood cells by pulsing autologous MD-DCs with autologous ascitis exosomes. In one patient tested, we successfully expanded a restricted T-cell repertoire, which could not be recovered carcinomatosis nodules. INTERPRETATION: Exosomes derived from tumours accumulate in ascites from patients with cancer. Ascitis exosomes are a natural and new source of tumour-rejection antigens, opening up new avenues for immunisation against cancers.

Box 1738, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands. 	j.hegmans@erasmusmc.nl		Immunotherapy of murine malignant mesothelioma using tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells.	Am J Respir Crit Care Med	2005	RATIONALE: Exploiting the immunostimulatory capacities of dendritic cells holds great promise for cancer immunotherapy. Currently, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy is evaluated clinically in a number of malignancies, including melanoma and urogenital and lung cancer, showing variable but promising results. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if pulsed dendritic cells induce protective immunity against malignant mesothelioma in a mouse model. METHODS: Malignant mesothelioma was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of the AB1 mesothelioma cell line, leading to death within 28 days. For immunotherapy, dendritic cells were pulsed overnight either with AB1 tumor cell line lysate, AB1-derived exosomes, or ex vivo AB1 tumor lysate, and injected either before (Days -14 and -7) at the day of (Day 0) or after (Days +1 and +8) tumor implantation. MAIN RESULTS: Mice receiving tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells before tumor implantation demonstrated protective antitumor immunity with prolonged survival (> 3 months) and even resisted secondary tumor challenge. Tumor protection was associated with strong tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes or purified CD8+ T lymphocytes transferred tumor protection to unimmunized mice in vivo. When given after tumor implantation in a therapeutic setting, pulsed dendritic cells prevented mesothelioma outgrowth. With higher tumor load and delayed administration after tumor implantation, dendritic cells were no longer effective. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate in this murine model that immunotherapy using pulsed dendritic cells may emerge as a powerful tool to control mesothelioma outgrowth. In the future, immunotherapy using dendritic cells could be used as adjuvant to control local recurrence after multimodality treatment for malignant mesothelioma.

Dendritic cell-derived exosomes containing milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-factor VIII attenuate proinflammatory responses in sepsis.	Shock	2006	In sepsis, several cell types (e.g., lymphocytes) undergo apoptosis and have the potential to harm the host if not cleared by professional phagocytes. Apoptotic cells display "eat me" signals such as phosphatidylserine that can be readily recognized by phagocytes. For full engulfment of these cells, binding to integrin alpha(v)beta(3), mediated by the bridging protein, milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-factor VIII (MFG-E8), is necessary. We hypothesized that, in sepsis, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is impaired due to decreased MFG-E8 expression and that adoptive transfer of exosomes containing MFG-E8 is beneficial. Sepsis was induced in rats by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and MFG-E8 expression assessed by Western blot 20 h later. Dendritic cells were generated from bone marrow cells, and secreted exosomes were collected and injected into CLP animals. Plasma cytokines (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and thymocyte apoptosis (TC-Ao, annexin V) were assessed. The ability of peritoneal macrophages from septic animals to engulf apoptotic cells was determined in an ex vivo phagocytosis assay. A 10-day survival study was conducted. Cecal ligation and puncture reduced MFG-E8 protein levels in the spleen and liver by 48% and 70%, respectively, and increased TC-Ao by 1.6-fold. Injection of MFG-E8-containing exosomes, however, led to a 33% reduced detection of TC-Ao, without directly inhibiting apoptosis. In fact, peritoneal macrophages from exosome-treated rats displayed a 2.8-fold increased ability to phagocytose apoptotic thymocytes. Inhibition of MFG-E8 before injection of exosomes completely abrogated the enhanced phagocytosis. Treatment with bone marrow dendritic cell-derived exosomes also reduced plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 levels and improved survival from 44% to 81%. We conclude that, by providing the indispensable factor MFG-E8 for complete engulfment of apoptotic cells, these exosomes lead to an attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response and overall beneficial effect in sepsis.

Biochim Biophys Acta	2007	An important characteristic of tumors is that they at some point in their development overcome the surveillance of the immune system. Tumors secrete exosomes, multivesicular bodies containing a distinct set of proteins that can fuse with cells of the circulating immune system. Purified exosomes from TS/A breast cancer cells, but not non-exosomal fractions, inhibit (at concentrations of nanograms per ml protein) IL-2-induced natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. The dietary polyphenol, curcumin (diferuloylmethane), partially reverses tumor exosome-mediated inhibition of natural killer cell activation, which is mediated through the impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Exposure of mouse breast tumor cells to curcumin causes a dose-dependent increase in ubiquitinated exosomal proteins compared to those in untreated TS/A breast tumor cells. Furthermore, exosomes isolated from tumor cells pretreated with curcumin have a much attenuated inhibition of IL-2 stimulated NK cell activation. Jak3-mediated activation of Stat5 is required for tumor cytotoxicity of IL-2 stimulated NK cells. TS/A tumor exosomes strongly inhibit activation of Stat5, whereas the tumor exosomes isolated from curcumin-pretreated tumor cells have a lowered potency for inhibition of IL-2 stimulated NK cell cytotoxicity. These data suggest that partial reversal of tumor exosome-mediated inhibition of NK cell tumor cytotoxicity may account for the anti-cancer properties of curcumin.	PMC2577190

Exosomes as a short-range mechanism to spread alloantigen between dendritic cells during T cell allorecognition.	J Immunol	2008	Exosomes are nanovesicles released by different cell types including dendritic cells (DCs). The fact that exosomes express surface MHC-peptide complexes suggests that they could function as Ag-presenting vesicles or as vehicles to spread allogeneic Ags for priming of anti-donor T cells during elicitation of graft rejection or induction/maintenance of transplant tolerance. We demonstrate that circulating exosomes transporting alloantigens are captured by splenic DCs of different lineages. Internalization of host-derived exosomes transporting allopeptides by splenic DCs leads to activation of anti-donor CD4 T cells by the indirect pathway of allorecognition, a phenomenon that requires DC-derived, instead of exosome-derived, MHC class II molecules. By contrast, allogeneic exosomes are unable to stimulate direct-pathway T cells in vivo. We demonstrate in mice that although graft-infiltrating leukocytes release exosomes ex vivo, they do not secrete enough concentrations of exosomes into circulation to stimulate donor-reactive T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. Instead, our findings indicate that migrating DCs (generated in vitro or isolated from allografts), once they home in the spleen, they transfer exosomes expressing the reporter marker GFP to spleen-resident DCs. Our results suggest that exchange of exosomes between DCs in lymphoid organs might constitute a potential mechanism by which passenger leukocytes transfer alloantigens to recipient's APCs and amplify generation of donor-reactive T cells following transplantation.

Proteomic profiling of human plasma exosomes identifies PPARgamma as an exosome-associated protein.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2009	Exosomes are nanovesicles that are released from cells as a mechanism of cell-free intercellular communication. Only a limited number of proteins have been identified from the plasma exosome proteome. Here, we developed a multi-step fractionation scheme incorporating gel exclusion chromatography, rate zonal centrifugation through continuous sucrose gradients, and high-speed centrifugation to purify exosomes from human plasma. Exosome-associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and 66 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS, which included both cellular and extracellular proteins. Furthermore, we identified and characterized peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), a nuclear receptor that regulates adipocyte differentiation and proliferation, as well as immune and inflammatory cell functions, as a novel component of plasma-derived exosomes. Given the important role of exosomes as intercellular messengers, the discovery of PPARgamma as a component of human plasma exosomes identifies a potential new pathway for the paracrine transfer of nuclear receptors.

Gastric cancer exosomes promote tumour cell proliferation through PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK activation.	Dig Liver Dis	2009	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles that are released by normal and neoplastic cells. Previous studies have focused on the interaction between tumour-derived exosomes and the immune system, as a consequence of immune suppression or enhancement. However, the effects of tumour-derived exosomes on tumour cells themselves have not been well studied. AIMS: To investigate the effects of gastric cancer exosomes on tumour cell proliferation and the possible mechanisms. METHODS: By serial centrifugation and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, we isolated and purified the exosomes from gastric cancer SGC7901 cells, then viewed them by electron microscopy. Cell proliferation was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Protein expression was assayed by Western blotting. RESULTS: SGC7901-cell-derived exosomes promoted the proliferation of SGC7901 and BGC823 cells. The increase in proliferation induced by exosomes was accompanied by activation of Akt and extracellular-regulated protein kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase or extracellular-regulated protein kinase inhibitor partially reversed the proliferative effect of exosomes. Moreover, the exosome-induced increase in activity of Akt and extracellular-regulated protein kinase coincided with decreased expression of the Casitas B-lineage lymphoma family of ubiquitin ligases. CONCLUSION: Gastric cancer exosomes promoted tumour cell proliferation, at least in part, by activation of PI3K/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-regulated protein kinase pathways. The decreased expression of Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proteins might have contributed to the activation of Akt and extracellular-regulated protein kinase.

Microfluidic isolation and transcriptome analysis of serum microvesicles.	Lab Chip	2010	Microvesicles (exosomes) shed from both normal and cancerous cells may serve as means of intercellular communication. These microvesicles carry proteins, lipids and nucleic acids derived from the host cell. Their isolation and analysis from blood samples have the potential to provide information about state and progression of malignancy and should prove of great clinical importance as biomarkers for a variety of disease states. However, current protocols for isolation of microvesicles from blood require high-speed centrifugation and filtration, which are cumbersome and time consuming. In order to take full advantage of the potential of microvesicles as biomarkers for clinical applications, faster and simpler methods of isolation will be needed. In this paper, we present an easy and rapid microfluidic immunoaffinity method to isolate microvesicles from small volumes of both serum from blood samples and conditioned medium from cells in culture. RNA of high quality can be extracted from these microvesicles providing a source of information about the genetic status of tumors to serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.

Tumor-derived microvesicles induce, expand and up-regulate biological activities of human regulatory T cells (Treg).	PLoS One	2010	BACKGROUND: Tumor-derived microvesicles (TMV) or exosomes are present in body fluids of patients with cancer and might be involved in tumor progression. The frequency and suppressor functions of peripheral blood CD4(+)CD25(high)FOXP3(+) Treg are higher in patients with cancer than normal controls. The hypothesis is tested that TMV contribute to induction/expansion/and activation of human Treg. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: TMV isolated from supernatants of tumor cells but not normal cells induced the generation and enhanced expansion of human Treg. TMV also mediated conversion of CD4(+)CD25(neg) T cells into CD4(+)CD25(high)FOXP3(+) Treg. Upon co-incubation with TMV, Treg showed an increased FasL, IL-10, TGF-beta1, CTLA-4, granzyme B and perforin expression (p<0.05) and mediated stronger suppression of responder cell (RC) proliferation (p<0.01). Purified Treg were resistant to TMV-mediated apoptosis relative to other T cells. TMV also increased phospho-SMAD2/3 and phospho-STAT3 expression in Treg. Neutralizing Abs specific for TGF-beta1 and/or IL-10 significantly inhibited TMV ability to expand Treg. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests that TMV have immunoregulatory properties. They induce Treg, promote Treg expansion, up-regulate Treg suppressor function and enhance Treg resistance to apoptosis. Interactions of TMV with Treg represent a newly-defined mechanism that might be involved in regulating peripheral tolerance by tumors and in supporting immune evasion of human cancers.	PMC2908536

Exosomes containing glycoprotein 350 released by EBV-transformed B cells selectively target B cells through CD21 and block EBV infection in vitro.	J Immunol	2011	Exosomes are nano-sized membrane vesicles released from a wide variety of cells, formed in endosomes by inward budding of the endosomal limiting membrane. They have immune stimulatory-, inhibitory-, or tolerance-inducing effects, depending on their cellular origin, which is why they are investigated for use in vaccine and immune therapeutic strategies. In this study, we explored whether exosomes of different origins and functions can selectively target different immune cells in human peripheral blood. Flow cytometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and multispectral imaging flow cytometry (ImageStream) revealed that exosomes derived from human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and breast milk preferably associated with monocytes. In contrast, exosomes from an EBV-transformed B cell line (LCL1) preferentially targeted B cells. This was not observed for an EBV(-) B cell line (BJAB). Electron microscopy, size-distribution analysis (NanoSight), and a cord blood transformation assay excluded the presence of virions in our LCL1 exosome preparations. The interaction between LCL1-derived exosomes and peripheral blood B cells could be blocked efficiently by anti-CD21 or anti-gp350, indicating an interaction between CD21 on B cells and the EBV glycoprotein gp350 on exosomes. The targeting of LCL1-derived exosomes through gp350-CD21 interaction strongly inhibited EBV infection in B cells isolated from umbilical cord blood, suggesting a protective role for exosomes in regulating EBV infection. Our finding also suggests that exosome-based vaccines can be engineered for specific B cell targeting by inducing gp350 expression.

Enabling a robust scalable manufacturing process for therapeutic exosomes through oncogenic immortalization of human ESC-derived MSCs.	J Transl Med	2011	BACKGROUND: Exosomes or secreted bi-lipid vesicles from human ESC-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hESC-MSCs) have been shown to reduce myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in animal models. However, as hESC-MSCs are not infinitely expansible, large scale production of these exosomes would require replenishment of hESC-MSC through derivation from hESCs and incur recurring costs for testing and validation of each new batch. Our aim was therefore to investigate if MYC immortalization of hESC-MSC would circumvent this constraint without compromising the production of therapeutically efficacious exosomes. METHODS: The hESC-MSCs were transfected by lentivirus carrying a MYC gene. The transformed cells were analyzed for MYC transgene integration, transcript and protein levels, and surface markers, rate of cell cycling, telomerase activity, karyotype, genome-wide gene expression and differentiation potential. The exosomes were isolated by HPLC fractionation and tested in a mouse model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, and infarct sizes were further assessed by using Evans' blue dye injection and TTC staining. RESULTS: MYC-transformed MSCs largely resembled the parental hESC-MSCs with major differences being reduced plastic adherence, faster growth, failure to senesce, increased MYC protein expression, and loss of in vitro adipogenic potential that technically rendered the transformed cells as non-MSCs. Unexpectedly, exosomes from MYC-transformed MSCs were able to reduce relative infarct size in a mouse model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury indicating that the capacity for producing therapeutic exosomes was preserved. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that MYC transformation is a practical strategy in ensuring an infinite supply of cells for the production of exosomes in the milligram range as either therapeutic agents or delivery vehicles. In addition, the increased proliferative rate by MYC transformation reduces the time for cell production and thereby reduces production costs.	PMC3100248

Exvivo experiments of human ovarian cancer ascites-derived exosomes presented by dendritic cells derived from umbilical cord blood for immunotherapy treatment.	Clin Med Oncol	2008	OBJECTIVES: Exosomes, a type of membrane vesicles, released from tumor cells have been shown to be capable of transferring tumor antigens to dendritic cells and activating specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Recent work has demonstrated the presence of high numbers of exosomes in malignant effusions. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a rich source of hematopoietic stem cells and from which a significant number of dendritic cells can be produced. We hypothesized that the exosomes released from metastatic ovarian carcinoma were able to present tumor specific antigen to dendritic cells derived from unrelated umbilical cord blood, then could stimulate resting T cells to differentiate and induce effective cytotoxicity. STUDY DESIGN: Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation of malignant ascites from ovarian cancer patients (n = 10). Purified exosomes were further characterized by Western blot analyses and immunoelectronic microscopy. Dendritic cells were collected from unrelated umbilical cord blood and cultured in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4 and TNF-α. Resting T cells were mixed with dentritic cells previously primed with exosomes and the cytotoxicity were measured by MTT method. T cells were activated by DCs presented with exosomes. RESULTS: 1) the exosomes isolated from the ascites were membrane vesicles of about 30-90nm in diameter; 2) the exosomes expressed MHC class I molecules, HSP70, HSP90, Her2/Neu, and Mart1; and 3)umbilical cord blood-derived DCs previously exosome-primed stimulated resting T cells to differentiate and produce effective cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that tumor-specific antigens present on exosomes can be presented by DCs derived from unrelated umbilical cord blood to induce tumor specific cytotoxicity and this may represent as a novel immunotherapy for ovarian cancer.

Comparison of ultracentrifugation, density gradient separation, and immunoaffinity capture methods for isolating human colon cancer cell line LIM1863-derived exosomes.	Methods	2012	Exosomes are 40-100nm extracellular vesicles that are released from a multitude of cell types, and perform diverse cellular functions including intercellular communication, antigen presentation, and transfer of oncogenic proteins as well as mRNA and miRNA. Exosomes have been purified from biological fluids and in vitro cell cultures using a variety of strategies and techniques. However, all preparations invariably contain varying proportions of other membranous vesicles that co-purify with exosomes such as shed microvesicles and apoptotic blebs. Using the colorectal cancer cell line LIM1863 as a cell model, in this study we performed a comprehensive evaluation of current methods used for exosome isolation including ultracentrifugation (UC-Exos), OptiPrep™ density-based separation (DG-Exos), and immunoaffinity capture using anti-EpCAM coated magnetic beads (IAC-Exos). Notably, all isolations contained 40-100nm vesicles, and were positive for exosome markers (Alix, TSG101, HSP70) based on electron microscopy and Western blotting. We employed a proteomic approach to profile the protein composition of exosomes, and label-free spectral counting to evaluate the effectiveness of each method. Based on the number of MS/MS spectra identified for exosome markers and proteins associated with their biogenesis, trafficking, and release, we found IAC-Exos to be the most effective method to isolate exosomes. For example, Alix, TSG101, CD9 and CD81 were significantly higher (at least 2-fold) in IAC-Exos, compared to UG-Exos and DG-Exos. Application of immunoaffinity capture has enabled the identification of proteins including the ESCRT-III component VPS32C/CHMP4C, and the SNARE synaptobrevin 2 (VAMP2) in exosomes for the first time. Additionally, several cancer-related proteins were identified in IAC-Exos including various ephrins (EFNB1, EFNB2) and Eph receptors (EPHA2-8, EPHB1-4), and components involved in Wnt (CTNNB1, TNIK) and Ras (CRK, GRB2) signalling.

The myxovirus-resistance protein, MX1, is a component of exosomes secreted by uterine epithelial cells.	Am J Reprod Immunol	2012	PROBLEM: Dairy cattle suffer from high percentages of early embryonic loss, and therefore, it is critical to study the function of the uterus at this time. We hypothesize that the antiviral protein, myxovirus resistance (MX)1, regulates secretion in uterine glandular cells during early pregnancy. METHOD OF STUDY: Uterine epithelial cells were used to study uterine function, in vitro. Sucrose gradients, Western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy were used to isolate and identify exosomes. Immunofluorescence and ceramide inhibitors were used for the characterization of exosomes. RESULTS: Myxovirus resistance1 was associated with exosomes and protected from proteases, indicating it was inside exosomes. MX1 partially colocalized with exosomal protein CD63, and a ceramide inhibitor reduced numbers of MX1-associated exosomes. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to characterize MX1-associated exosomes, and we postulate that MX1 regulates secretion in epithelial cells by playing a role in exosome formation or trafficking.

The phosphorylated sodium chloride cotransporter in urinary exosomes is superior to prostasin as a marker for aldosteronism.	Hypertension	2012	Urinary exosomes are vesicles derived from renal tubular epithelial cells. Exosomes often contain several disease-associated proteins and are thus useful targets for identifying biomarkers of disease. Here, we hypothesized that the phosphorylated (active) form of the sodium chloride cotransporter (pNCC) or prostasin could serve as biomarkers for aldosteronism. We tested this in 2 animal models of aldosteronism (aldosterone infusion or low-sodium diet) and in patients with primary aldosteronism. Urinary exosomes were isolated from 24-hour urine or spot urine using ultracentrifugation. In rats, a normal or a high dose of aldosterone for 2, 3, or 8 days increased pNCC 3-fold in urinary exosomes (P<0.05 for all). A low-sodium diet also increased pNCC in urinary exosomes approximately 1.5-fold after 4 and after 8 days of treatment. The effects of these maneuvers on prostasin in urinary exosomes were less clear, showing a significant 1.5-fold increase only after 2 and 3 days of high-aldosterone infusion. In urinary exosomes of patients with primary aldosteronism, pNCC was 2.6-fold higher (P<0.05) while prostasin was 1.5-fold higher (P=0.07) than in patients with essential hypertension. Urinary exosomal pNCC and, to a lesser extent, prostasin are promising markers for aldosteronism in experimental animals and patients. These markers may be used to assess the biological activity of aldosterone and, potentially, as clinical biomarkers for primary aldosteronism.

Cancer cells induced to express mesenchymal phenotype release exosome-like extracellular vesicles carrying tissue factor.	J Biol Chem	2012	Aggressive epithelial cancer cells frequently adopt mesenchymal characteristics and exhibit aberrant interactions with their surroundings, including the vasculature. Whether the release/uptake of extracellular vesicles (EVs) plays a role during these processes has not been studied. EVs are heterogeneous membrane structures that originate either at the surface (microparticles), or within (exosomes) activated or transformed cells, and are involved in intercellular trafficking of bioactive molecules. Here, we show that epithelial cancer cells (A431, DLD-1) adopt mesenchymal features (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like state) upon activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) coupled with blockade of E-cadherin. This treatment leads to a coordinated loss of EGFR and tissue factor (TF) from the plasma membrane and coincides with a surge in emission of small, exosome-like EVs containing both receptors. TF (but not EGFR) is selectively up-regulated in EVs produced by mesenchymal-like cancer cells and can be transferred to cultured endothelial cells rendering them highly procoagulant. We postulate that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like changes may alter cancer cell interactions with the vascular systems through altered vesiculation and TF shedding.	PMC3527943

To test if marrow stromal cell (MSC) exosomes could be used as a vehicle for delivery of anti-tumor miRNAs, we transfected MSCs with a miR-146b expression plasmid, and harvested exosomes released by the MSCs.

Release of luminal exosomes contributes to TLR4-mediated epithelial antimicrobial defense.	PLoS Pathog	2013	Exosomes are membranous nanovesicles released by most cell types from multi-vesicular endosomes. They are speculated to transfer molecules to neighboring or distant cells and modulate many physiological and pathological procedures. Exosomes released from the gastrointestinal epithelium to the basolateral side have been implicated in antigen presentation. Here, we report that luminal release of exosomes from the biliary and intestinal epithelium is increased following infection by the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum. Release of exosomes involves activation of TLR4/IKK2 signaling through promoting the SNAP23-associated vesicular exocytotic process. Downregulation of let-7 family miRNAs by activation of TLR4 signaling increases SNAP23 expression, coordinating exosome release in response to C. parvum infection. Intriguingly, exosomes carry antimicrobial peptides of epithelial cell origin, including cathelicidin-37 and beta-defensin 2. Activation of TLR4 signaling enhances exosomal shuttle of epithelial antimicrobial peptides. Exposure of C. parvum sporozoites to released exosomes decreases their viability and infectivity both in vitro and ex vivo. Direct binding to the C. parvum sporozoite surface is required for the anti-C. parvum activity of released exosomes. Biliary epithelial cells also increase exosomal release and display exosome-associated anti-C. parvum activity following LPS stimulation. Our data indicate that TLR4 signaling regulates luminal exosome release and shuttling of antimicrobial peptides from the gastrointestinal epithelium, revealing a new arm of mucosal immunity relevant to antimicrobial defense.

Mol Cancer	2013	Exosomes can be viewed as complex "messages" packaged to survive trips to other cells in the local microenvironment and, through body fluids, to distant sites. A large body of evidence indicates a pro-metastatic role for certain types of cancer exosomes. We previously reported that prominin-1 had a pro-metastatic role in melanoma cells and that microvesicles released from metastatic melanoma cells expressed high levels of prominin-1. With the goal to explore the mechanisms that govern proteo-lipidic-microRNA sorting in cancer exosomes and their potential contribution(s) to the metastatic phenotype, we here employed prominin-1-based immunomagnetic separation in combination with filtration and ultracentrifugation to purify prominin-1-expressing exosomes (prom1-exo) from melanoma and colon carcinoma cells. Prom1-exo contained 154 proteins, including all of the 14 proteins most frequently expressed in exosomes, and multiple pro-metastatic proteins, including CD44, MAPK4K, GTP-binding proteins, ADAM10 and Annexin A2. Their lipid composition resembled that of raft microdomains, with a great enrichment in lyso-phosphatidylcholine, lyso-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and sphingomyelin. The abundance of tetraspanins and of tetraspanin-associated proteins, together with the high levels of sphingomyelin, suggests that proteolipidic assemblies, probably tetraspanin webs, might be the essential structural determinant in the release process of prominin-1 of stem and cancer stem cells. Micro-RNA profiling revealed 49 species of micro-RNA present at higher concentrations in prom1-exo than in parental cells, including 20 with cancer-related function. Extensive accumulation of prom1-exo was observed 3 h after their addition to cultures of melanoma and bone marrow-derived stromal cells (MSC). Short-term co-culture of melanoma cells and MSC resulted in heterologous prominin-1 transfer. Exposure of MSC to prom1-exo increased their invasiveness. Our study supports the concept that specific populations of cancer exosomes contain multiple determinants of the metastatic potential of the cells from which they are derived.	PMC3698112

Am J Physiol Renal Physiol	2013	Urinary exosomes are small vesicles secreted into urine from all renal epithelial cell types and known to contain proteins that are involved in renal secretion and reabsorption. Among these proteins, urinary exosomal aquaporin-2 (AQP2) has been suggested to be useful for diagnosis of renal disease. However, the mechanisms underlying the excretion of urinary exosomal AQP2 are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the mechanisms of urinary exosomal AQP2 excretion in vivo, using diuretics including furosemide (FS), an inhibitor of the sodium-potassium-chloride symporter; acetazolamide (ACTZ), an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase; OPC-31260 (OPC), a vasopressin type 2 receptor antagonist; and NaHCO3, a urinary alkalizing agent. Samples of urine from rats were collected for 2 h just after treatment with each diuretic, and urinary exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Urinary exosomal AQP2 excretion was dramatically increased by treatment with FS accompanied by urine acidification or with ACTZ accompanied by urine alkalization. Immunohistochemistry showed that apical localization of AQP2 was clearly evident and the plasma vasopressin level was increased after each treatment. Although treatment with OPC alone had no significant effect, coadministration of OPC completely inhibited the FS-induced and partially reduced the ACTZ-induced responses, respectively. Treatment with NaHCO3 increased the excretion of urinary exosomal AQP2 accompanied by urine alkalization. This increased response was partially inhibited by coadministration of OPC. These data suggest that an increased plasma level of vasopressin promoted the excretion of urinary exosomal AQP2 and that urine alkalinization also increased it independently of vasopressin.

Epigenetic regulation of connective tissue growth factor by MicroRNA-214 delivery in exosomes from mouse or human hepatic stellate cells.	Hepatology	2014	Connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) drives fibrogenesis in hepatic stellate cells (HSC). Here we show that CCN2 up-regulation in fibrotic or steatotic livers, or in culture-activated or ethanol-treated primary mouse HSC, is associated with a reciprocal down-regulation of microRNA-214 (miR-214). By using protector or reporter assays to investigate the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of CCN2 mRNA, we found that induction of CCN2 expression in HSC by fibrosis-inducing stimuli was due to reduced expression of miR-214, which otherwise inhibited CCN2 expression by directly binding to the CCN2 3'-UTR. Additionally, miR-214 was present in HSC exosomes, which were bi-membrane vesicles, 50-150 nm in diameter, negatively charged (-26 mV), and positive for CD9. MiR-214 levels in exosomes but not in cell lysates were reduced by pretreatment of the cells with the exosome inhibitor, GW4869. Coculture of either quiescent HSC or miR-214-transfected activated HSC with CCN2 3'-UTR luciferase reporter-transfected recipient HSC resulted in miR-214- and exosome-dependent regulation of a wild-type CCN2 3'-UTR reporter but not of a mutant CCN2 3'-UTR reporter lacking the miR-214 binding site. Exosomes from HSC were a conduit for uptake of miR-214 by primary mouse hepatocytes. Down-regulation of CCN2 expression by miR-214 also occurred in human LX-2 HSC, consistent with a conserved miR-214 binding site in the human CCN2 3'-UTR. MiR-214 in LX-2 cells was shuttled by way of exosomes to recipient LX-2 cells or human HepG2 hepatocytes, resulting in suppression of CCN2 3'-UTR activity or expression of CCN2 downstream targets, including alpha smooth muscle actin or collagen. Experimental fibrosis in mice was associated with reduced circulating miR-214 levels. CONCLUSION: Exosomal transfer of miR-214 is a paradigm for the regulation of CCN2-dependent fibrogenesis and identifies fibrotic pathways as targets of intercellular regulation by exosomal miRs.

Cell Commun Signal	2013	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles of endocytic origin that are involved in cell-to-cell communication including shuttle RNA, mainly mRNA and microRNA. As exosomes naturally carry RNA between cells, these particles might be useful in gene cancer therapy to deliver therapeutic short interfering RNA (siRNA) to the target cells. Despite the promise of RNA interference (RNAi) for use in therapy, several technical obstacles must be overcome. Exogenous siRNA is prone to degradation, has a limited ability to cross cell membranes and may induce an immune response. Naturally occurring RNA carriers, such as exosomes, might provide an untapped source of effective delivery strategies. RESULTS: This study demonstrates that exosomes can deliver siRNA to recipient cells in vitro. The different strategies were used to introduce siRNAs into human exosomes of various origins. The delivery of fluorescently labeled siRNA via exosomes to cells was confirmed using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Two different siRNAs against RAD51 and RAD52 were used to transfect into the exosomes for therapeutic delivery into target cells. The exosome-delivered siRNAs were effective at causing post-transcriptional gene silencing in recipient cells. Moreover, the exosome-delivered siRNA against RAD51 was functional and caused the massive reproductive cell death of recipient cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results strongly suggest that exosomes effectively delivered the siRNA into the target cells. The therapeutic potential of exosome-mediated siRNA delivery was demonstrated in vitro by the strong knockdown of RAD51, a prospective therapeutic target for cancer cells. The results give an additional evidence of the ability to use human exosomes as vectors in cancer therapy, including RNAi-based gene therapy.	PMC3895799

Enhanced shedding of extracellular vesicles from amoeboid prostate cancer cells: potential effects on the tumor microenvironment.	Cancer Biol Ther	2014	The gene encoding the cytoskeletal regulator DIAPH3 is lost at high frequency in metastatic prostate cancer, and DIAPH3 silencing evokes a transition to an amoeboid tumor phenotype in multiple cell backgrounds. This amoeboid transformation is accompanied by increased tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. DIAPH3 silencing also promotes the formation of atypically large (> 1 μm) membrane blebs that can be shed as extracellular vesicles (EV) containing bioactive cargo. Whether loss of DIAPH3 also stimulates the release of nano-sized EV (e.g., exosomes) is not established. Here we examined the mechanism of release and potential biological functions of EV shed from DIAPH3-silenced and other prostate cancer cells. We observed that stimulation of LNCaP cells with the prostate stroma-derived growth factor heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), combined with p38MAPK inhibition caused EV shedding, a process mediated by ERK1/2 hyperactivation. DIAPH3 silencing in DU145 cells also increased rates of EV production. EV isolated from DIAPH3-silenced cells activated AKT1 and androgen signaling, increased proliferation of recipient tumor cells, and suppressed proliferation of human macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. DU145 EV contained miR-125a, which suppressed AKT1 expression and proliferation in recipient human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages. Our findings suggest that EV produced as a result of DIAPH3 loss or growth factor stimulation may condition the tumor microenvironment through multiple mechanisms, including the proliferation of cancer cells and suppression of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2014	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as potential anticancer agents, but their clinical application is limited by the lack of an effective delivery system to tumors. Exosomes are small vesicles that play important roles in intercellular communication. Here, we show that synthetic miR-143 introduced into cells is released enveloped in exosomes and that the secreted exosome-formed miR-143 is transferred to osteosarcoma cells. The delivery of exosome-formed miR-143 significantly reduced the migration of osteosarcoma cells. The delivery efficiency of exosome-formed miR-143 was less than that achieved with lipofection, but the migratory potential of osteosarcoma cells was similarly inhibited after both strategies. Our results suggest that exosomes can deliver synthetic miR-143 and are a potentially efficient and functional delivery system.

Human CD4+ CD39+ regulatory T cells produce adenosine upon co-expression of surface CD73 or contact with CD73+ exosomes or CD73+ cells.	Clin Exp Immunol	2014	While murine CD4(+) CD39(+) regulatory T cells (T(reg)) co-express CD73 and hydrolyze exogenous (e) adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to immunosuppressive adenosine (ADO), surface co-expression of CD73 on human circulating CD4(+) CD39(+) T(reg) is rare. Therefore, the ability of human T(reg) to produce and utilize ADO for suppression remains unclear. Using mass spectrometry, we measured nucleoside production by subsets of human CD4(+) CD39(+) and CD4(+) CD39(-)CD73(+) T cells or CD19(+) B cells isolated from blood of 30 volunteers and 14 cancer patients. CD39 and CD73 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry, Western blots, confocal microscopy or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Circulating CD4(+) CD39(+) T(reg) which hydrolyzed eATP to 5'-AMP contained few intracytoplasmic granules and had low CD73 mRNA levels. Only ∼1% of these T(reg) were CD39(+) CD73(+) . In contrast, CD4(+) CD39(neg) CD73(+) T cells contained numerous CD73(+) granules in the cytoplasm and strongly expressed surface CD73. In vitro-generated T(reg) (Tr1) and most B cells were CD39(+) CD73(+) . All these CD73(+) T cell subsets and B cells hydrolyzed 5'-AMP to ADO. Exosomes isolated from plasma of normal control (NC) or cancer patients carried enzymatically active CD39 and CD73(+) and, when supplied with eATP, hydrolyzed it to ADO. Only CD4(+) CD39(+) T(reg) co-incubated with CD4(+) CD73(+) T cells, B cells or CD39(+) CD73(+) exosomes produced ADO. Thus, contact with membrane-tethered CD73 was sufficient for ADO production by CD4(+) CD39(+) T(reg). In microenvironments containing CD4(+) CD73(+) T cells, B cells or CD39(+) CD73(+) exosomes, CD73 is readily available to CD4(+) CD39(+) CD73(neg) T(reg) for the production of immunosuppressive ADO.

Study of circulating microRNA-125b levels in serum exosomes in advanced melanoma.	Arch Pathol Lab Med	2014	CONTEXT: Malignant melanoma is an aggressive tumor that produces exosomes, which contain microRNAs (miRNAs) that could be of utility in following tumoral cell dysregulation. MicroR-125b is a miRNA whose down-regulation seems to be implicated in melanoma progression. OBJECTIVE: To analyze miR-125b levels in serum, and in exosomes obtained from serum, from patients with advanced melanoma. DESIGN: Serum samples were obtained from 21 patients with advanced melanoma, from 16 disease-free patients with melanoma, and from 19 healthy volunteers. Exosomes were isolated from serum by precipitation, and miR-16 and miR-125b levels were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: MicroR-16, but not miR-125b, was detected in all samples, and miR-16 levels were significantly higher in serum than they were in exosomes. MicroR-16 expression levels did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (patients with melanoma and healthy donors). There was a significant relationship between miR-125b and miR-16 levels in exosomes. Additionally, miR-125b levels in exosomes were significantly lower in patients with melanoma compared with disease-free patients with melanoma and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes can provide a suitable material to measure circulating miRNA in melanoma, and miR-16 can be used as an endogenous normalizer. Lower levels of miR-125b in exosomes obtained from serum are associated with advanced melanoma disease, probably reflecting the tumoral cell dysregulation.

Electronic address: .	jcaradec@prostatecentre.com		Reproducibility and efficiency of serum-derived exosome extraction methods.	Clin Biochem	2014	OBJECTIVES: Exosomes are emerging as a source of biomarkers with putative prognostic and diagnostic value. However, little is known about the efficiency, reproducibility and reliability of the protocols routinely used to quantify exosomes in the human serum. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used increasing amounts of the same serum sample to isolate exosomes using two different methods: ultracentrifugation onto a sucrose cushion and ExoQuick™. Quantitative analysis of serum-derived exosomes was performed by determining protein concentration (BCA assay) and the number of nanoparticles (Nanosight™ technology). Exosome quality was assessed by Coomassie staining and Western blotting for CD9, LAMP2 exosomal markers and a negative marker Grp94. RESULTS: Correlation between serum volume and the number of isolated exosomes is significant for both methods when exosomes are quantified using protein concentration. However, when the number of nanoparticles is used to quantify exosomes, ExoQuick™ is the only reproducible and efficient method. CD9, LAMP2 and Grp94 exosomal markers are equivalently expressed in both methods. However, exosomes isolated using ultracentrifuge method are strongly contaminated with albumin and IgG. CONCLUSION: ExoQuick™ is an efficient and reproducible method to isolate exosomes for quantitative studies, whereas ultracentrifugation is not. Moreover, high albumin contamination of ultracentrifuged-derived exosomes impairs the use of protein concentration as a mean to quantify serum-derived exosomes.

Exosomes participate in the alteration of muscle homeostasis during lipid-induced insulin resistance in mice.	Diabetologia	2014	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Exosomes released from cells can transfer both functional proteins and RNAs between cells. In this study we tested the hypothesis that muscle cells might transmit specific signals during lipid-induced insulin resistance through the exosomal route. METHODS: Exosomes were collected from quadriceps muscles of C57Bl/6 mice fed for 16 weeks with either a standard chow diet (SD) or an SD enriched with 20% palm oil (HP) and from C2C12 cells exposed to 0.5 mmol/l palmitate (EXO-Post Palm), oleate (EXO-Post Oleate) or BSA (EXO-Post BSA). RESULTS: HP-fed mice were obese and insulin resistant and had altered insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation in skeletal muscle (SkM). They also had reduced expression of Myod1 and Myog and increased levels of Ccnd1 mRNA, indicating that palm oil had a deep impact on SkM homeostasis in addition to insulin resistance. HP-fed mouse SkM secreted more exosomes than SD-fed mouse SkM. This was reproduced in-vitro using C2C12 cells pre-treated with palmitate, the most abundant saturated fatty acid of palm oil. Exosomes from HP-fed mice, EXO-Post Palm and EXO-Post Oleate induced myoblast proliferation and modified the expressions of genes involved in the cell cycle and muscle differentiation but did not alter insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation. Lipidomic analyses showed that exosomes from palmitate-treated cells were enriched in palmitate, indicating that exosomes likely transfer the deleterious effect of palm oil between muscle cells by transferring lipids. Muscle exosomes were incorporated into various tissues in vivo, including the pancreas and liver, suggesting that SkM could transfer specific signals through the exosomal route to key metabolic tissues. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Exosomes act as 'paracrine-like' signals and modify muscle homeostasis during high-fat diets.	PMC4153976

MicroRNA-29b modulates innate and antigen-specific immune responses in mouse models of autoimmunity.	PLoS One	2014	In addition to important regulatory roles in gene expression through RNA interference, it has recently been shown that microRNAs display immune stimulatory effects through direct interaction with receptors of innate immunity of the Toll-like receptor family, aggravating neuronal damage and tumour growth. Yet no evidence exists on consequences of microRNA immune stimulatory actions in the context of an autoimmune disease. Using microRNA analogues, we here show that pancreatic beta cell-derived microRNA sequences induce pro-inflammatory (TNFa, IFNa, IL-12, IL-6) or suppressive (IL-10) cytokine secretion by primary mouse dendritic cells in a sequence-dependent manner. For miR-29b, immune stimulation in RAW264.7 macrophages involved the endosomal Toll-like receptor-7, independently of the canonical RNA interference pathway. In vivo, the systemic delivery of miR-29b activates CD11b+B220- myeloid and CD11b-B220+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells and induces IFNa, TNFa and IL-6 production in the serum of recipient mice. Strikingly, in a murine model of adoptive transfer of autoimmune diabetes, miR-29b reduces the cytolytic activity of transferred effector CD8+ T-cells, insulitis and disease incidence in a single standalone intervention. Endogenous miR-29b, spontaneously released from beta-cells within exosomes, stimulates TNFa secretion from spleen cells isolated from diabetes-prone NOD mice in vitro. Hence, microRNA sequences modulate innate and ongoing adaptive immune responses raising the question of their potential role in the breakdown of tolerance and opening up new applications for microRNA-based immune therapy.

Deep sequencing of RNA from three different extracellular vesicle (EV) subtypes released from the human LIM1863 colon cancer cell line uncovers distinct miRNA-enrichment signatures.	PLoS One	2014	Secreted microRNAs (miRNAs) enclosed within extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a pivotal role in intercellular communication by regulating recipient cell gene expression and affecting target cell function. Here, we report the isolation of three distinct EV subtypes from the human colon carcinoma cell line LIM1863--shed microvesicles (sMVs) and two exosome populations (immunoaffinity isolated A33-exosomes and EpCAM-exosomes). Deep sequencing of miRNA libraries prepared from parental LIM1863 cells/derived EV subtype RNA yielded 254 miRNA identifications, of which 63 are selectively enriched in the EVs--miR-19a/b-3p, miR-378a/c/d, and miR-577 and members of the let-7 and miR-8 families being the most prominent. Let-7a-3p*, let-7f-1-3p*, miR-451a, miR-574-5p*, miR-4454 and miR-7641 are common to all EV subtypes, and 6 miRNAs (miR-320a/b/c/d, miR-221-3p, and miR-200c-3p) discern LIM1863 exosomes from sMVs; miR-98-5p was selectively represented only in sMVs. Notably, A33-Exos contained the largest number (32) of exclusively-enriched miRNAs; 14 of these miRNAs have not been reported in the context of CRC tissue/biofluid analyses and warrant further examination as potential diagnostic markers of CRC. Surprisingly, miRNA passenger strands (star miRNAs) for miR-3613-3p*, -362-3p*, -625-3p*, -6842-3p* were the dominant strand in A33-Exos, the converse to that observed in parental cells. This finding suggests miRNA biogenesis may be interlinked with endosomal/exosomal processing.	PMC4201526

J Natl Cancer Inst	2015	BACKGROUND: Regulatory T cells (Treg) and tumor-exosomes are thought to play a role in preventing the rejection of malignant cells in patients bearing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: Treg recruitment by exosomes derived from NPC cell lines (C15/C17-Exo), exosomes isolated from NPC patients' plasma (Patient-Exo), and CCL20 were tested in vitro using Boyden chamber assays and in vivo using a xenograft SCID mouse model (n = 5), both in the presence and absence of anti-CCL20 monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Impact of these NPC exosomes (NPC-Exo) on Treg phenotype and function was determined using adapted assays (FACS, Q-PCR, ELISA, and MLR). Experiments were performed in comparison with exosomes derived from plasma of healthy donors (HD-Exo). The Student's t test was used for group comparisons. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: CCL20 allowed the intratumoral recruitment of human Treg. NPC-Exo also facilitated Treg recruitment (3.30 ± 0.34 fold increase, P < .001), which was statistically significantly inhibited (P < .001) by an anti-CCL20 blocking mAb. NPC-Exo also recruited conventional CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells and mediated their conversion into inhibitory CD4(+)CD25(high) cells. Moreover, NPC-Exo enhanced (P = .0048) the expansion of human Treg, inducing the generation of Tim3(Low) Treg with increased expression of CD25 and FOXP3. Finally, NPC-Exo induced an overexpression of cell markers associated with Treg phenotype, properties and recruitment capacity. For example, GZMB mean fold change was 21.45 ± 1.75 (P < .001). These results were consistent with a stronger suppression of responder cells' proliferation and the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL10, TGFB1). CONCLUSION: Interactions between NPC-Exo and Treg represent a newly defined mechanism that may be involved in regulating peripheral tolerance by tumors and in supporting immune evasion in human NPC.

Electronic address: .	yutliu@gru.edu		Human aqueous humor exosomes.	Exp Eye Res	2015	Aqueous humor (AH) is a dynamic intraocular fluid that supports the vitality of tissues that regulate intraocular pressure. We recently discovered that extracellular nanovesicles called exosomes are a major constituent of AH. Exosomes function in extracellular communication and contain proteins and small RNA. Our goal was to characterize the physical properties of AH exosomes and their exosomal RNA (esRNA) content. We isolated exosomes from human AH collected during cataract surgery from five patients using serial ultracentrifugation. We measured the size and concentration of AH exosomes in solution using nanoparticle tracking analysis. We found a single population of vesicles having a mean size of 121 ± 11 nm in the unprocessed AH. Data show that centrifugation does not significantly affect the mean particle size (121 ± 11 nm versus 124 ± 21 nm), but does impact the final number of exosomes in solution (87% loss from the unprocessed AH; n = 5). We extracted esRNA from the pooled human AH samples using miRCURY RNA isolation kit from Exiqon. The quality of extracted esRNA was evaluated using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and was used to generate a sequencing library for small RNA sequencing with Illumina MiSeq sequencer. More than 10 different miRNAs were identified; abundant species included miR-486-5p, miR-204, and miR-184. We found that the majority of extracellular vesicles in the AH were in the exosome size range, suggesting that miRNAs housed within exosomes may function in communication between AH inflow and outflow tissues.

Commercial cow milk contains physically stable extracellular vesicles expressing immunoregulatory TGF-β.	PLoS One	2015	SCOPE: Extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, have been identified in all biological fluids and rediscovered as an important part of the intercellular communication. Breast milk also contains extracellular vesicles and the proposed biological function is to enhance the antimicrobial defense in newborns. It is, however, unknown whether extracellular vesicles are still present in commercial milk and, more importantly, whether they retained their bioactivity. Here, we characterize the extracellular vesicles present in semi-skimmed cow milk available for consumers and study their effect on T cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Extracellular vesicles from commercial milk were isolated and characterized. Milk-derived extracellular vesicles contained several immunomodulating miRNAs and membrane protein CD63, characteristics of exosomes. In contrast to RAW 267.4 derived extracellular vesicles the milk-derived extracellular vesicles were extremely stable under degrading conditions, including low pH, boiling and freezing. Milk-derived extracellular vesicles were easily taken up by murine macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, we found that they can facilitate T cell differentiation towards the pathogenic Th17 lineage. Using a (CAGA)12-luc reporter assay we showed that these extracellular vesicles carried bioactive TGF-β, and that anti-TGF-β antibodies blocked Th17 differentiation. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that commercial milk contains stable extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, and carry immunoregulatory cargo. These data suggest that the extracellular vesicles present in commercial cow milk remains intact in the gastrointestinal tract and exert an immunoregulatory effect.	PMC4379073
25955015	Haijun Zhong	Department of Chemotherapy, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital , Hangzhou .			Increased anti-tumour activity by exosomes derived from doxorubicin-treated tumour cells via heat stress.	Int J Hyperthermia	2015	PURPOSE: Tumour-cell-derived exosomes (Exo) have been proposed as a new kind of drug carrier, and heat stress can promote release of exosomes from tumour cells. This study investigated the impact of heat stress on the quantity of doxorubicin in exosomes from the same number of doxorubicin-treated MFC-7 tumour cells and their anti-tumour effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from phosphate-buffered saline (Exo), doxorubicin (Exo-Dox) or doxorubicin combined with heat-stress-treated (Exo-Dox-HS) MCF-7 cells. The content of doxorubicin in the exosomes was determined by flow cytometry. The effects of individual types of exosomes on the MCF-7 cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as the tumour growth were determined by MTT assay, flow cytometry and murine xenograft tumour modelling. RESULTS: We found that the amount of Exo-Dox-HS was higher than that of Exo-Dox from the same number of MCF-7 cells, and Exo-Dox-HS contained higher levels of doxorubicin than Exo-Dox from the same number of cells. Exo-Dox and Exo-Dox-HS, but not Exo or 10 µg/mL doxorubicin, significantly inhibited the MCF-7 cell proliferation and triggered MCF-7 cell apoptosis, associated with increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and -8 and morphological changes in MCF-7 cells. Treatment with Exo-Dox and Exo-Dox-HS inhibited the growth of implanted breast tumours in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that heat stress increased the quantity of doxorubicin-containing exosomes from tumour cells, and enhanced the anti-tumour effect of exosomes from the doxorubicin-treated tumour cells. Our findings may aid in designing new strategies for cancer therapy by combination of chemotherapy and hyperthermia.

Pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer exosome-induced lipolysis in adipose tissue.	Gut	2016	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: New-onset diabetes and concomitant weight loss occurring several months before the clinical presentation of pancreatic cancer (PC) appear to be paraneoplastic phenomena caused by tumour-secreted products. Our recent findings have shown exosomal adrenomedullin (AM) is important in development of diabetes in PC. Adipose tissue lipolysis might explain early onset weight loss in PC. We hypothesise that lipolysis-inducing cargo is carried in exosomes shed by PC and is responsible for the paraneoplastic effects. Therefore, in this study we investigate if exosomes secreted by PC induce lipolysis in adipocytes and explore the role of AM in PC-exosomes as the mediator of this lipolysis. DESIGN: Exosomes from patient-derived cell lines and from plasma of patients with PC and non-PC controls were isolated and characterised. Differentiated murine (3T3-L1) and human adipocytes were exposed to these exosomes to study lipolysis. Glycerol assay and western blotting were used to study lipolysis. Duolink Assay was used to study AM and adrenomedullin receptor (ADMR) interaction in adipocytes treated with exosomes. RESULTS: In murine and human adipocytes, we found that both AM and PC-exosomes promoted lipolysis, which was abrogated by ADMR blockade. AM interacted with its receptor on the adipocytes, activated p38 and extracellular signal-regulated (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinases and promoted lipolysis by phosphorylating hormone-sensitive lipase. PKH67-labelled PC-exosomes were readily internalised into adipocytes and involved both caveolin and macropinocytosis as possible mechanisms for endocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: PC-secreted exosomes induce lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue; exosomal AM is a candidate mediator of this effect.	PMC5323066

Exosomal transfer of vasorin expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells promotes migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.	Int J Biol Sci	2015	Vasorin (VASN) is a type I transmembrane protein that plays important roles in tumor development and vasculogenesis. In this paper, we showed that VASN could be a key mediator of communication between tumor cells and endothelial cells. We confirmed for the first time that HepG2-derived VASN can be transferred to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via receptor mediated endocytosis of exosomes, at least in part through HSPGs. The HepG2-derived VASN containing exosomes promote migration of recipient HUVECs cells. Our results identify a novel pathway by which a functional protein expressed in tumor cells affects the biological fate of endothelial cells via exosomes.	PMC4495413

Stem Cell Res Ther	2015	INTRODUCTION: 'Patient-specific' induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are attractive because they can generate abundant cells without the risk of immune rejection for cell therapy. Studies have shown that iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) possess powerful proliferation, differentiation, and therapeutic effects. Recently, most studies indicate that stem cells exert their therapeutic effect mainly through a paracrine mechanism other than transdifferentiation, and exosomes have emerged as an important paracrine factor for stem cells to reprogram injured cells. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether exosomes derived from iMSCs (iMSCs-Exo) possess the ability to attenuate limb ischemia and promote angiogenesis after transplantation into limbs of mice with femoral artery excision. METHODS: Human iPSCs (iPS-S-01, C1P33, and PCKDSF001C1) were used to differentiate into iMSCs in a modified one-step method. iMSCs were characterized by flow cytometry and multipotent differentiation potential analysis. Ultrafiltration combined with a purification method was used to isolate iMSCs-Exo, and transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting were used to identify iMSCs-Exo. After establishment of mouse hind-limb ischemia with excision of femoral artery and iMSCs-Exo injection, blood perfusion was monitored at days 0, 7, 14, and 21; microvessel density in ischemic muscle was also analyzed. In vitro migration, proliferation, and tube formation experiments were used to analyze the ability of pro-angiogenesis in iMSCs-Exo, and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to identify expression levels of angiogenesis-related molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after being cultured with iMSCs-Exo. RESULTS: iPSCs were efficiently induced into iMSC- with MSC-positive and -negative surface antigens and osteogenesis, adipogenesis, and chondrogenesis differentiation potential. iMSCs-Exo with a diameter of 57 ± 11 nm and expressed CD63, CD81, and CD9. Intramuscular injection of iMSCs-Exo markedly enhanced microvessel density and blood perfusion in mouse ischemic limbs, consistent with an attenuation of ischemic injury. In addition, iMSCs-Exo could activate angiogenesis-related molecule expression and promote HUVEC migration, proliferation, and tube formation. CONCLUSION: Implanted iMSCs-Exo was able to protect limbs from ischemic injury via the promotion of angiogenesis, which indicated that iMSCs-Exo may be a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of ischemic diseases.

Lectin-induced agglutination method of urinary exosomes isolation followed by mi-RNA analysis: Application for prostate cancer diagnostic.	Prostate	2016	BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Prostate-specific antigen has, however, insufficient diagnostic specificity. Novel complementary diagnostic approaches are greatly needed. MiRNAs are small regulatory RNAs which play an important role in tumorogenesis and are being investigated as a cancer biomarker. In addition to their intracellular regulatory functions, miRNAs are secreted into the extracellular space and can be found in various body fluids, including urine. The stability of extracellular miRNAs is defined by association with proteins, lipoprotein particles, and membrane vesicles. Among the known forms of miRNA packaging, tumour-derived exosome-enclosed miRNAs is thought to reflect the vital activity of cancer cells. The assessment of the exosomal fraction of urinary miRNA may present a new and highly specific method for prostate cancer diagnostics; however, this is challenged by the absence of reliable and inexpensive methods for isolation of exosomes. METHODS: Prostate cancer (PC) cell lines and urine samples collected from 35 PC patients and 35 healthy donors were used in the study. Lectins, phytohemagglutinin, and concanavalin A were used to induce agglutination of exosomes. The efficiency of isolation process was evaluated by AFM and DLS assays. The protein content of isolated exosomes was analysed by western blotting. Exosomal RNA was assayed by automated electrophoresis and expression level of selected miRNAs was evaluated by RT-qPCR. The diagnostic potency of the urinary exosomal miRNA assessment was estimated by the ROC method. RESULTS: The formation of multi-vesicular agglutinates in urine can be induced by incubation with lectin at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. These agglutinates contain urinary exosomes and may be pelleted by centrifugation with a relatively low G-force. The analysis of PC-related miRNA in urinary exosomes revealed significant up-regulation of miR-574-3p, miR-141-5p, and miR-21-5p associated with PC. CONCLUSIONS: Lectin-induced aggregation is a low-cost and easily performed method for isolation of exosomes from urine. Isolated exosomes can be further analysed in terms of miRNA content. The miRNA profile of urinary exosomes reflects development of prostate cancer and may present a promising diagnostic tool.

Computational Characterization of Exogenous MicroRNAs that Can Be Transferred into Human Circulation.	PLoS One	2015	MicroRNAs have been long considered synthesized endogenously until very recent discoveries showing that human can absorb dietary microRNAs from animal and plant origins while the mechanism remains unknown. Compelling evidences of microRNAs from rice, milk, and honeysuckle transported to human blood and tissues have created a high volume of interests in the fundamental questions that which and how exogenous microRNAs can be transferred into human circulation and possibly exert functions in humans. Here we present an integrated genomics and computational analysis to study the potential deciding features of transportable microRNAs. Specifically, we analyzed all publicly available microRNAs, a total of 34,612 from 194 species, with 1,102 features derived from the microRNA sequence and structure. Through in-depth bioinformatics analysis, 8 groups of discriminative features have been used to characterize human circulating microRNAs and infer the likelihood that a microRNA will get transferred into human circulation. For example, 345 dietary microRNAs have been predicted as highly transportable candidates where 117 of them have identical sequences with their homologs in human and 73 are known to be associated with exosomes. Through a milk feeding experiment, we have validated 9 cow-milk microRNAs in human plasma using microRNA-sequencing analysis, including the top ranked microRNAs such as bta-miR-487b, miR-181b, and miR-421. The implications in health-related processes have been illustrated in the functional analysis. This work demonstrates the data-driven computational analysis is highly promising to study novel molecular characteristics of transportable microRNAs while bypassing the complex mechanistic details.

Placenta Mesenchymal Stem Cell Derived Exosomes Confer Plasticity on Fibroblasts.	J Cell Biochem	2016	Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-conditioned medium (MSC-CM) has been reported to enhance wound healing. Exosomes contain nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, and function as an intercellular communication vehicle for mediating some paracrine effects. However, the function of MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-exo) remains elusive. In this study, we isolated human placenta MSC (PlaMSC)-derived exosomes (PlaMSC-exo) and examined their function in vitro. PlaMSCs were isolated from human term placenta using enzymatic digestion. PlaMSC-exo were prepared from the conditioned medium of PlaMSC (PlaMSC-CM) by ultracentrifugation. The expression of stemness-related genes, such as OCT4 and NANOG, in normal adult human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) after incubation with PlaMSC-exo was measured by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR analysis (real-time PCR). The effect of PlaMSC-exo on OCT4 transcription activity was assessed using Oct4-EGFP reporter mice-derived dermal fibroblasts. The stimulating effects of PlaMSC-exo on osteoblastic and adipocyte-differentiation of NHDF were evaluated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and Alizarin red S- and oil red O-staining, respectively. The expression of osteoblast- and adipocyte-related genes was also assessed by real-time PCR. The treatment of NHDF with PlaMSC-exo significantly upregulated OCT4 and NANOG mRNA expression. PlaMSC-exo also enhanced OCT4 transcription. The NHDF treated with PlaMSC-exo exhibited osteoblastic and adipocyte-differentiation in osteogenic and adipogenic induction media. PlaMSC-exo increase the expression of OCT4 and NANOG mRNA in fibroblasts. As a result, PlaMSC-exo influence the differentiation competence of fibroblasts to both osteoblastic and adipocyte-differentiation. It shows a new feature of MSCs and the possibility of clinical application of MSC-exo. J. Cell. Biochem. 117: 1658-1670, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J Neurooncol	2016	The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether blood-borne microvesicles from newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients could be used as biomarkers. We collected 2.8 mL blood from 16 post-operative patients at the time that they were being simulated for chemoradiation therapy (radiation with concurrent temozolomide). Two additional samples were collected during chemoradiation therapy and a final sample was collected at the end of chemoradiation therapy. Patients continued with the therapy suggested by their physicians, based on tumor conference consensus and were followed for recurrence and overall survival. Microvesicles were isolated using serial centrifugation and stained for surface markers (Annexin V for phosphotidyl serine, CD41 for platelets, anti-EGFR for tumor cells, and CD235 for red blood cells). Flow cytometry analysis was performed. Our findings provide initial evidence that increases in Annexin V positive microvesicle levels during chemoradiation therapy are associated with earlier recurrence and shorter overall survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. The effect is dramatic, with over a four-fold increase in the hazard ratio for an individual at the 75th versus the 25th percentile. Moreover the pattern of Annexin V positive microvesicles remain significant after adjustment for confounding clinical variables that have previously been shown to be prognostic for recurrence and survival. Inclusion of neutrophil levels at the start of chemoradiation therapy in the model yielded the largest attenuation of the observed association. Further studies will be needed to verify and further investigate the association between these two entities.	PMC4783260

Cell Tissue Res	2016	Our objective has been to establish a pro-angiogenic role for exosomes in endometriosis and to determine whether a differential expression profile of cellular and exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) exists in endometriosis. We performed an in vitro study of human primary endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We isolated and characterized exosomes from ESCs from five endometriosis patients and five phase-matched controls. Exosomes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and NanoSight technology. MiRNA was assessed by deep sequencing and reverse transcription with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Exosome uptake studies were achieved by means of confocal microscopy. The pro-angiogenic experiments were executed by treating HUVECs with ESC-derived exosomes. We observed differential profiles of exosomal miRNA expression between exosomes derived from endometriosis lesion cells and diseased eutopic stromal cells compared with exosomes derived from control ESCs. We also demonstrated autocrine cellular uptake of exosomes and paracrine functional angiogenic effects of exosomes on HUVECs. The results of this study support the hypothesis that exosomes derived from ESCs play autocrine/paracrine roles in the development of endometriosis, potentially modulating angiogenesis. The broader clinical implications are that Sampson's theory of retrograde menstruation possibly encompasses the finding that exosomes work as intercellular communication modulators in endometriosis.

Oncogenic epithelial cell-derived exosomes containing Rac1 and PAK2 induce angiogenesis in recipient endothelial cells.	Oncotarget	2016	The metastatic cascade describes the escape of primary tumour cells to distant secondary sites. Cells at the leading tumour edge are thought to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), to enhance their motility and invasion for spreading. Whether EMT cells directly promote tumour angiogenesis, and the role of exosomes (30-150 nm extracellular vesicles) remains largely unknown. We examined the functional effects of exosomes from MDCK cells, MDCK cells stably expressing YBX1 (MDCKYBX1, intermediate EMT), and Ras-transformed MDCK cells (21D1 cells, complete EMT). 2F-2B cell motility and tube formation (length and branching) was significantly increased following supplementation with MDCKYBX1 or 21D1 exosomes, but not MDCK exosomes. Next, Matrigel™ plugs containing exosome-supplemented 2F-2B cells were subcutaneously injected into mice. Systemic perfusion was only observed for plugs supplemented with MDCKYBX1 or 21D1 exosomes. Comparative proteomics revealed that 21D1 exosomes contained VEGF-associated proteins, while MDCKYBX1 exosomes were enriched with activated Rac1 and PAK2. To validate, 2F-2B cells and HUVECs were pre-treated with PAK inhibitors prior to exosome supplementation. PAK inhibition nullified the effects of MDCKYBX1 exosomes by reducing the tube length and branching to baseline levels. By contrast, the effects of 21D1 exosomes were not significantly decreased. Our results demonstrate for the first time that oncogenic cells undergoing EMT can communicate with endothelial cells via exosomes, and establish exosomal Rac1/PAK2 as angiogenic promoters that may function from early stages of the metastatic cascade.

A method that meets these criteria and can be scaled up for patient monitoring is thus desirable. METHODS: Plasma specimens (1 mL) of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were differentially centrifuged, ultrafiltered and fractionated by size exclusion chromatography in small disposable columns (mini-SEC). Exosomes were eluted in phosphate-buffered saline and were evaluated by qNano for particle size and counts, morphology by transmission electron microscopy, protein content, molecular profiles by western blots, and for ability to modify functions of immune cells. RESULTS: Exosomes eluting in fractions #3-5 had a diameter ranging from 50 to 200 nm by qNano, with the fraction #4 containing the bulk of clean, unaggregated exosomes. The exosome elution profiles remained constant for repeated runs of the same plasma. Larger plasma volumes could be fractionated running multiple mini-SEC columns in parallel. Particle concentrations per millilitre of plasma in #4 fractions of AML and HNSCC were comparable and were higher (p<0.003) than those in normal controls. Isolated AML exosomes co-incubated with normal human NK cells inhibited NKG2D expression levels (p<0.004), and HNSCC exosomes suppressed activation (p<0.01) and proliferation of activated T lymphocytes (p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Mini-SEC allows for simple and reproducible isolation from human plasma of exosomes retaining structural integrity and functional activity. It enables molecular/functional analysis of the exosome content in serial specimens of human plasma for clinical applications.	PMC4808740

Radiat Oncol	2016	BACKGROUND: Risk of normal tissue toxicity limits the amount of thoracic radiation therapy (RT) that can be routinely prescribed to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). An early biomarker of response to thoracic RT may provide a way to predict eventual toxicities-such as radiation pneumonitis-during treatment, thereby enabling dose adjustment before the symptomatic onset of late effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were studied as potential serological biomarkers for thoracic RT. As a first step, we sought to identify miRNAs that correlate with delivered dose and standard dosimetric factors. METHODS: We performed miRNA profiling of plasma samples obtained from five patients with Stage IIIA NSCLC at five dose-points each during radical thoracic RT. Candidate miRNAs were then assessed in samples from a separate cohort of 21 NSCLC patients receiving radical thoracic RT. To identify a cellular source of circulating miRNAs, we quantified in vitro miRNA expression intracellularly and within secreted exosomes in five NSCLC and stromal cell lines. RESULTS: miRNA profiling of the discovery cohort identified ten circulating miRNAs that correlated with delivered RT dose as well as other dosimetric parameters such as lung V20. In the validation cohort, miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p were reproducibly shown to decrease with increasing radiation dose. Expression of miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p in secreted exosomes decreased with radiation. This was concomitant with an increase in intracellular levels, suggesting that exosomal export of these miRNAs may be downregulated in both NSCLC and stromal cells in response to radiation. CONCLUSIONS: miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p were identified as circulating biomarkers that correlated with delivered RT dose. miR-150 has been reported to decrease in the circulation of mammals exposed to radiation while miR-29a has been associated with fibrosis in the human heart, lungs, and kidneys. One may therefore hypothesize that outlier levels of circulating miR-29a-3p and miR-150-5p may eventually help predict unexpected responses to radiation therapy, such as toxicity.	PMC4847218

Exosome-mediated activation of toll-like receptor 3 in stellate cells stimulates interleukin-17 production by γδ T cells in liver fibrosis.	Hepatology	2016	During liver injury, hepatocytes secrete exosomes that include diverse types of self-RNAs. Recently, self-noncoding RNA has been recognized as an activator of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). However, the roles of hepatic exosomes and TLR3 in liver fibrosis are not yet fully understood. Following acute liver injury and early-stage liver fibrosis induced by a single or 2-week injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ), increased interleukin (IL)-17A production was detected primarily in hepatic γδ T cells in wild-type (WT) mice. However, liver fibrosis and IL-17A production by γδ T cells were both significantly attenuated in TLR3 knockout (KO) mice compared with WT mice. More interestingly, IL-17A-producing γδ T cells were in close contact with activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), suggesting a role for HSCs in IL-17A production by γδ T cells. In vitro treatments with exosomes derived from CCl4 -treated hepatocytes significantly increased the expression of IL-17A, IL-1β, and IL-23 in WT HSCs but not in TLR3 KO HSCs. Furthermore, IL-17A production by γδ T cells was substantially increased upon coculturing with exosome-treated WT HSCs or conditioned medium from TLR3-activated WT HSCs. However, similar increases were not detected when γδ T cells were cocultured with exosome-treated HSCs from IL-17A KO or TLR3 KO mice. Using reciprocal bone marrow transplantation between WT and TLR3 KO mice, we found that TLR3 deficiency in HSCs contributed to decreased IL-17A production by γδ T cells, as well as liver fibrosis. CONCLUSION: In liver injury, the exosome-mediated activation of TLR3 in HSCs exacerbates liver fibrosis by enhancing IL-17A production by γδ T cells, which might be associated with HSC stimulation by unknown self-TLR3 ligands from damaged hepatocytes. Therefore, TLR3 might be a novel therapeutic target for liver fibrosis. (Hepatology 2016;64:616-631).

Macrophages transfer antigens to dendritic cells by releasing exosomes containing dead-cell-associated antigens partially through a ceramide-dependent pathway to enhance CD4(+) T-cell responses.	Immunology	2016	Defects in rapid clearance of apoptotic cells lead to an accumulation of dead cells (late apoptotic or secondary necrotic cells), which results in an aberrant immune response. However, little is known about whether and how macrophages (Mφs) cooperate with dendritic cells (DCs) in the presentation of dead-cell-associated antigens in this process. By transferring high numbers of dead cells to mimic a failure of apoptotic cell clearance in vivo, we found that Mφs and neutrophils were the predominant phagocytes in the uptake of dead cells in the spleen. Moreover, both Mφs and DCs were required for an optimal CD4(+) T-cell response triggered by dead-cell-associated antigens. Importantly, although Mφs alone had a poor capacity for antigen presentation, they could transfer phagocytosed antigens to DCs for potent antigen presentation to enhance T-cell responses. Finally, we found that exosomes released from Mφs acted as a transmitter to convey antigens to DCs partially in a ceramide-dependent manner, since treatment with the neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor GW4869 and spiroepoxide resulted in a significant reduction of T-cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. These findings point to a novel pathway of cross-talk between Mφs and DCs, which will be helpful to explain possible mechanisms for autoimmune diseases characterized by increased rates of apoptosis.

Notch Signaling Mediates Skeletal Muscle Atrophy in Cancer Cachexia Caused by Osteosarcoma.	Sarcoma	2016	Skeletal muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia is mediated by the interaction between muscle stem cells and various tumor factors. Although Notch signaling has been known as a key regulator of both cancer development and muscle stem cell activity, the potential involvement of Notch signaling in cancer cachexia and concomitant muscle atrophy has yet to be elucidated. The murine K7M2 osteosarcoma cell line was used to generate an orthotopic model of sarcoma-associated cachexia, and the role of Notch signaling was evaluated. Skeletal muscle atrophy was observed in the sarcoma-bearing mice, and Notch signaling was highly active in both tumor tissues and the atrophic skeletal muscles. Systemic inhibition of Notch signaling reduced muscle atrophy. In vitro coculture of osteosarcoma cells with muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) isolated from normal mice resulted in decreased myogenic potential of MDSCs, while the application of Notch inhibitor was able to rescue this repressed myogenic potential. We further observed that Notch-activating factors reside in the exosomes of osteosarcoma cells, which activate Notch signaling in MDSCs and subsequently repress myogenesis. Our results revealed that signaling between tumor and muscle via the Notch pathway may play an important role in mediating the skeletal muscle atrophy seen in cancer cachexia.	PMC4917717

Stem Cells Transl Med	2016	: Paracrine signaling by bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) plays a major role in tissue repair. Although the production of regulatory cytokines by MSC transplantation is a critical modulator of tissue regeneration, we focused on exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles that contain proteins and nucleic acids, as a novel additional modulator of cell-to-cell communication and tissue regeneration. To address this, we used radiologic imaging, histological examination, and immunohistochemical analysis to evaluate the role of exosomes isolated from MSC-conditioned medium (CM) in the healing process in a femur fracture model of CD9-/- mice, a strain that is known to produce reduced levels of exosomes. We found that the bone union rate in CD9-/- mice was significantly lower than wild-type mice because of the retardation of callus formation. The retardation of fracture healing in CD9-/- mice was rescued by the injection of exosomes, but this was not the case after the injection of exosomes-free conditioned medium (CM-Exo). The levels of the bone repair-related cytokines, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), MCP-3, and stromal cell-derived factor-1 in exosomes were low compared with levels in CM and CM-Exo, suggesting that bone repair may be in part mediated by other exosome components, such as microRNAs. These results suggest that exosomes in CM facilitate the acceleration of fracture healing, and we conclude that exosomes are a novel factor of MSC paracrine signaling with an important role in the tissue repair process. SIGNIFICANCE: This work focuses on exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles, as a novel additional modulator of cell-to-cell communication. This study evaluated the role of exosomes isolated from mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-conditioned medium (MSC-CM) in the fracture-healing process of CD9-/- mice, a strain that is known to produce reduced levels of exosomes. Retardation of fracture healing in CD9-/- mice was rescued by the injection of MSC exosomes, but this was not the case after the injection of exosome-free CM. This study finds that MSC exosomes are a novel factor of MSC paracrine signaling, with an important role in the tissue repair process.	PMC5189643

Human vaginal fluid contains exosomes that have an inhibitory effect on an early step of the HIV-1 life cycle.	AIDS	2016	OBJECTIVE: Vaginal transmission is crucial to the spread of HIV-1 around the world. It is not yet clear what type (s) of innate defenses against HIV-1 infection are present in the vagina. Here, we aimed to determine whether human vaginal fluid contains exosomes that may possess anti-HIV-1 activity. METHODS: The exosomal fraction was isolated from samples of vaginal fluids. The presence of exosomes was confirmed by flow cytometry and western blotting. The newly discovered exosomes were tested for their ability to block early steps of HIV-1 infection in vitro using established cell culture systems and real time PCR-based methods. RESULTS: Vaginal fluid contains exosomes expressing CD9, CD63, and CD81 exosomal markers. The exosomal fraction of the fluid-reduced transmission of HIV-1 vectors by 60%, the efficiency of reverse transcription step by 58.4%, and the efficiency of integration by 47%. Exosomes had no effect on the entry of HIV-1 vectors. CONCLUSION: Human vaginal fluid exosomes are newly discovered female innate defenses that may protect women against HIV-1 infection.

Effect on Intermittent Hypoxia on Plasma Exosomal Micro RNA Signature and Endothelial Function in Healthy Adults.	Sleep	2016	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Exosomes are secreted by most cell types and released in biological fluids, including plasma, and play a role in modifying the functional phenotype of target cells. Using an experimental human model of IH, we investigated potential exosome-derived biomarkers of IH-induced vascular dysfunction. METHODS: Ten male volunteers were exposed to room air (D0), IH (6 h/day) for 4 days (D4) and allowed to recover for 4 days (D8). Circulating plasma exosomes were isolated and incubated with human endothelial monolayer cultures for impedance measurements and RNA extracted and processed with messenger RNA (mRNA) arrays to identify gene targets. In addition, immunofluorescent assessments of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA expression, ICAM-1 cellular distribution were conducted. RESULTS: Plasma exosomal micro RNAs (miRNAs) were profiled. D4 exosomes, primarily from endothelial sources, disrupted impedance levels compared to D0 and D8. ICAM-1 expression was markedly upregulated in endothelial cells exposed to D4 exosomes along with significant reductions in eNOS expression. Microarray approaches identified a restricted and further validated signature of exosomal miRNAs in D4 exosomes, and mRNA arrays revealed putative endothelial gene target pathways. CONCLUSIONS: In humans, intermittent hypoxia alters exosome cargo in the circulation which promotes increased permeability and dysfunction of endothelial cells in vitro. A select number of circulating exosomal miRNAs may play important roles in the cardiovascular dysfunction associated with OSA by targeting specific effector pathways.	PMC5103796

Cancer Lett	2017	Exosomes-secreted microRNAs play an important role in metastatic spread. During this process breast cancer cells acquire the ability to transmigrate through blood vessels by inducing changes in the endothelial barrier. We focused on miR-939 that is predicted to target VE-cadherin, a component of adherens junction involved in vessel permeability. By in silico analysis miR-939 was found highly expressed in the basal-like tumor subtypes and in our cohort of 63 triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) its expression significantly interacted with lymph node status in predicting disease-free survival probability. We demonstrated, in vitro, that miR-939 directly targets VE-cadherin leading to an increase in HUVECs monolayer permeability. MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with a miR-939 mimic, released miR-939 in exosomes that, once internalized in endothelial cells, favored trans-endothelial migration of MDA-MB-231-GFP cells by the disruption of the endothelial barrier. Notably, when up taken in endothelial cells exosomes caused VE-cadherin down-regulation specifically through miR-939 as we demonstrated by inhibiting miR-939 expression in exosomes-releasing TNBC cells. Together, our data indentify an extracellular pro-tumorigenic role for tumor-derived, exosome-associated miR-939 that can explain its association with worse prognosis in TNBCs.

Methods Mol Biol	2017	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common condition causing progressive visual impairment, leading to irreversible blindness. Existing diagnostic tools for AMD are limited to clinical signs in the macula and the visual assessment of the patient. The presence of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the peripheral circulatory system with potential as diagnostic, prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers has been reported in a number of conditions/diseases. miRNAs are key regulators of several biological processes, and miRNA dysregulation has been linked with numerous diseases, most remarkably cancer. miRNAs have been shown to be involved in AMD pathology and several miRNAs target genes and signaling pathways were identified in relation to AMD pathogenesis. Exosomes are 50-90 nm membrane micro-vesicles (MVs), released by several cell types. Although exosomal functions are not completely understood, there is much evidence to suggest that exosomes play an essential role in cell-cell communication. They may stimulate target cells by transferring different bioactive molecules such as miRNA. Here we discuss methods to isolate exosome using serum specimens from AMD patients and miRNA profiling for the better understanding of the disease.

Spleen-Dependent Immune Protection Elicited by CpG Adjuvanted Reticulocyte-Derived Exosomes from Malaria Infection Is Associated with Changes in T cell Subsets' Distribution.	Front Cell Dev Biol	2016	Reticulocyte-derived exosomes (rex) are 30-100 nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin released during the maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes upon fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. Combination of CpG-ODN with rex obtained from BALB/c mice infected with the reticulocyte-prone non-lethal P. yoelii 17X malaria strain (rexPy), had been shown to induce survival and long lasting protection. Here, we show that splenectomized mice are not protected upon rexPy+CpG inmunizations and that protection is restored upon passive transfer of splenocytes obtained from animals immunized with rexPy+CpG. Notably, rexPy immunization of mice induced changes in PD1- memory T cells with effector phenotype. Proteomics analysis of rexPy confirmed their reticulocyte origin and demonstrated the presence of parasite antigens. Our studies thus prove, for what we believe is the first time, that rex from reticulocyte-prone malarial infections are associated with splenic long-lasting memory responses. To try extrapolating these data to human infections, in vitro experiments with spleen cells of human transplantation donors were performed. Plasma-derived exosomes from vivax malaria patients (exPv) were actively uptaken by human splenocytes and stimulated spleen cells leading to changes in T cell subsets.	PMC5110551

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2017	Maternal diabetes mellitus induces an increased risk of congenital heart defects (CHD), however, the exact mechanisms are still not fully illustrated. In this study, diabetic pregnant C57BL/6 mice were induced by injection of streptozotocin before mating. Compared with the control normal mice, diabetic pregnant mice displayed significant changes of the exosomal miRNA contents in the blood, as revealed by RNA-seq analysis. Multiple of these miRNAs were found involved in cardiac development regulation. Moreover, fluorescence labeled exosomes and gold nanoparticles could cross the placenta barrier and infiltrated into the embryonic organs/tissues, including the heart, during embryonic development. Injection of diabetic maternal exosomes strikingly increased the risk of CHD in the normal recipient pregnant mice. Taken together, we could draw the conclusion that maternal exosomes in diabetes could cross the maternal-fetal barrier and contribute to the cardiac development deficiency possibly via miRNAs, providing new insights in CHD prevention and treatment.

Front Mol Neurosci	2016	The accumulation in neurons of aberrant protein species, the pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, results from a global impairment of key cellular processes governing protein synthesis/degradation and repair mechanisms, also known as the proteostasis network (PN). The growing number of connections between dysfunction of this intricate network of pathways and diseases of the motor unit, where both motor neurons and muscle are primarily affected, has provided momentum to investigate the muscle- and motor neuron-specific response to physiological and pathological stressors and to explore the therapeutic opportunities that manipulation of this process may offer. Furthermore, these diseases offer an unparalleled opportunity to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the intertissue communication and transfer of signals of proteostasis. The most compelling aspect of these investigations is their immediate potential for therapeutic impact: targeting muscle to stem degeneration of the motor unit would represent a dramatic paradigm therapeutic shift for treating these devastating diseases. Here we will review the current state of the art of the research on the alterations of the PN in diseases of the motor unit and its potential to result in effective treatments for these devastating neuromuscular disorders.

Characterization of Protein Content Present in Exosomes Isolated from Conditioned Media and Urine.	Curr Protoc Protein Sci	2017	Cells secrete biomolecules into the extracellular space as a way of intercellular communication. Secreted proteins can act as ligands that engage specific receptors-on the same cell, nearby cells, or distant cells-and induce defined signaling pathways. Proteins and other biomolecules can also be packaged as cargo molecules within vesicles that are released to the extracellular space (termed extracellular vesicles or EVs). A subclass of such EVs, exosomes have been shown to horizontally transfer information. In recent years, exosomes have sparked tremendous interest in biological research, both for the discovery of novel biomarkers and for the identification of signaling molecules, as part of their cargo. Although multiple methods have been described for the isolation of exosomes, described here is a simple differential centrifugation approach that is well suited for the isolation of exosomes from conditioned cell culture media and urine. Mass spectrometry provides an ideal method to comprehensively analyze the protein cargo of exosomes. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

GPC1 exosome and its regulatory miRNAs are specific markers for the detection and target therapy of colorectal cancer.	J Cell Mol Med	2017	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, a biomarker for a sensitive and simple diagnostic test and highly effective target therapy of CRC is still clinically unavailable. This study is to investigate the evidence and significance of plasma GPC1 positive exosomes as a biomarker of CRC. Results showed that GPC1+ exosomes were successfully isolated from tissues and plasma. The percentage of GPC1+ exosomes and the GPC1 protein expression in exosomes from tumour tissues and plasma of CRC patients before surgical treatment was significantly elevated compared to that in the peritumoural tissues and the plasma of healthy controls. miR-96-5p and miR-149 expression in tumour tissues and plasma of CRC patients as well as in the GPC1+ exosomes from CRC patients were significantly decreased compared to that in the peritumoural tissues and the plasma of healthy controls. Two months after surgical treatment, levels of all tested markers significantly normalized. Overexpression of miR-96-5p and miR-149 significantly decreased GPC1 expression in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells, xenograft tumours, plasma in mice bearing HT-29 and HCT-116 tumours, and the secretion of GPC1+ exosomes from the HT-29 and HCT-116 cells and xenograft tumours. Overexpression of miR-96-5p and miR-149 significantly decreased cell viability and increased cell apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells, and inhibited the growth of xenograft HT-29 and HCT-116 tumours. In conclusion, the increased plasma GPC1+ exosomes and reduced plasma miR-96-5p and miR-149 expression are specific markers for the diagnosis of CRC and targets for the therapy of CRC.	PMC5387162

Circ Res	2017	RATIONALE: Paracrine secretions seem to mediate therapeutic effects of human CD34+ stem cells locally transplanted in patients with myocardial and critical limb ischemia and in animal models. Earlier, we had discovered that paracrine secretion from human CD34+ cells contains proangiogenic, membrane-bound nanovesicles called exosomes (CD34Exo). OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated the mechanisms of CD34Exo-mediated ischemic tissue repair and therapeutic angiogenesis by studying their miRNA content and uptake. METHODS AND RESULTS: When injected into mouse ischemic hindlimb tissue, CD34Exo, but not the CD34Exo-depleted conditioned media, mimicked the beneficial activity of their parent cells by improving ischemic limb perfusion, capillary density, motor function, and their amputation. CD34Exo were found to be enriched with proangiogenic miRNAs such as miR-126-3p. Knocking down miR-126-3p from CD34Exo abolished their angiogenic activity and beneficial function both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, injection of CD34Exo increased miR-126-3p levels in mouse ischemic limb but did not affect the endogenous synthesis of miR-126-3p, suggesting a direct transfer of stable and functional exosomal miR-126-3p. miR-126-3p enhanced angiogenesis by suppressing the expression of its known target, SPRED1, simultaneously modulating the expression of genes involved in angiogenic pathways such as VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), ANG1 (angiopoietin 1), ANG2 (angiopoietin 2), MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9), TSP1 (thrombospondin 1), etc. Interestingly, CD34Exo, when treated to ischemic hindlimbs, were most efficiently internalized by endothelial cells relative to smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, demonstrating a direct role of stem cell-derived exosomes on mouse endothelium at the cellular level. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results have demonstrated a novel mechanism by which cell-free CD34Exo mediates ischemic tissue repair via beneficial angiogenesis. Exosome-shuttled proangiogenic miRNAs may signify amplification of stem cell function and may explain the angiogenic and therapeutic benefits associated with CD34+ stem cell therapy.	PMC5420547

Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α Potentiates Jagged 1-Mediated Angiogenesis by Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes.	Stem Cells	2017	Insufficient vessel growth associated with ischemia remains an unresolved issue in vascular medicine. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to promote angiogenesis via a mechanism that is potentiated by hypoxia. Overexpression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α in MSCs improves their therapeutic potential by inducing angiogenesis in transplanted tissues. Here, we studied the contribution of exosomes released by HIF-1α-overexpressing donor MSCs (HIF-MSC) to angiogenesis by endothelial cells. Exosome secretion was enhanced in HIF-MSC. Omics analysis of miRNAs and proteins incorporated into exosomes pointed to the Notch pathway as a candidate mediator of exosome communication. Interestingly, we found that Jagged1 was the sole Notch ligand packaged into MSC exosomes and was more abundant in HIF-MSC than in MSC controls. The addition of Jagged1-containing exosomes from MSC and HIF-MSC cultures to endothelial cells triggered transcriptional changes in Notch target genes and induced angiogenesis in an in vitro model of capillary-like tube formation, and both processes were stimulated by HIF-1α. Finally, subcutaneous injection of Jagged 1-containing exosomes from MSC and HIF-MSC cultures in the Matrigel plug assay induced angiogenesis in vivo, which was more robust when they were derived from HIF-MSC cultures. All Jagged1-mediated effects could be blocked by prior incubation of exosomes with an anti-Jagged 1 antibody. All together, the results indicate that exosomes derived from MSCs stably overexpressing HIF-1α have an increased angiogenic capacity in part via an increase in the packaging of Jagged1, which could have potential applications for the treatment of ischemia-related disease.

Neurons secrete miR-132-containing exosomes to regulate brain vascular integrity.	Cell Res	2017	Vascular integrity helps maintain brain microenvironment homeostasis, which is critical for the normal development and function of the central nervous system. It is known that neural cells can regulate brain vascular integrity. However, due to the high complexity of neurovascular interactions involved, understanding of the neural regulation of brain vascular integrity is still rudimentary. Using intact zebrafish larvae and cultured rodent brain cells, we find that neurons transfer miR-132, a highly conserved and neuron-enriched microRNA, via secreting exosomes to endothelial cells (ECs) to maintain brain vascular integrity. Following translocation to ECs through exosome internalization, miR-132 regulates the expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), an important adherens junction protein, by directly targeting eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eef2k). Disruption of neuronal miR-132 expression or exosome secretion, or overexpression of vascular eef2k impairs VE-cadherin expression and brain vascular integrity. Our study indicates that miR-132 acts as an intercellular signal mediating neural regulation of the brain vascular integrity and suggests that the neuronal exosome is a novel avenue for neurovascular communication.

Cell Mol Life Sci	2017	OBJECTIVE: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are subcellular signalosomes. Although characteristic EV production is associated with numerous physiological and pathological conditions, the effect of blood-derived EVs on bone homeostasis is unknown. Herein we evaluated the role of circulating EVs on human osteoclastogenesis. METHODS: Blood samples from healthy volunteers, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients were collected. Size-based EV sub-fractions were isolated by gravity-driven filtration and differential centrifugation. To investigate the properties of EV samples, resistive pulse sensing technique, transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry and western blot were performed. CD14+ monocytes were separated from PBMCs, and stimulated with recombinant human M-CSF, RANKL and blood-derived EV sub-fractions. After 7 days, the cells were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and counted. RESULTS: EVs isolated by size-based sub-fractions were characterized as either microvesicles or exosomes (EXO). Healthy (n = 11) and RA-derived (n = 12) EXOs profoundly inhibited osteoclast differentiation (70%, p < 0.01; 65%, p < 0.01, respectively). In contrast, PsA-derived (n = 10) EXOs had a stimulatory effect (75%, p < 0.05). In cross-treatment experiments where EXOs and CD14+ cells were interchanged between the three groups, only healthy (n = 5) and RA (n = 5)-derived EXOs inhibited (p < 0.01, respectively) the generation of osteoclasts in all groups, whereas PsA (n = 7)-derived EXOs were unable to mediate this effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that blood-derived EXOs are novel regulators of the human osteoclastogenesis and may offer discrete effector function in distinct inflammatory arthropathies.

Exosomes Derived from Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Relieve Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Mice.	Biomed Res Int	2017	Exosomes secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown repairing effects on several tissue injury diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of exosomes released from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) on the treatment of dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to explore the underlying mechanism. We found that indocyanine green (ICG) labeled exosomes homed to colon tissues of IBD mice at 12 hours after injection. Exosomes significantly relieved the severity of IBD in mice as hucMSCs. The expression of IL-10 gene was increased while that of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, and IL-7 genes was decreased in the colon tissues and spleens of exosomes-treated mice. Furthermore, the infiltration of macrophages into the colon tissues was decreased by exosome treatment in IBD mice. In addition, we provided evidence that in vitro coculture with exosomes inhibited the expression of iNOS and IL-7 in mouse enterocoelia macrophages. Moreover, we found that the expression of IL-7 was higher in the colon tissues of colitis patients than that of healthy controls. Our findings suggest that exosomes from hucMSCs have profound effects on alleviating DSS-induced IBD and may exert their impact through the modulation of IL-7 expression in macrophages.	PMC5447283

Mol Nutr Food Res	2017	SCOPE: Breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of infection, immune-mediated disorders, obesity, and even cancer. Recently it was found that breast milk contains a variety of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the skim and fat layer that can be transferred to infants, and appear to play important roles in those biological functions. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study applied next generation sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analysis to determine the miRNA expression profile of the skim and fat fraction of human, goat, and bovine milk as well as infant formulas. Human and mammalian milk were found to contain known advantageous miRNAs in exosomes and also in the fat layer. These miRNAs are highly conserved in human, bovine and goat milk. However, they were not detected in several infant formulas. Further, miRNAs present in milk were able to enter normal and tumor cells and affect their biological functions. Following incubation of milk derived human miRNA with normal and cancer cells, the expression of miRNA-148a was upregulated and the expression of the DNA methyltransferase1 target gene of miRNA-148a was down regulated. CONCLUSION: These results reinforce previous findings on the importance of miRNA in breast milk. Future studies should concentrate on the addition of miRNA to infant formulas.

Antitumor HPV E7-specific CTL activity elicited by in vivo engineered exosomes produced through DNA inoculation.	Int J Nanomedicine	2017	We recently proved that exosomes engineered in vitro to deliver high amounts of HPV E7 upon fusion with the Nefmut exosome-anchoring protein elicit an efficient anti-E7 cytotoxic T lymphocyte immune response. However, in view of a potential clinic application of this finding, our exosome-based immunization strategy was faced with possible technical difficulties including industrial manufacturing, cost of production, and storage. To overcome these hurdles, we designed an as yet unproven exosome-based immunization strategy relying on delivery by intramuscular inoculation of a DNA vector expressing Nefmut fused with HPV E7. In this way, we predicted that the expression of the Nefmut/E7 vector in muscle cells would result in a continuous source of endogenous (ie, produced by the inoculated host) engineered exosomes able to induce an E7-specific immune response. To assess this hypothesis, we first demonstrated that the injection of a Nefmut/green fluorescent protein-expressing vector led to the release of fluorescent exosomes, as detected in plasma of inoculated mice. Then, we observed that mice inoculated intramuscularly with a vector expressing Nefmut/E7 developed a CD8+ T-cell immune response against both Nef and E7. Conversely, no CD8+ T-cell responses were detected upon injection of vectors expressing either the wild-type Nef isoform of E7 alone, most likely a consequence of their inefficient exosome incorporation. The production of immunogenic exosomes in the DNA-injected mice was formally demonstrated by the E7-specific CD8+ T-cell immune response we detected in mice inoculated with exosomes isolated from plasma of mice inoculated with the Nefmut/E7 vector. Finally, we provide evidence that the injection of Nefmut/E7 DNA led to the generation of effective antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes whose activity was likely part of the potent, therapeutic antitumor effect we observed in mice implanted with TC-1 tumor cells. In summary, we established a novel method to generate immunogenic exosomes in vivo by the intramuscular inoculation of DNA vectors expressing the exosome-anchoring protein Nefmut and its derivatives.

Chemically Edited Exosomes with Dual Ligand Purified by Microfluidic Device for Active Targeted Drug Delivery to Tumor Cells.	ACS Appl Mater Interfaces	2017	Exosomes, which are lipid membrane-bound nanovesicles (50-150 nm in diameter), have aroused extensive attention for their potential applications in invasive molecular and stand for a new therapeutic delivery system. However, they are limited by poor targeting ability and a lack of efficient isolation techniques. Here, we present a three-dimensional nanostructured microfluidic chip, in which arrays of micropillars were functionalized with crisscrossed multiwall carbon nanotubes by chemical deposition, to capture exosomes with high efficiency through a combination of a specific recognition molecule (CD63) and the unique topography of the nanomaterials. As is proven, this nanostructured interface substantially made the immuno capturing of exosomes more efficient. A high percentage of intact vesicles <150 nm were readily purified. As a further application, we added functionality to the exosomes by a chemical editing approach for targeted drug delivery. Donor cells were labeled chemically with dual ligands (biotin and avidin) in the phospholipid membrane and encapsulated drugs in the cytosol. Though the engineered donor cells secreted exosomes, the dual ligands, together with the drugs, were inherited by the exosomes, which were then isolated with the microfluidic chip. Then, the isolated exosomes were used as drug delivery vehicles and showed strong targeting abilities to tumor cells and highly efficient receptor-mediated cellular uptake when exposed to recipient cells. Thus, the anticancer effect of chemotherapeutic drugs was improved significantly. It suggested that this platform could provide a useful tool for isolating intact exosomes with high efficiency and exploiting their natural carrier function to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs to tumor cells with increased efficacy and targeting capacity.

Methods Mol Biol	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently attracted substantial attention due to the potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. Although a variety of techniques have been used to isolate and analyze EVs, it is still far away from satisfaction. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), which separates subjects by size, has been widely applied in protein purification and analysis. The purpose of this chapter is to show the applications of size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as methods for EV characterization of impurities or contaminants of small size, and thus for quality assay for the purity of the samples of EVs.

Selective release of miRNAs via extracellular vesicles is associated with house-dust mite allergen-induced airway inflammation.	Clin Exp Allergy	2017	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may facilitate cell-to-cell communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs). The biological roles of miRNAs in EVs on allergic airway inflammation are unclear. METHODS: Airway-secreted EVs (AEVs) were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of control and house-dust mite (HDM) allergen-exposed HDM-sensitized mice. The expression of miRNAs in AEVs or miRNAs and mRNAs in lung tissue was analysed using miRNA microarray. RESULTS: The amount of AEV increased 8.9-fold in BALF from HDM-exposed mice compared with that from sham-control mice. HDM exposure resulted in significant changes in the expression of 139 miRNAs in EVs and 175 miRNAs in lung tissues, with 54 miRNAs being common in both samples. Expression changes of these 54 miRNAs between miRNAs in AEVs and lung tissues after HDM exposure were inversely correlated. Computational analysis revealed that 31 genes, including IL-13 and IL-5Ra, are putative targets of the miRNAs up-regulated in AEVs but down-regulated in lung tissues after HDM exposure. The amount of AEV in BALF after HDM exposure was diminished by treatment with the sphingomyelinase inhibitor GW4869. The treatment with GW4869 also decreased Th2 cytokines and eosinophil counts in BALFs and reduced eosinophil accumulation in airway walls and mucosa. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that selective sorting of miRNA including Th2 inhibitory miRNAs into AEVs and increase release to the airway after HDM exposure would be involved in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation.

Human tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) regulate Treg functions via cell surface signaling rather than uptake mechanisms.	Oncoimmunology	2017	Tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) are ubiquitously present in the tumor microenvironment and plasma of cancer patients. TEX carry a cargo of multiple stimulatory and inhibitory molecules and deliver them to recipient cells, serving as a communication network for the tumor. The mechanisms TEX use for delivering messages to recipient cells were evaluated using PKH26-labeled TEX produced by cultured human tumor cells, exosomes produced by dendritic cells-derived exosomes (DEX), or exosomes isolated from plasma of cancer patients (EXO). Human T-cell subsets, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes were co-incubated with TEX, DEX, or EXO and binding or internalization of labeled vesicles was evaluated by confocal microscopy and/or Amnis-based flow cytometry. Vesicle-induced Ca2+ influx in recipient T cells was monitored, and TEX-induced inosine production in Treg was determined by mass spectrometry. In contrast to B cells, NK cells or monocytes, conventional T cells did not internalize labeled vesicles. Minimal exosome uptake was only evident in Treg following prolonged co-incubation with TEX. All exosomes induced Ca2+ influx in T cells, with TEX and EXO isolated from cancer patients' plasma delivering the strongest, sustained signaling to Treg. Such sustained signaling resulted in the significant upregulation of the conversion of extracellular ATP to inosine (adenosine metabolite) by Treg, suggesting that TEX signaling could have functional consequences in these recipient cells. Thus, modulation of Treg suppressor functions by TEX is mediated by mechanisms dependent on cell surface signaling and does not require TEX internalization by recipient cells.	PMC5593709

Exosomes derived from hypoxia-preconditioned mesenchymal stromal cells ameliorate cognitive decline by rescuing synaptic dysfunction and regulating inflammatory responses in APP/PS1 mice.	FASEB J	2018	Administration of exosomes derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) could improve some neurologic conditions by transferring functional biomolecules to recipient cells. Furthermore, exosomes from hypoxic progenitor cells exerted better therapeutic effects in organ injury through specific cargoes. However, there are no related reports about whether exosomes derived from MSCs or hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs (PC-MSCs) could prevent memory deficits in Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, the exosomes derived from MSCs or PC-MSCs were systemically administered to transgenic APP/PS1 mice. The expression of miR-21 in MSCs was significantly increased after hypoxic treatment. Injection of exosomes from normoxic MSCs could rescue cognition and memory impairment according to results of the Morris water maze test, reduced plaque deposition, and Aβ levels in the brain; could decrease the activation of astrocytes and microglia; could down-regulate proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β); and could up-regulate anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and -10) in AD mice, as well as reduce the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and NF-κB. Compared to the group administered exosomes from normoxic MSCs, in the group administered exosomes from PC-MSCs, learning and memory capabilities were significantly improved; the plaque deposition and Aβ levels were lower, and expression of growth-associated protein 43, synapsin 1, and IL-10 was increased; and the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1, TNF-α, IL-1β, and activation of STAT3 and NF-κB were sharply decreased. More importantly, exosomes from PC-MSCs effectively increased the level of miR-21 in the brain of AD mice. Additionally, replenishment of miR-21 restored the cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice and prevented pathologic features. Taken together, these findings suggest that exosomes from PC-MSCs could improve the learning and memory capabilities of APP/PS1 mice, and that the underlying mechanism may lie in the restoration of synaptic dysfunction and regulation of inflammatory responses through regulation of miR-21.-Cui, G.-H., Wu, J., Mou, F.-F., Xie, W.-H., Wang, F.-B., Wang, Q.-L., Fang, J., Xu, Y.-W., Dong, Y.-R., Liu, J.-R., Guo, H.-D.

Enzymes	2017	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles of endocytic origin that are secreted by most cells and detected in saliva. Pathophysiological roles for salivary exosomes are beginning to be recognized in diseases including cancer, highlighting potential biomarkers and biological functions. Since early detection of cancer is vital for successful treatment, salivary exosomes would be advantageous in achieving a better survival rate due to their ready availability and noninvasiveness. The use of salivary exosomes may therefore be promising in the accurate detection of premalignant lesions and early-stage cancers, also for better our understanding of the molecular basis of tumorigenesis. In this chapter, we review our current knowledge of salivaomics, focusing on nucleic acids and proteins in saliva as potential cancer biomarkers. Since salivaomics is a rapidly evolving field, we hope to expand frameworks toward salivary exosomes, integrate new and existing information, and bridge salivaomics with other biomedical researches. Furthermore, we would like to coin the term "saliva-exosomics" as the next-generation salivaomics. Our goal in this chapter is to provide the most updated information on cancer-derived exosomes in the saliva as natural carriers of biomarkers and signaling molecules. Major advances include definitive structure analysis and molecular characterization of salivary exosomes. We also highlight the exosome biogenesis and cargo trafficking mechanisms in which recent animal studies have expanded our understanding of exosome-mediated transfer of cancer-derived products from distal tumor to salivary gland. The potential roles of the salivary exosomes in cancer progression and immune surveillance are also addressed.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 priming of tumour-derived exosomes enhances the antitumour immune response.	Br J Cancer	2018	BACKGROUND: Tumour-derived exosomes (TEXs) have a potential for application in cancer vaccines. Whether TEXs after induction by interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) are capable of enhancing the antitumour response remains to be determined. METHODS: Exosomes released by tumour cells infected with IRF-1-expressing adenovirus (IRF-1-Exo) or treated with interferon-γ (IFN-Exo) were isolated via ultracentrifugation. The IRF-1 target proteins IL-15Rα and MHC class I (MHC-I) were analysed by western blot. Exosomes along with CpG adjuvant were injected into tumour models to assess the antitumour effects. Tumours were harvested for immunofluorescence staining. Splenocytes from tumour-bearing mice were co-cultured with tumour cells. The IFNγ-positive and granzyme B-positive CD8α+ splenocyte cells were quantified by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The IRF-1-Exo or IFN-Exo displayed increased IL-15Rα and MHC-I expression. Injection of IRF-1-Exo or IFN-Exo combined with CpG had improved antitumour effects in mice. This effect may be a result of increased infiltration of tumours by CD4+ and CD8α+ T cells. Antibody-mediated depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells abrogated the antitumour effects. Splenocytes isolated from CpG+IRF-1-Exo-injected Hepa 1-6 tumour mice had increased IFNγ-positive and granzyme B-positive CD8+ cells after co-culturing with Hepa 1-6 cells as compared with MC38 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The IRF-1 priming of TEXs enhances antitumour immune response.	PMC5765230

GMSC-Derived Exosomes Combined with a Chitosan/Silk Hydrogel Sponge Accelerates Wound Healing in a Diabetic Rat Skin Defect Model.	Front Physiol	2017	Background: Delayed wound healing in diabetic patients is one of the most challenging complications in clinical medicine, as it poses a greater risk of gangrene, amputation and even death. Therefore, a novel method to promote diabetic wound healing is of considerable interest at present. Previous studies showed that injection of MSC-derived exosomes has beneficial effects on wound healing. In current studies, we aimed to isolate exosomes derived from gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) and then loading them to the chitosan/silk hydrogel sponge to evaluate the effects of this novel non-invasive method on skin defects in diabetic rats. Methods: GMSCs were isolated from human gingival connective tissue and characterized by surface antigen analysis and in vitro multipotent differentiation. The cell supernatant was collected to isolate the exosomes. The exosomes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Western blot and size distribution analysis. The chitosan/silk-based hydrogel sponge was prepared using the freeze-drying method and then structural and physical properties were characterized. Then, the exosomes were added to the hydrogel and tested in a diabetic rat skin defect model. The effects were evaluated by wound area measurement, histological, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis. Results: We have successfully isolated GMSCs and exosomes with a mean diameter of 127 nm. The chitosan/silk hydrogel had the appropriate properties of swelling and moisture retention capacity. The in vivo studies showed that the incorporating of GMSC-derived exosomes to hydrogel could effectively promote healing of diabetic skin defects. The histological analysis revealed more neo-epithelium and collagen in the hydrogel-exosome group. In addition, the hydrogel-exosome group had the highest microvessel density and nerve density. Conclusions: The combination of GMSC-derived exosomes and hydrogel could effectively promote skin wound healing in diabetic rats by promoting the re-epithelialization, deposition and remodeling of collagen and by enhancing angiogenesis and neuronal ingrowth. These findings not only provide new information on the role of the GMSC-derived exosomes in wound healing but also provide a novel non-invasive application method of exosomes with practical value for skin repair.

Exosomal miR-141-3p regulates osteoblast activity to promote the osteoblastic metastasis of prostate cancer.	Oncotarget	2017	Exosomes from cancer cells, which contain microRNA and reach metastasis loci prior to cancer cells, stimulate the formation of a metastatic microenvironment. Previous studies have shown that exosomal miR-141-3p is associated with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). However, the role and regulatory mechanism of miR-141-3p in the microenvironment of bone metastases require further study. In this study, we performed a series of experiments in vivo and in vitro to determine whether exosomal miR-141-3p from MDA PCa 2b cells regulates osteoblast activity to promote osteoblastic metastasis. We demonstrate that extracts obtained from cell culture supernatants contained exosomes and that miR-141-3p levels were significantly higher in MDA PCa 2b cell exosomes. Via confocal imaging, numerous MDA PCa 2b exosomes were observed to enter osteoblasts, and miR-141-3p was transferred to osteoblasts through MDA PCa 2b exosomes in vitro. Exosomal miR-141-3p from MDA PCa 2b promoted osteoblast activity and increased osteoprotegerin OPG expression. miR-141-3p suppressed the protein levels of the target gene DLC1, indicating its functional significance in activating the p38MAPK pathway. In animal experiments, exosomal miR-141-3p had bone-target specificity and promoted osteoblast activity. Mice injected with miR-141-3p-mimics exosomes developed apparent osteoblastic bone metastasis. Exosomal miR-141-3p from MDA PCa 2b cells promoted osteoblast activity and regulated the microenvironment of bone metastases, which plays an important role in the formation of bone metastases and osteogenesis damage in PCa. Clarifying the specific mechanism of bone metastasis will help generate new possibilities for the treatment of PCa.	PMC5706916

Oral Oncol	2018	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of oral cancer-derived exosomes (OCEXs) on natural killer (NK) cells and to explore the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OCEXs were isolated from the cell culture supernatant of oral cancer (OC) cells using ultrafiltration and affinity chromatography and were identified using electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting. The effects of OCEXs on NK cells were analyzed using laser scanning confocal microscopy and several functional assays of NK cells. To explore the mechanism of their effects, antibody array, protein mass spectrometry and RNA interference were adopted. RESULTS: The particles isolated from the OC cells were identified as exosomes with satisfactory morphology, concentration and purity. The OCEXs were internalized by NK cells and then promoted the biological functions of NK cells, including proliferation, release of perforin and granzyme M and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, OCEXs increased the expression of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and its phosphorylation, which drove the expression of the type I interferon (IFN) gene and the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) genes, thereby promoting the functions of NK cells. In addition, NF-κB-activating kinase-associated protein 1 (NAP1), an upstream activator of IRF-3, was enriched in OCEXs, and treatment with OCEXs increased the expression of NAP1 in NK cells. Importantly, NAP1-depleted OCEXs obtained from OC cells had a dramatically weakened influence on NK cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized function of exosomal NAP1 derived from OC cells in enhancing the cytotoxicity of NK cells via the IRF-3 pathway.

Exosomes derived from oxidized LDL-stimulated macrophages attenuate the growth and tube formation of endothelial cells.	Mol Med Rep	2018	Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) has a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis. The participation of oxLDL‑stimulated macrophages has been well‑established in atherosclerosis, however the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Macrophage‑derived exosomes are actively released and are involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. However, the function of exosomes secreted by oxLDL‑stimulated macrophages in atherosclerosis remains unknown. Exosomes from oxLDL‑treated macrophages and controls were co‑cultured with endothelial cells and the exosomes were taken up by endocytosis. Cell Counting Kit‑8 and tube formation assay results revealed that exosomes derived from oxLDL‑stimulated macrophages reduced the growth and tube formation ability of endothelial cells. Suppression of exosomal secretion by oxLDL‑stimulated macrophages rescued the growth and tube formation ability of endothelial cells. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that oxLDL‑stimulated macrophages may attenuate the growth and tube formation of endothelial cells, at least in part through exosomal transfer. This may provide novel targets for the development of atherosclerosis therapeutics.

Methods Mol Biol	2018	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted nanoscale particles that transfer biomolecular cargo between cells in multicellular organisms. EVs play a variety of roles in intercellular communication and are being explored as potential vehicles for delivery of therapeutic biomolecules. However, EVs are highly heterogeneous in composition and biogenesis route, and this poses substantial challenges for understanding the role of EVs in biology and for harnessing these mechanisms for therapeutic applications, for which purifying therapeutic EVs from mixed EV populations may be necessary. Currently, technologies for isolating EV subsets are limited by overlapping physical properties among EV subsets. To meet this need, here we report an affinity chromatography-based method for enriching a specific EV subset from a heterogeneous EV starting population. By displaying an affinity tagged protein (tag-protein) on the EV surface, tagged EVs may be specifically isolated using simple affinity chromatography. Moreover, recovered EVs are enriched in the tag-protein relative to the starting population of EVs and relative to EVs purified from cell culture supernatant by standard differential centrifugation. Furthermore, chromatographically enriched EVs confer enhanced delivery of a cargo protein to recipient cells (via enhancing the amount of cargo protein per EV) relative to EVs isolated by centrifugation. Altogether, affinity chromatographic enrichment of EV subsets is a viable and facile strategy for investigating EV biology and for harnessing EVs for therapeutic applications.	
29434051		Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI)			Downregulation of exosomal miR-204-5p and miR-632 as a biomarker for FTD: a GENFI study.	J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry	2018	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can serve as diagnostic biomarkers, we assessed miRNA expression in the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative (GENFI) cohort and in sporadic FTD. METHODS: GENFI participants were either carriers of a pathogenic mutation in progranulin, chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 or microtubule-associated protein tau or were at risk of carrying a mutation because a first-degree relative was a known symptomatic mutation carrier. Exosomes were isolated from CSF of 23 presymptomatic and 15 symptomatic mutation carriers and 11 healthy non-mutation carriers. Expression of 752 miRNAs was measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR) arrays and validated by qPCR using individual primers. MiRNAs found differentially expressed in symptomatic compared with presymptomatic mutation carriers were further evaluated in a cohort of 17 patients with sporadic FTD, 13 patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 10 healthy controls (HCs) of similar age. RESULTS: In the GENFI cohort, miR-204-5p and miR-632 were significantly decreased in symptomatic compared with presymptomatic mutation carriers. Decrease of miR-204-5p and miR-632 revealed receiver operator characteristics with an area of 0.89 (90% CI 0.79 to 0.98) and 0.81 (90% CI 0.68 to 0.93), respectively, and when combined an area of 0.93 (90% CI 0.87 to 0.99). In sporadic FTD, only miR-632 was significantly decreased compared with AD and HCs. Decrease of miR-632 revealed an area of 0.90 (90% CI 0.81 to 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Exosomal miR-204-5p and miR-632 have potential as diagnostic biomarkers for genetic FTD and miR-632 also for sporadic FTD.

Leukemia	2018	Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are responsible for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) chemotherapy resistance and relapse. Here, we discovered that miR-34c-5p, a microRNA central to the senescence regulation network, was significantly down-regulated in AML (non-acute promyelocytic leukemia, non-APL) stem cells compared to that in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The lower expression of miR-34c-5p in LSCs was closely correlated to the adverse prognosis and poor responses to therapy of AML patients. Increased miR-34c-5p expression induced LSCs senescence ex vivo, prevented leukemia development and promoted the eradication of LSCs in immune deficient mice. Mechanistically, forced expression of miR-34-5p induced senescence in LSCs through p53-p21Cip1-Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/Cyclin or p53-independent CDK/Cyclin pathways. Exosome-mediated transfer of miR-34c-5p was one of the reasons for miR-34c-5p deficiency in LSCs. Furthermore, miR-34c-5p could increase its intracellular level by inhibiting exosome-mediated transfer via a positive feedback loop through RAB27B, a molecule that promotes exosome shedding. Overall, this study establishes a new strategy for treatment of AML patients by targeting LSCs to reinitiate senescence via increased miR-34c-5p expression. This miRNA-mediated tumor stem cell senescence could also have important therapeutic value in other malignancies.

Effects of Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Exosomes on Corneal Stromal Fibroblast Viability and Extracellular Matrix Synthesis.	Chin Med J (Engl)	2018	Background: Corneal stromal cells (CSCs) are components of the corneal endothelial microenvironment that can be induced to form a functional tissue-engineered corneal endothelium. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) have been reported as an important component of regenerative medicine and cell therapy for corneal stromal damage. We have demonstrated that the treatment with ADSCs leads to phenotypic changes in CSCs in vitro. However, the underlying mechanisms of such ADSC-induced changes in CSCs remain unclear. Methods: ADSCs and CSCs were isolated from New Zealand white rabbits and cultured in vitro. An Exosome Isolation Kit, Western blotting, and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) were used to isolate and confirm the exosomes from ADSC culture medium. Meanwhile, the optimal exosome concentration and treatment time were selected. Cell Counting Kit-8 and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide assays were used to assess the effect of ADSC- derived exosomes on the proliferation and apoptosis of CSCs. To evaluate the effects of ADSC- derived exosomes on CSC invasion activity, Western blotting was used to detect the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and collagens. Results:: ADSCs and CSCs were successfully isolated from New Zealand rabbits. The optimal concentration and treatment time of exosomes for the following study were 100 μg/ml and 96 h, respectively. NTA revealed that the ADSC-derived exosomes appeared as nanoparticles (40-200 nm), and Western blotting confirmed positive expression of CD9, CD81, flotillin-1, and HSP70 versus ADSC cytoplasmic proteins (all P < 0.01). ADSC-derived exosomes (50 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml) significantly promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis (mainly early apoptosis) of CSCs versus non-exosome-treated CSCs (all P < 0.05). Interestingly, MMPs were downregulated and extracellular matrix (ECM)-related proteins including collagens and fibronectin were upregulated in the exosome-treated CSCs versus non-exosome-treated CSCs (MMP1: t = 80.103, P < 0.01; MMP2: t = 114.778, P < 0.01; MMP3: t = 56.208, P < 0.01; and MMP9: t = 60.617, P < 0.01; collagen I: t = -82.742, P < 0.01; collagen II: t = -72.818, P < 0.01; collagen III: t = -104.452, P < 0.01; collagen IV: t = -133.426, P < 0.01, and collagen V: t = -294.019, P < 0.01; and fibronectin: t = -92.491, P < 0.01, respectively). Conclusion:: The findings indicate that ADSCs might play an important role in CSC viability regulation and ECM remodeling, partially through the secretion of exosomes.	PMC5865317

J Cardiovasc Transl Res	2018	The role and miRNA expression profile of exosomes in hypertension remain largely unknown. Therefore, next-generation sequencing was used to define the miRNA expression profile of plasma exosomes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), the most widely used animal model of human essential hypertension, and their controls, normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs). Results revealed that percentages of miRNA in the total small RNA isolated from SHRs and WKYs were not significantly different. Twenty-seven miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (DE) between SHR and WKY exosomes, including 23 up-regulated and four down-regulated in SHR exosomes as compared to WKY exosomes. Gene Ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of top 10 DE miRNAs identified hypertension-specific target genes/signaling pathways. In conclusion, our findings indicated the selective packing of miRNA cargo into exosomes under hypertensive status, which could facilitate the development of potential targets for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of hypertension.	
29621784	Lianbao Kong				Exosomes Derived from Dendritic Cells Attenuate Liver Injury by Modulating the Balance of Treg and Th17 Cells After Ischemia Reperfusion.	Cell Physiol Biochem	2018	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The present study aimed to evaluate the effects as well as the underlying mechanisms of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and exosomes produced by BMDCs (DEXs) on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury (IRI). METHODS: Primary hepatocytes were isolated and used to mimic the liver IR microenvironment. BMDCs were induced and characterized both biochemically with a flow cytometer (FCM) and biophysically with a microscope. Then, we exposed BMDCs to the supernatants from primary hepatocytes and evaluated the maturation of BMDCs by FCM. BMDCs were systemically injected into mice before liver IR via the tail vein, and the therapeutic effects were evaluated. The serum levels of transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), inflammatory cytokines, and histological changes were respectively examined by ELISA, RT-qPCR and microscopy. Furthermore, we isolated DEXs by ultracentrifugation, characterized DEXs by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanosight tracking analysis (NTA) and western blotting (WB), and then we co-cultured BMDCs/DEXs and naïve T cells and performed FCM, ELISA and confocal imaging. Moreover, we injected DEXs into mice prior to liver IR via the tail vein and examined its therapeutic effects by microscopy and ELISA. Finally, inhibitors of HSP70 (cmHSP70.1), PI3K (BKM120) and mTOR (Rapamycin) were used to investigate the role of HSP70 and the PI3K/mTOR axis in the effects of DEXs on naïve T cells by WB and FCM. RESULTS: Bone marrow cells were efficiently induced into dendritic cells (DCs) with typical DC characteristics. The supernatants from primary hepatocytes exposed to H/R upregulated DC maturation markers. After DC administration, liver IR injury was improved with histopathological scores and serum transaminases. Additionally, we found that the anti-inflammatory cytokines TGF-β, Foxp3 and interleukin (IL)-10 were upregulated and that IL-17 was downregulated. Furthermore, confocal imaging revealed that the uptake of H/R-DEXs by naïve T cells was greater than that of DEXs derived from the control or negative group of BMDCs, and this increase was correlated with a significantly greater degree of differentiation of Tregs and Th17 cells. Moreover, H/R-DEXs administration improved liver function in mice after IR. Finally, the inhibition of HSP70, PI3K and mTOR completely abolished the effect of DEXs on naïve T cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that BMDCs and DEXs could alleviate hepatic I/R injury via modulating the balance between Tregs and Th17 cells. DEXs transported HSP70 into naïve T cells and stimulated the PI3K/mTOR axis to modulate the balance between Tregs and Th17 cells and protect the liver from IR injury.

Anal Bioanal Chem	2018	Circulating exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are valuable biomarker candidates; however, information on the characterization and mutual agreement of commercial kits for circulating exosomal miRNA profiling is scarce. Here, we analyzed the advantages and weaknesses of four commonly used commercial kits for exosomal miRNA profiling and their application to the sample of serum and/or plasma, respectively. NanoSight and Western blotting were conducted to evaluate the efficiency and purity of the isolated exosomes. In our conditions, the size distribution of the isolated particles was appropriate (40-150 nm), and ExoQuick™ Exosome Precipitation Solution (EXQ) generated a relatively high yield of exosomes. Nevertheless, albumin impurity was ubiquitous for all the four kits, and Total Exosome Isolation for serum or plasma (TEI) yielded a relatively pure isolation. We further performed Illumina sequencing combined with RT-qPCR to determine the ability of these kits for miRNA profiling. There was significant correlation of the exosomal miRNA profile and specific miRNAs between kits, but with differences depending on methods. exoRNeasy Serum/Plasma Midi Kit (EXR) and EXQ performed better in the specific exosomal miRNAs recovery. Intraassay CVs for specific miRNA measurement were 0.88-3.82, 1.19-3.77, 0-2.70, and 1.23-9.11% for EXR, TEI, EXQ, and RIBO™ Exosome Isolation Reagent (REI), respectively. In each kit, serum yielded a higher abundance of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs than plasma, yet with more albumin impurity. In conclusion, our data provide some valuable guidance for the methodology of disease biomarker identification of circulation exosomal miRNAs. Graphical abstract Circulating exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are valuable biomarker candidates; however, information on the characterization and mutual agreement of commercial kits for circulating exosomal miRNA profiling is scarce.

Oncogene	2018	While immunosuppressive environments mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been well documented in glioma patients, the mechanisms of MDSC development and activation have not been clearly defined. Here, we elucidated a role for glioma-derived exosomes (GDEs) in potentiating an MDSC pathway. We isolated normoxia-stimulated and hypoxia-stimulated GDEs and studied their MDSC induction abilities in vivo and in vitro. Analyses of spleen and bone marrow MDSC proportions (flow cytometry) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), arginase activity, nitric oxide (NO), T-cell proliferation and immunosuppressive cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-β, ELISA) levels were used to assess MDSC expansion and functional capacity. We also performed microRNA (miRNA) sequencing analysis of two types of GDEs to find miRNAs that potentially mediate the development and activation of MDSCs. GDE miRNA intracellular signaling in MDSCs was also studied. Hypoxia promoted the secretion of GDEs, and mouse MDSCs could uptake GDEs. Hypoxia-stimulated GDEs had a stronger ability to induce MDSCs than N-GDEs. The hypoxia-inducible expression of miR-10a and miR-21 in GDEs mediated GDE-induced MDSC expansion and activation by targeting RAR-related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Mice inoculated with miR-10a or miR-21 knockout glioma cells generated fewer MDSCs than those inoculated with normal glioma cells. These data elucidated a mechanism by which glioma cells influence the differentiation and activation of MDSCs via exosomes and demonstrated how local glioma hypoxia affects the entirety of tumor immune environments.

Thrombotic characteristics of extracellular vesicles derived from prostate cancer cells.	Prostate	2018	BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PC) patients in advanced stages of the disease have high risk of blood coagulation complications. The procoagulant molecule Tissue factor (TF), and the fibrinolysis inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 PAI-1 play important role in this complication. Extracellular vesicles (EV) shed from cancer cells may contribute to the regulation of TF and PAI-1. The procoagulant activity of EV can be associated with the oncogenic and metastatic characteristics of their cells. METHODS: We have expressed EGFRvIII in DU145 cells to assess the role of this oncogene in the procoagulant activity of EV. The intercellular exchange of TF via EV was assessed by downregulating its expression in DU145 cells using shRNA vector, and determining the transfer of TF via EV enriched with the protein. Two PC cell lines with different metastatic potential were used to assess the correlation between the procoagulant activity of EV and the metastatic potential of PC cells. Photometric assays were used to determine FXa-activity and thrombin generation as indicators for the procoagulant activity of EV. Double-tagged proteinase-activated receptor 1(PAR-1) expressed in CHO cells to assess its activation by EV. RESULTS: The expression of EGFRvIII in DU145 cells led to increased mRNA levels for TF and PAI-1, but the increase in these proteins expression was detected mostly in the EV. EV with enhanced levels of TF protein conferred higher TF procoagulant activity on the acceptor cells by intercellular exchange of this protein. Procoagulant activity of EV, assessed by FXa activity, and thrombin generation, was correlated with the oncogenic and metastatic potential of PC cells. The ability of EV to generate thrombin led to the activation of PAR-1, which was evident by the truncation of tagged-PAR-1. CONCLUSION: The active oncogene EGFRvIII increases the concentration of TF and PAI-1 in EV. The procoagulant activity of EV is associated with the oncogenic and metastatic characteristics of their PC cells. Also, EV may contribute to the high procoagulant activity in the tumour microenvironment by the intercellular exchange of TF. Finally, through the generation of thrombin, EV can activate PAR-1, which evidently contributes to cancer progression, linking the coagulation system to tumor progression.

Cell Biol Int	2002	A subcellular fractionation procedure was developed to isolate the different endosomal compartments present during reticulocyte maturation. After reticulocyte lysis and removal of excess haemoglobin by gel chromatography, membrane vesicles were separated over a discontinuous sucrose gradient (10-40%). Two fractions were isolated: P1 at the 25-35% sucrose interface and P2 at the 17-25% sucrose interface. These fractions were morphologically characterized by electron microscopy and the distribution of endocytic markers in the fractions was detected by Western blot. Moreover, this fractionation technique was used to study the effect of 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor, on reticulocyte maturation. The presence of 3-MA during in vitro maturation of reticulocytes induced a decrease in exosome secretion, as measured by the amount of transferrin receptor (TfR) released in the extracellular medium. The subcellular fractionation results suggested that multivesicular endosome formation from early endosomes is the step affected by 3-MA.

ICAM-1 on exosomes from mature dendritic cells is critical for efficient naive T-cell priming.	Blood	2005	Exosomes are secreted vesicles formed in late endocytic compartments. Immature dendritic cells (DCs) secrete exosomes, which transfer functional major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complexes to other DCs. Since immature and mature DCs induce different functional T-cell responses (ie, tolerance versus priming), we asked whether DC maturation also influenced the priming abilities of their exosomes. We show that exosomes secreted by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mature DCs are 50- to 100-fold more potent to induce antigen-specific T-cell activation in vitro than exosomes from immature DCs. In vitro, exosomes from mature DCs transfer to B lymphocytes the ability to prime naive T cells. In vivo, only mature exosomes trigger effector T-cell responses, leading to fast skin graft rejection. Proteomic and biochemical analyses revealed that mature exosomes are enriched in MHC class II, B7.2, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and bear little milk-fat globule-epidermal growth factor-factor VIII (MFG-E8) as compared with immature exosomes. Functional analysis using DC-derived exosomes from knock-out mice showed that MHC class II and ICAM-1 are required for mature exosomes to prime naive T cells, whereas B7.2 and MFG-E8 are dispensable. Therefore, changes in protein composition and priming abilities of exosomes reflect the maturation signals received by DCs.

EMBO J	2006	Prion diseases are neurodegenerative disorders associated in most cases with the accumulation in the central nervous system of PrPSc (conformationally altered isoform of cellular prion protein (PrPC); Sc for scrapie), a partially protease-resistant isoform of the PrPC. PrPSc is thought to be the causative agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The mechanisms involved in the intercellular transfer of PrPSc are still enigmatic. Recently, small cellular vesicles of endosomal origin called exosomes have been proposed to contribute to the spread of prions in cell culture models. Retroviruses such as murine leukemia virus (MuLV) or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been shown to assemble and bud into detergent-resistant microdomains and into intracellular compartments such as late endosomes/multivesicular bodies. Here we report that moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) infection strongly enhances the release of scrapie infectivity in the supernatant of coinfected cells. Under these conditions, we found that PrPC, PrPSc and scrapie infectivity are recruited by both MuLV virions and exosomes. We propose that retroviruses can be important cofactors involved in the spread of the pathological prion agent.	PMC1500854

Redox-signaling transmitted in trans to neighboring cells by melanoma-derived TNF-containing exosomes.	Free Radic Biol Med	2007	Hydrogen peroxide is known to be involved in redox signaling pathways that regulate normal processes and disease progression, including cytokine signaling, oxidative stress, and cancer. In studies on immune surveillance against cancer, hydrogen peroxide was found to disrupt cytotoxic T-cell function, thus contributing to tumor escape. In this study, secretion of TNF-containing vesicles of rab9+ endosomal origin, termed exosomes, was investigated using GFP-TNF constructs. We observed a polarized intracellular trafficking and apical secretion of TNF-positive nanovesicles. Cell-to-cell transfer of TNF was observed in exosomes in real-time microscopy, occurring separate from the melanin/melanosome compartment. Exosomes were prepared by ultracentrifugation or immunoisolation on anti-beta2-microglobulin magnetic beads. TNF as well as TNF receptors 1 and 2 were present in the exosomes as determined by Western blot, flow cytometry, and deconvolution microscopy. The functional significance of melanoma-derived exosomes was established by their signaling competence with ability to generate significantly higher ROS levels in T cells compared with sham exosomes (P=0.0006). In conclusion, we report here, for the first time, that TNF is found in tumor cell-derived exosomes and that these exosomes transmit redox signaling in trans to neighboring cells. The results are of importance for a better understanding of tumor escape mechanisms.

Ceramide triggers budding of exosome vesicles into multivesicular endosomes.	Science	2008	Intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes are either sorted for cargo degradation into lysosomes or secreted as exosomes into the extracellular milieu. The mechanisms underlying the sorting of membrane into the different populations of intraluminal vesicles are unknown. Here, we find that cargo is segregated into distinct subdomains on the endosomal membrane and that the transfer of exosome-associated domains into the lumen of the endosome did not depend on the function of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery, but required the sphingolipid ceramide. Purified exosomes were enriched in ceramide, and the release of exosomes was reduced after the inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinases. These results establish a pathway in intraendosomal membrane transport and exosome formation.

Activated T cells recruit exosomes secreted by dendritic cells via LFA-1.	Blood	2009	Dendritic cells (DCs) are known to secrete exosomes that transfer membrane proteins, like major histocompatibility complex class II, to other DCs. Intercellular transfer of membrane proteins is also observed during cognate interactions between DCs and CD4(+) T cells. The acquired proteins are functional and play a role in regulation of immune responses. How membrane protein transfer is achieved and regulated is unclear. Here we show that T cells can recruit major histocompatibility complex class II-containing DC exosomes secreted in the extracellular milieu during cognate DC-T-cell interactions. Recruitment of these exosomes required T-cell activation and was dependent on leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) rather than on T-cell receptor specificity. Indeed, inducing a high-affinity state of LFA-1 on resting T cells was sufficient to provoke exosome binding. These results imply that DC exosomes secreted in the extracellular milieu during cognate T-cell-DC interactions are targeted to T cells activated in that microenvironment.

Human villous trophoblasts express and secrete placenta-specific microRNAs into maternal circulation via exosomes.	Biol Reprod	2009	In this study, we performed small RNA library sequencing using human placental tissues to identify placenta-specific miRNAs. We also tested the hypothesis that human chorionic villi could secrete miRNAs extracellularly via exosomes, which in turn enter into maternal circulation. By small RNA library sequencing, most placenta-specific miRNAs (e.g., MIR517A) were linked to a miRNA cluster on chromosome 19. The miRNA cluster genes were differentially expressed in placental development. Subsequent validation by real-time PCR and in situ hybridization revealed that villous trophoblasts express placenta-specific miRNAs. The analysis of small RNA libraries from the blood plasma showed that the placenta-specific miRNAs are abundant in the plasma of pregnant women. By real-time PCR, we confirmed the rapid clearance of the placenta-specific miRNAs from the plasma after delivery, indicating that such miRNAs enter into maternal circulation. By using the trophoblast cell line BeWo in culture, we demonstrated that miRNAs are indeed extracellularly released via exosomes. Taken together, our findings suggest that miRNAs are exported from the human placental syncytiotrophoblast into maternal circulation, where they could target maternal tissues. Finally, to address the biological functions of placenta-specific miRNAs, we performed a proteome analysis of BeWo cells transfected with MIR517A. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that this miRNA is possibly involved in tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling. Our data provide important insights into miRNA biology of the human placenta.

Inhibition of LINE-1 and Alu retrotransposition by exosomes encapsidating APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F.	Virology	2010	Human cytidine deaminases, including APOBEC3G (A3G) and A3F, are part of a cellular defense system against retroviruses and retroelements including non-LTR retrotransposons LINE-1 (L1) and Alu. Expression of cellular A3 proteins is sufficient for inhibition of L1 and Alu retrotransposition, but the effect of A3 proteins transferred in exosomes on retroelement mobilization is unknown. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that exosomes secreted by CD4(+)H9 T cells and mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells encapsidate A3G and A3F and inhibit L1 and Alu retrotransposition. A3G is the major contributor to the inhibitory activity of exosomes, however, the contribution of A3F in H9 exosomes cannot be excluded. Additionally, we show that exosomes encapsidate mRNAs coding for A3 proteins. A3G mRNA, and less so A3F, was enriched in exosomes secreted by H9 cells. Exosomal A3G mRNA was functional in vitro. Whether exosomes inhibit retrotransposons in vivo requires further investigation.	PMC2851184

Proteomic analysis identifies highly antigenic proteins in exosomes from M. tuberculosis-infected and culture filtrate protein-treated macrophages.	Proteomics	2010	Exosomes are small 30-100 nm membrane vesicles released from hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells and function to promote intercellular communication. They are generated through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane and release of interluminal vesicles. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that macrophages infected with Mycobacterium release exosomes that promote activation of both innate and acquired immune responses; however, the components present in exosomes inducing these host responses were not defined. This study used LC-MS/MS to identify 41 mycobacterial proteins present in exosomes released from M. tuberculosis-infected J774 cells. Many of these proteins have been characterized as highly immunogenic. Further, since most of the mycobacterial proteins identified are actively secreted, we hypothesized that macrophages treated with M. tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins (CFPs) would release exosomes containing mycobacterial proteins. We found 29 M. tuberculosis proteins in exosomes released from CFP-treated J774 cells, the majority of which were also present in exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis-infected cells. The exosomes from CFP-treated J774 cells could promote macrophage and dendritic cell activation as well as activation of naïve T cells in vivo. These results suggest that exosomes containing M. tuberculosis antigens may be alternative approach to developing a tuberculosis vaccine.	PMC3664454

Release of exosomes from differentiated neurons and its regulation by synaptic glutamatergic activity.	Mol Cell Neurosci	2011	Exosomes are microvesicles released into the extracellular medium upon fusion to the plasma membrane of endosomal intermediates called multivesicular bodies. They represent ways for discarding proteins and metabolites and also for intercellular transfer of proteins and RNAs. In the nervous system, it has been hypothesized that exosomes might be involved in the normal physiology of the synapse and possibly allow the trans-synaptic propagation of pathogenic proteins throughout the tissue. As a first step to validate this concept, we used biochemical and morphological approaches to demonstrate that mature cortical neurons in culture do indeed secrete exosomes. Using electron microscopy, we observed exosomes being released from somato-dendritic compartments. The endosomal origin of exosomes was demonstrated by showing that the C-terminal domain of tetanus toxin specifically endocytosed by neurons and accumulating inside multivesicular bodies, is released in the extracellular medium in association with exosomes. Finally, we found that exosomal release is modulated by glutamatergic synaptic activity, suggesting that this process might be part of normal synaptic physiology. Thus, our study paves the way towards the demonstration that exosomes take part in the physiology of the normal and pathological nervous system.

Curr Biol	2011	Autocrine, paracrine, and juxtacrine are recognized modes of action for mammalian EGFR ligands including EGF, TGF-α (TGFα), amphiregulin (AREG), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), betacellulin, epiregulin, and epigen. We identify a new mode of EGFR ligand signaling via exosomes. Human breast and colorectal cancer cells release exosomes containing full-length, signaling-competent EGFR ligands. Exosomes isolated from MDCK cells expressing individual full-length EGFR ligands displayed differential activities; AREG exosomes increased invasiveness of recipient breast cancer cells 4-fold over TGFα or HB-EGF exosomes and 5-fold over equivalent amounts of recombinant AREG. Exosomal AREG displayed significantly greater membrane stability than TGFα or HB-EGF. An average of 24 AREG molecules are packaged within an individual exosome, and AREG exosomes are rapidly internalized by recipient cells. Whether the composition and behavior of exosomes differ between nontransformed and transformed cells is unknown. Exosomes from DLD-1 colon cancer cells with a mutant KRAS allele exhibited both higher AREG levels and greater invasive potential than exosomes from isogenically matched, nontransformed cells in which mutant KRAS was eliminated by homologous recombination. We speculate that EGFR ligand signaling via exosomes might contribute to diverse cancer phenomena such as field effect and priming of the metastatic niche.	PMC3417320

Isolation of exosomes for subsequent mRNA, MicroRNA, and protein profiling.	Methods Mol Biol	2011	Exosomes are nano-sized, cell membrane surrounded structures that are released from many cell types. These exosomes are believed to transport a range of molecules, including mRNAs, miRNAs, and proteins; the contents depending on their cell of origin. The physiological and pathological relevance of exosomes has yet to be fully elucidated. Exosomes have been implicated in cell-to-cell communication. For example, in relation to the immune system, such exosomes may enable exchange of antigen or major histocompatibility complex-peptide complexes between antigen-bearing cells and antigen-presenting cells; in cancer, they may contain molecules that not only have relevance as biomarkers, but may also be taken up and cause adverse effects on secondary cells. Furthermore, exosomes have been proposed as autologous delivery systems that could be exploited for personalised delivery of therapeutics. In order to explore the contents and functional relevance of exosomes from medium conditioned by culture cells or from other biological fluids, prior to extensive molecular profiling, they must be isolated and purified. Here, we describe differential centrifugation methods suitable for isolating exosomes from conditioned medium and from other biological fluids, including serum, saliva, tumour ascites, and urine. We also detail Western blotting and transmission electron microscopy methods suitable for basic assessment of their presence, size, and purity, prior to progressing to global mRNA, miRNA, or protein profiling.

Unraveling the Mystery of Cancer by Secretory microRNA: Horizontal microRNA Transfer between Living Cells.	Front Genet	2011	microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as a fine-tuner in a wide array of biological processes, including development, organogenesis, metabolism, and homeostasis. Deregulation of miRNAs causes diseases, especially cancer. This occurs through a variety of mechanisms, such as genetic alterations, epigenetic regulation, or altered expression of transcription factors, which target miRNAs. Recently, it was discovered that extracellular miRNAs circulate in the blood of both healthy and diseased patients. Since RNase is abundant in the bloodstream, most of the secretory miRNAs are contained in apoptotic bodies, microvesicles, and exosomes or bound to the RNA-binding proteins. However, the secretory mechanism and biological function, as well as the significance of extracellular miRNAs, remain largely unclear. In this article, we summarize the latest and most significant discoveries in recent peer-reviewed research on secretory miRNA involvement in many aspects of physiological and pathological conditions, with a special focus on cancer. In addition, we discuss a new aspect of cancer research that is revealed by the emergence of "secretory miRNA."	PMC3262223

Sonic hedgehog-modified human CD34+ cells preserve cardiac function after acute myocardial infarction.	Circ Res	2012	RATIONALE: Ischemic cardiovascular disease represents one of the largest epidemics currently facing the aging population. Current literature has illustrated the efficacy of autologous, stem cell therapies as novel strategies for treating these disorders. The CD34+ hematopoetic stem cell has shown significant promise in addressing myocardial ischemia by promoting angiogenesis that helps preserve the functionality of ischemic myocardium. Unfortunately, both viability and angiogenic quality of autologous CD34+ cells decline with advanced age and diminished cardiovascular health. OBJECTIVE: To offset age- and health-related angiogenic declines in CD34+ cells, we explored whether the therapeutic efficacy of human CD34+ cells could be enhanced by augmenting their secretion of the known angiogenic factor, sonic hedgehog (Shh). METHODS AND RESULTS: When injected into the border zone of mice after acute myocardial infarction, Shh-modified CD34+ cells (CD34(Shh)) protected against ventricular dilation and cardiac functional declines associated with acute myocardial infarction. Treatment with CD34(Shh) also reduced infarct size and increased border zone capillary density compared with unmodified CD34 cells or cells transfected with the empty vector. CD34(Shh) primarily store and secrete Shh protein in exosomes and this storage process appears to be cell-type specific. In vitro analysis of exosomes derived from CD34(Shh) revealed that (1) exosomes transfer Shh protein to other cell types, and (2) exosomal transfer of functional Shh elicits induction of the canonical Shh signaling pathway in recipient cells. CONCLUSIONS: Exosome-mediated delivery of Shh to ischemic myocardium represents a major mechanism explaining the observed preservation of cardiac function in mice treated with CD34(Shh) cells.

BMC Genomics	2012	BACKGROUND: Dis3 is ribonuclease that acts directly in the processing, turnover, and surveillance of a large number of distinct RNA species. Evolutionarily conserved from eubacteria to eukaryotes and a crucial component of the RNA processing exosome, Dis3 has been shown to be essential in yeast and fly S2 cells. However, it is not known whether Dis3 has essential functions in a metazoan. This study inquires whether Dis3 is required for Drosophila development and viability and how Dis3 regulates the transcriptome in the developing fly. RESULTS: Using transgenic flies, we show that Dis3 knock down (Dis3KD) retards growth, induces melanotic tumor formation, and ultimately results in 2nd instar larval lethality. In order to determine whether Dis3KD fly phenotypes were a consequence of disrupting developmentally regulated RNA turnover, we performed RNA deep sequencing analysis on total RNA isolated from developmentally staged animals. Bioinformatic analysis of transcripts from Dis3KD flies reveals substantial transcriptomic changes, most notably down-regulation in early expressed RNAs. Finally, gene ontology analysis of this early stage shows that Dis3 regulates transcripts related to extracellular structure and remodelling, neurogenesis, and nucleotide metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Dis3 is essential for early Drosophila melanogaster development and has specific and important stage-specific roles in regulating RNA metabolism. In showing for the first time that Dis3 is required for the development of a multicellular organism, our work provides mechanistic insight into how Dis3-either independent of or associated with the RNA processing exosome-participates in cell type-specific RNA turnover in metazoan development.

The exosome secretory pathway transports amyloid precursor protein carboxyl-terminal fragments from the cell into the brain extracellular space.	J Biol Chem	2012	In vitro studies have shown that neuronal cell cultures secrete exosomes containing amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and the APP-processing products, C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and amyloid-β (Aβ). We investigated the secretion of full-length APP (flAPP) and APP CTFs via the exosome secretory pathway in vivo. To this end, we developed a novel protocol designed to isolate exosomes secreted into mouse brain extracellular space. Exosomes with typical morphology were isolated from freshly removed mouse brains and from frozen mouse and human brain tissues, demonstrating that exosomes can be isolated from post-mortem tissue frozen for long periods of time. flAPP, APP CTFs, and enzymes that cleave both flAPP and APP CTFs were identified in brain exosomes. Although higher levels of both flAPP and APP CTFs were observed in exosomes isolated from the brains of transgenic mice overexpressing human APP (Tg2576) compared with wild-type control mice, there was no difference in the number of secreted brain exosomes. These data indicate that the levels of flAPP and APP CTFs associated with exosomes mirror the cellular levels of flAPP and APP CTFs. Interestingly, exosomes isolated from the brains of both Tg2576 and wild-type mice are enriched with APP CTFs relative to flAPP. Thus, we hypothesize that the exosome secretory pathway plays a pleiotropic role in the brain: exosome secretion is beneficial to the cell, acting as a specific releasing system of neurotoxic APP CTFs and Aβ, but the secretion of exosomes enriched with APP CTFs, neurotoxic proteins that are also a source of secreted Aβ, is harmful to the brain.

Engraftment patterns of human adult mesenchymal stem cells expose electrotonic and paracrine proarrhythmic mechanisms in myocardial cell cultures.	Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol	2013	BACKGROUND: After intramyocardial injection, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may engraft and influence host myocardium. However, engraftment rate and pattern of distribution are difficult to control in vivo, hampering assessment of potential adverse effects. In this study, the role of the engraftment patterns of MSCs on arrhythmicity in controllable in vitro models is investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cocultures of 4×10(5) neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and 7% or 28% adult human MSCs (hMSCs) in diffuse or clustered distribution patterns were prepared. Electrophysiological effects were studied by optical mapping and patch-clamping. In diffuse cocultures, hMSCs dose-dependently decreased neonatal rat cardiomyocyte excitability, slowed conduction, and prolonged action potential duration until 90% repolarization (APD90). Triggered activity (14% versus 0% in controls) and increased inducibility of re-entry (53% versus 6% in controls) were observed in 28% hMSC cocultures. MSC clusters increased APD90, slowed conduction locally, and increased re-entry inducibility (23%), without increasing triggered activity. Pharmacological heterocellular electric uncoupling increased excitability and conduction velocity to 133% in 28% hMSC cocultures, but did not alter APD90. Transwell experiments showed that hMSCs dose-dependently increased APD90, APD dispersion, inducibility of re-entry and affected specific ion channel protein levels, whereas excitability was unaltered. Incubation with hMSC-derived exosomes did not increase APD in neonatal rat cardiomyocyte cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Adult hMSCs affect arrhythmicity of neonatal rat cardiomyocyte cultures by heterocellular coupling leading to depolarization-induced conduction slowing and by direct release of paracrine factors that negatively affect repolarization rate. The extent of these detrimental effects depends on the number and distribution pattern of hMSCs. These results suggest that caution should be urged against potential adverse effects of myocardial hMSC engraftment.	
23618405	Hui Qian				Exosomes released by human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells protect against cisplatin-induced renal oxidative stress and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro.	Stem Cell Res Ther	2013	INTRODUCTION: Administration of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or secreted microvesicles improves recovery from acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the potential roles and mechanisms are not well understood. In the current study, we focused on the protective effect of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSC-ex) on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: We constructed cisplatin-induced AKI rat models. At 24 h after treatment with cisplatin, hucMSC-ex were injected into the kidneys via the renal capsule; human lung fibroblast (HFL-1)-secreted exosomes (HFL-1-ex) were used as controls. All animals were killed at day 5 after administration of cisplatin. Renal function, histological changes, tubular apoptosis and proliferation, and degree of oxidative stress were evaluated. In vitro, rat renal tubular epithelial (NRK-52E) cells were treated with or without cisplatin and after 6 h treated with or without exosomes. Cells continued to be cultured for 24 h, and were then harvested for western blotting, apoptosis and detection of degree of oxidative stress. RESULTS: After administration of cisplatin, there was an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels, apoptosis, necrosis of proximal kidney tubules and formation of abundant tubular protein casts and oxidative stress in rats. Cisplatin-induced AKI rats treated with hucMSC-ex, however, showed a significant reduction in all the above indexes. In vitro, treatment with cisplatin alone in NRK-52E cells resulted in an increase in the number of apoptotic cells, oxidative stress and activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) pathway followed by a rise in the expression of caspase 3, and a decrease in cell multiplication, while those results were reversed in the hucMSCs-ex-treated group. Furthermore, it was observed that hucMSC-ex promoted cell proliferation by activation of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The results in the present study indicate that hucMSC-ex can repair cisplatin-induced AKI in rats and NRK-52E cell injury by ameliorating oxidative stress and cell apoptosis, promoting cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. This suggests that hucMSC-ex could be exploited as a potential therapeutic tool in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.	PMC3707035

Real-time quantitative PCR and droplet digital PCR for plant miRNAs in mammalian blood provide little evidence for general uptake of dietary miRNAs: limited evidence for general uptake of dietary plant xenomiRs.	RNA Biol	2013	Evidence that exogenous dietary miRNAs enter the bloodstream and tissues of ingesting animals has been accompanied by an indication that at least one plant miRNA, miR168, participates in "cross-kingdom" regulation of a mammalian transcript. If confirmed, these findings would support investigation of miRNA-based dietary interventions in disease. Here, blood was obtained pre- and post-prandially (1, 4, 12 h) from pigtailed macaques that received a miRNA-rich plant-based substance. Plant and endogenous miRNAs were measured by RT-qPCR. Although low-level amplification was observed for some plant miRNA assays, amplification was variable and possibly non-specific, as suggested by droplet digital PCR. A consistent response to dietary intake was not observed. While our results do not support general and consistent uptake of dietary plant miRNAs, additional studies are needed to establish whether or not plant or animal xenomiRs are transferred across the gut in sufficient quantity to regulate endogenous genes.

J Biol Chem	2013	Recent studies indicate that membrane vesicles (MVs) secreted by various cells are associated with human diseases, including arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and chronic kidney disease. The possibility that MVs may induce the formation of mineralo-organic nanoparticles (NPs) and ectopic calcification has not been investigated so far. Here, we isolated MVs ranging in size between 20 and 400 nm from human serum and FBS using ultracentrifugation and sucrose gradient centrifugation. The MV preparations consisted of phospholipid-bound vesicles containing the serum proteins albumin, fetuin-A, and apolipoprotein A1; the mineralization-associated enzyme alkaline phosphatase; and the exosome proteins TNFR1 and CD63. Notably, we observed that MVs induced mineral precipitation following inoculation and incubation in cell culture medium. The mineral precipitates consisted of round, mineralo-organic NPs containing carbonate hydroxyapatite, similar to previous descriptions of the so-called nanobacteria. Annexin V-immunogold staining revealed that the calcium-binding lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) was exposed on the external surface of serum MVs. Treatment of MVs with an anti-PS antibody significantly decreased their mineral seeding activity, suggesting that PS may provide nucleating sites for calcium phosphate deposition on the vesicles. These results indicate that MVs may represent nucleating agents that induce the formation of mineral NPs in body fluids. Given that mineralo-organic NPs represent precursors of calcification in vivo, our results suggest that MVs may initiate ectopic calcification in the human body.	PMC3798528

Heat shock improves Sca-1+ stem cell survival and directs ischemic cardiomyocytes toward a prosurvival phenotype via exosomal transfer: a critical role for HSF1/miR-34a/HSP70 pathway.	Stem Cells	2014	Stem cell-based therapy is a promising intervention for ischemic heart diseases. However, the functional integrity of stem cells is impaired in an ischemic environment. Here, we report a novel finding that heat shock significantly improves Sca-1(+) stem cell survival in an ischemic environment by the regulation of the triangle: heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), HSF1/miR-34a, and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Initially we prove that HSP70 is the key chaperone-mediating cytoprotective effect of heat shock in Sca-1(+) cells and then we establish miR-34a as a direct repressor of HSP70. We found that miR-34a was downregulated in heat shocked Sca-11 stem cells (HSSca-11 cells) [corrected]. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that the downregulation of miR-34a is attributed to HSF1-mediated epigenetic repression through histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) on miR-34a promoter. Moreover, we show that heat shock induces exosomal transfer of HSF1 from Sca-1(+) cells, which directs ischemic cardiomyocytes toward a prosurvival phenotype by epigenetic repression of miR-34a. In addition, our in vivo study demonstrates that transplantation of (HS) Sca-1(+) cells significantly reduces apoptosis, attenuates fibrosis, and improves global heart functions in ischemic myocardium. Hence, our study provides not only novel insights into the effects of heat shock on stem cell survival and paracrine behavior but also may have therapeutic values for stem cell therapy in ischemic heart diseases.

Isolation and quantification of microRNAs from urinary exosomes/microvesicles for biomarker discovery.	Int J Biol Sci	2013	Recent studies indicate that microRNA (miRNA) is contained within exosome. Here we sought to optimize the methodologies for the isolation and quantification of urinary exosomal microRNA as a prelude to biomarker discovery studies. Exosomes were isolated through ultracentrifugation and characterized by immunoelectron microscopy. To determine the RNA was confined inside exosomes, the pellet was treated with RNase before RNA isolation. The minimum urine volume, storage conditions for exosomes and exosomal miRNA was evaluated. The presence of miRNAs in patients with various kidney diseases was validated with real-time PCR. The result shows that miRNAs extracted from the exosomal fraction were resistant to RNase digestion and with high quality confirmed by agarose electrophoresis. 16 ml of urine was sufficient for miRNA isolation by absolute quantification with 4.15×10(5) copies/ul for miR-200c. Exosomes was stable at 4℃ 24h for shipping before stored at -80℃ and was stable in urine when stored at -80°C for 12 months. Exosomal miRNA was detectable despite 5 repeat freeze-thaw cycles. The detection of miRNA by quantitative PCR showed high reproducibility (>94% for intra-assay and >76% for inter-assay), high sensitivity (positive call 100% for CKD patients), broad dynamic range (8-log wide) and good linearity for quantification (R(2)>0.99). miR-29c and miR-200c showed different expression in different types of kidney disease. In summary, the presence of urinary exosomal miRNA was confirmed for patients with a diversity of chronic kidney disease. The conditions of urine collection, storage and miRNA detection determined in this study may be useful for future biomarker discovery efforts.	PMC3831115

Functional prostate-specific membrane antigen is enriched in exosomes from prostate cancer cells.	Int J Oncol	2014	Developing simple and effective approaches to detect tumor markers will be critical for early diagnosis or prognostic evaluation of prostate cancer treatment. Prostate‑specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been validated as an important tumor marker for prostate cancer progression including angiogenesis and metastasis. As a type II membrane protein, PSMA can be constitutively internalized from the cell surface into endosomes. Early endosomes can fuse with multivesicular bodies (MVB) to form and secrete exosomes (40-100 nm) into the extracellular environment. Herein, we tested whether some of the endosomal PSMA could be transferred to exosomes as an extracellular resource for PSMA. Using PSMA-positive LNCaP cells, the secreted exosomes were collected and isolated from the cultured media. The vesicular structures of exosomes were identified by electron microscopy, and exosomal marker protein CD9 and tumor susceptibility gene (TSG 101) were confirmed by western blot analysis. Our present data demonstrate that PSMA can be enriched in exosomes, exhibiting a higher content of glycosylation and partial proteolysis in comparison to cellular PSMA. An in vitro enzyme assay further confirmed that exosomal PSMA retains functional enzymatic activity. Therefore, our data may suggest a new role for PSMA in prostate cancer progression, and provide opportunities for developing non-invasive approaches for diagnosis or prognosis of prostate cancer.

Electronic address: .	yifen_lee@urmc.rochester.edu		Bladder cancer exosomes contain EDIL-3/Del1 and facilitate cancer progression.	J Urol	2014	PURPOSE: High grade bladder cancer is an extremely aggressive malignancy associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Understanding how exosomes may affect bladder cancer progression could reveal novel therapeutic targets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes derived from human bladder cancer cell lines and the urine of patients with high grade bladder cancer were assessed for the ability to promote cancer progression in standard assays. Exosomes purified from the high grade bladder cancer cell line TCC-SUP and the nonmalignant urothelial cell line SV-HUC were submitted for mass spectrometry analysis. EDIL-3 was identified and selected for further analysis. Western blot was done to determine EDIL-3 levels in urinary exosomes from patients with high grade bladder cancer. shRNA gene knockdown and recombinant EDIL-3 were applied to study EDIL-3 function. RESULTS: Exosomes isolated from high grade bladder cancer cells and the urine of patients with high grade bladder cancer promoted angiogenesis and migration of bladder cancer cells and endothelial cells. We silenced EDIL-3 expression and found that shEDIL-3 exosomes did not facilitate angiogenesis, and urothelial and endothelial cell migration. Moreover, exosomes purified from the urine of patients with high grade bladder cancer contained significantly higher EDIL-3 levels than exosomes from the urine of healthy controls. EDIL-3 activated epidermal growth factor receptor signaling while blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling abrogated this EDIL-3 induced bladder cell migration. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes derived from the urine of patients with bladder cancer contains bioactive molecules such as EDIL-3. Identifying these components and their associated oncogenic pathways could lead to novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies.

Different exosome cargo from plasma/bronchoalveolar lavage in non-small-cell lung cancer.	Genes Chromosomes Cancer	2014	Tumor-derived exosomes mediate tumorigenesis by facilitating tumor growth, metastasis, development of drug resistance, and immunosuppression. However, little is known about the exosomes isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients with lung neoplasm. Exosomes isolated in plasma and BAL from 30 and 75 patients with tumor and nontumor pathology were quantified by acetylcholinesterase activity and characterized by Western Blot, Electron Microscopy, and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. Differences in exosome cargo were analyzed by miRNA quantitative PCR in pooled samples and validated in a second series of patients. More exosomes were detected in plasma than in BAL in both groups (P < 0.001). The most miRNAs evaluated by PCR array were detected in tumor plasma, tumor BAL, and nontumor BAL pools, but only 56% were detected in the nontumor plasma pool. Comparing the top miRNAs with the highest levels detected in each pool, we found close homology only between the BAL samples of the two pathologies. In tumor plasma, we found a higher percentage of miRNAs with increased levels than in tumor BAL or in nontumor plasma. The data reveal differences between BAL and plasma exosome amount and miRNA content.

Electronic address: .	david.brigstock@nationwidechildrens.org		Exosomes mediate intercellular transfer of pro-fibrogenic connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) between hepatic stellate cells, the principal fibrotic cells in the liver.	Surgery	2014	BACKGROUND: Fibrogenic pathways in the liver are principally regulated by hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which produce and respond to fibrotic mediators such as connective tissue growth factor (CCN2). The aim of this study was to determine whether CCN2 is shuttled between HSC in membranous nanovesicles, or "exosomes." METHODS: Exosomes were incubated with HSC after isolation from conditioned medium of control or CCN2-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transfected primary mouse HSC or human LX-2 HSC. Some exosomes were stained fluorescently with PKH26. HSC co-culture experiments were performed in the presence of GW4869 exosome inhibitor. CCN2 or CCN2-GFP were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. RESULTS: HSC-derived exosomes contained CCN2 or CCN2 mRNA, each of which increased in concentration during HSC activation or after transfection of HSC with CCN2-GFP. Exosomes, stained with either PKH26 or purified from CCN2-GFP-transfected cells, were taken up by activated or quiescent HSC resulting in CCN2-GFP delivery, as shown by their direct addition to recipient cells or by the GW4869-dependency of donor HSC. CONCLUSION: CCN2 is packaged into secreted, nano-sized exosomes that mediate its intercellular transfer between HSC. Exosomal CCN2 may amplify or fine tune fibrogenic signaling and, in conjunction with other exosome constituents, may have utility as a noninvasive biomarker to assess hepatic fibrosis.	PMC4150742

Exosome/staphylococcal enterotoxin B, an anti tumor compound against pancreatic cancer.	J BUON	2014 Apr-Jun	PURPOSE: Exosomes (EXOs) are acellular vehicles used for cancer immunotherapy due to their immune-inducing properties. We synthesized a novel structure based on EXOs and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and surveyed its cytostatic effect on a pancreatic cell line. METHODS: EXOs were purified from tumor cells and SEB was anchored on it by protein transfer method. To determine the cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effect of this structure, treated cells with different concentrations of EXO/SEB were examined by MTT assay and Hoechst staining method. In addition, the expression rate of bcl-2, bax, bak, fas, bcl-xl and the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were assessed. RESULTS: We observed that 0.5 and 2.5 μg/100μl of EXO/ SEB significantly (p<0.001) stimulated apoptosis after 24 hrs. The concentrations of 0.5 and 2.5μg/100μl of EXO/SEB raised the expression rate of bax, bak, fas (p<0.001) but had no impact on bcl-2 and bcl-xl after 48 hrs. Furthermore, it was shown that 0.5, 2.5 and 5 μg/100μl of EXO/SEB only increased the activity of caspase-3 after 48 hrs (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our designed structure, the EXO/SEB, is a novel model being able to induce apoptosis.

Exosomes mediate drug resistance transfer in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and a probable mechanism is delivery of P-glycoprotein.	Tumour Biol	2014	Acquired drug resistance is a major obstacle to chemotherapy of cancers. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of exosomes in drug-resistance transfer between breast cancer cells and detect the probable mechanism. A docetaxel-resistant variant of MCF-7 cell line (MCF-7/DOC) was established and then compared with the drug-sensitive variant (MCF-7/S). Exosomes were expelled from the cell supernatant using ultracentrifugation. Drug resistance was assessed by apoptosis assay and MTT examination. Expressions of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Stained exosomes were absorbed by receipt cells. MCF-7/S in the presence of exosomes extracted from the supernatant of MCF-7/DOC (DOC/exo) acquired drug resistance, while MCF-7/S exposed to their own exosomes (S/exo) did not. P-gp expression patterns of exosomes were similar as the originated cells. P-gp expression of MCF-7/S increased after incubation with DOC/exo and was affected by the amount of exosomes. Exosomes are effective in transferring drug resistance as well as P-gp from drug-resistant breast cancer cells to sensitive ones. The delivery of P-gp via exosomes may be a mechanism of exosome-mediated drug resistance transfer.

Different immunogenicity but similar antitumor efficacy of two DNA vaccines coding for an antigen secreted in different membrane vesicle-associated forms.	J Extracell Vesicles	2014	The induction of an active immune response to control or eliminate tumours is still an unfulfilled challenge. We focused on plasmid DNA vaccines using an innovative approach whereby the antigen is expressed in association with extracellular vesicles (EVs) to facilitate antigen cross-presentation and improve induced immunity. Our two groups had independently shown previously that DNA vaccines encoding EV-associated antigens are more efficient at inducing cytotoxic T-cell responses than vaccines encoding the non-EV-associated antigen. Here, we compared our two approaches to associate the ovalbumin (OVA) antigen to EVs: (a) by fusion to the lipid-binding domain C1C2 of MFGE8(=lactadherin), which is exposed on the surface of secreted membrane vesicles; and (b) by fusion to retroviral Gag capsid protein, which is incorporated inside membrane-enclosed virus-like particles. Plasmids encoding either form of modified OVA were used as DNA-based vaccines (i.e. injected into mice to allow in vivo expression of the antigen associated to EVs). We show that both DNA vaccines induced, with similar efficiency, OVA-specific CD8(+) T cells and total IgG antibodies. By contrast, each vaccine preferentially stimulated different isotypes of immunoglobulins, and the OVA-C1C2-encoding vaccine favoured antigen-specific CD4(+) T lymphocyte induction as compared to the Gag-OVA vaccine. Nevertheless, both OVA-C1C2 and Gag-OVA vaccines efficiently prevented in vivo outgrowth of OVA-expressing tumours and reduced tumour progression when administered to tumour-bearing mice, although with variable efficacies depending on the tumour models. DNA vaccines encoding EV-associated antigens are thus promising immunotherapy tools in cancer but also potentially other diseases.	PMC4149746

Lipidomic and proteomic characterization of platelet extracellular vesicle subfractions from senescent platelets.	Transfusion	2015	BACKGROUND: Platelets (PLTs) in stored PLT concentrates (PLCs) release PLT extracellular vesicles (PL-EVs) induced by senescence and activation, resembling the PLT storage lesion. No comprehensive classification or molecular characterization of senescence-induced PL-EVs exists to understand PL-EV heterogeneity. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PL-EVs from 5-day-stored PLCs from healthy individuals were isolated and subfractionated by differential centrifugation, filtration, and density gradient ultracentrifugation into five PLT microvesicle (PL-MV) subfractions (Fraction [F]1-F5) and PLT exosomes (PL-EXs). PL-EV size, concentration, and composition were analyzed by nanoparticle tracking analysis, flow cytometry, and lipid and protein mass spectrometry. Protein data were verified by Western blot. RESULTS: PL-EVs showed overlapping mean particle sizes of 180 to 260 nm, but differed significantly in composition. Less dense, intermediate, and dense PL-MVs enriched specific lipidomic and proteomic markers related to the plasma membrane, intracellular membranes, PLT granules, mitochondria, and PLT activation. α-Synuclein (81% of total) accumulated in F1 and F2, amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein in F3 and F4 (84%), and apolipoprotein (Apo)E (88%) and ApoJ (92%) in F3 to F5. PL-EXs enriched lipid species and proteins, with high abundance of lipid raft, PLT adhesion, and immune response-related markers. CONCLUSION: Differential lipid and protein compositions of PL-EVs suggest their unique cellular origins and functions, partly overlapping with PLT granule secretion. Dense PL-MVs might represent autophagic vesicles released during PLT activation and apoptosis and PL-EXs resemble lipid rafts, with a potential role in PLT aggregation and immunity. Segregation of α-synuclein and Aβ precursor protein, ApoE, and ApoJ into less dense and dense PL-MVs, respectively, show their differential carrier role of neurologic disease-related cargo.

BMC Cancer	2014	BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is a tumour arising from melanocytes of the eye, and 30 per cent of these patients develop liver metastases. Exosomes are small RNA containing nano-vesicles released by most cells, including malignant melanoma cells. This clinical translational study included patients undergoing isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) for metastatic uveal melanoma, from whom exosomes were isolated directly from liver perfusates. The objective was to determine whether exosomes are present in the liver circulation, and to ascertain whether these may originate from melanoma cells. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from the liver perfusate of twelve patients with liver metastases from uveal melanoma undergoing IHP. Exosomes were visualised by electron microscopy, and characterised by flow cytometry, Western blot and real-time PCR. Furthermore, the concentration of peripheral blood exosomes were measured and compared to healthy controls. RESULTS: The liver perfusate contained Melan-A positive and RNA containing exosomes, with similar miRNA profiles among patients, but dissimilar miRNA compared to exosomes isolated from tumor cell cultures. Patients with metastatic uveal melanoma had a higher concentration of exosomes in their peripheral venous blood compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Melanoma exosomes are released into the liver circulation in metastatic uveal melanoma, and is associated with higher concentrations of exosomes in the systemic circulation. The exosomes isolated directly from liver circulation contain miRNA clusters that are different from exosomes from other cellular sources.	PMC4320618

Exosome-mediated inflammasome signaling after central nervous system injury.	J Neurochem	2016	Neuroinflammation is a response against harmful effects of diverse stimuli and participates in the pathogenesis of brain and spinal cord injury (SCI). The innate immune response plays a role in neuroinflammation following CNS injury via activation of multiprotein complexes termed inflammasomes that regulate the activation of caspase 1 and the processing of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. We report here that the expression of components of the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein-1 (NLRP-1) inflammasome, apoptosis speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and caspase 1 are significantly elevated in spinal cord motor neurons and cortical neurons after CNS trauma. Moreover, NLRP1 inflammasome proteins are present in exosomes derived from CSF of SCI and traumatic brain-injured patients following trauma. To investigate whether exosomes could be used to therapeutically block inflammasome activation in the CNS, exosomes were isolated from embryonic cortical neuronal cultures and loaded with short-interfering RNA (siRNA) against ASC and administered to spinal cord-injured animals. Neuronal-derived exosomes crossed the injured blood-spinal cord barrier, and delivered their cargo in vivo, resulting in knockdown of ASC protein levels by approximately 76% when compared to SCI rats treated with scrambled siRNA. Surprisingly, siRNA silencing of ASC also led to a significant decrease in caspase 1 activation and processing of IL-1β after SCI. These findings indicate that exosome-mediated siRNA delivery may be a strong candidate to block inflammasome activation following CNS injury. We propose the following signaling cascade for inflammasome activation in peripheral tissues after CNS injury: CNS trauma induces inflammasome activation in the nervous system and secretion of exosomes containing inflammasome protein cargo into cerebral spinal fluid. The inflammasome containing exosomes then fuse with target cells to activate the innate immune response in peripheral tissues. We suggest that these findings may be used to develop new therapeutics to treat the devastating inflammation and cell destruction evoked by CNS injuries. IL-1β and IL-18 = pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Stem Cells Transl Med	2015	Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) and their exosomes have been considered as potential therapeutic tools for tissue regeneration; however, the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. In this study, we isolated and characterized the exosomes from hucMSCs (hucMSC-Ex) and demonstrated that hucMSC-Ex promoted the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that hucMSC-Ex promoted wound healing and angiogenesis in vivo by using a rat skin burn model. We discovered that hucMSC-Ex promoted β-catenin nuclear translocation and induced the increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin D3, N-cadherin, and β-catenin and the decreased expression of E-cadherin. The activation of Wnt/β-catenin is critical in the induction of angiogenesis by hucMSC-Ex, which could be reversed by β-catenin inhibitor ICG-001. Wnt4 was delivered by hucMSC-Ex, and the knockdown of Wnt4 in hucMSC-Ex abrogated β-catenin nuclear translocation in endothelial cells. The in vivo proangiogenic effects were also inhibited by interference of Wnt4 expression in hucMSC-Ex. Taken together, these results suggest that hucMSC-Ex-mediated Wnt4 induces β-catenin activation in endothelial cells and exerts proangiogenic effects, which could be an important mechanism for cutaneous wound healing.

Anticancer Res	2015	BACKGROUND: In recent years, evidence has accumulated indicating that both normal and cancer cells communicate via the release and delivery of macromolecules packed into extracellular membrane vesicles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We isolated nano-sized extracellular vesicles from MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines using ultracentrifugation and exosome precipitation (Exoquick) protocols. These vesicles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blotting. Exosomal miRNA profiles were obtained using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) ready-to-use panel measuring a total of 742 miRNAs. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines secrete populations of miRNAs inside small exosome-like vesicular particles. These particles were shown to be taken-up by recipient cells. By profiling the miRNA content, we demonstrated high expression of a group of established oncomirs in exosomes from two MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines. Despite the fact that other studies have demonstrated the ability of exosomal miRNAs both to repress mRNA targets and to stimulate Toll-like receptor-8 (TLR8) signaling in recipient cells, we did not observe these effects with exosomes from MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells. However, functional enrichment analysis reveals that mRNA targets of highly expressed exosomal miRNAs are associated with a range of cellular and molecular functions related to cell growth and cell death. CONCLUSION: MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines secrete exosome-like particles containing oncogenic miRNAs. This work showed for the first time that neuroblastoma cells secrete exosome-like particles containing miRNAs with potential roles in cancer progression. These findings indicate a new way for MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells to interact with the tumor environment.

Ischemic preconditioning potentiates the protective effect of mesenchymal stem cells on endotoxin-induced acute lung injury in mice through secretion of exosome.	Int J Clin Exp Med	2015	OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on endotoxin-induced acute lung injury in mice and verify the role of exosome. METHODS: Exosome was isolated from the culture supernatant of MSC. For ischemic preconditioning, MSCs were subjected to anoxia for 0 min (MSCs group), 30 min (MSCs(IPC-30) group), 60 min (MSCs(IPC-60) group) and 90 min (MSCs(IPC 90) group), and then used to treat endotoxin-injured mice. The exosome from the optimal group was used to treat endotoxin-injured mice. In addition, the exosome from the optimal group was also used to treat the endotoxin-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells for 6 h and 12 h. RESULTS: CD63 positive exosome were acquired through ExoQuick kits. Administration of MSCs, MSCs(IPC-30), MSCs(IPC-60) and MSCs(IPC-90) could reduce the level of white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils into the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of endotoxin-injured mice, and the MSCIPC-60 group had the greatest reduction, which reduced WBC by 57% and neutrophils by 55%. Administration of MSCs(IPC-60) exosome could also reduce the level of WBC, neutrophils, MIP-2 and penetration protein into the BAL fluid of endotoxin-injured mice, which had the same effect as MSCs(IPC-60) and showed a dose dependent, compared to MSCs exosome. In addition, MSCs(IPC-60) exosome were used to treat endotoxin-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, and the level of TNFα at 6 h and 12 h was significantly reduced, while the level of IL-10 at 12 h increased. CONCLUSION: Ischemic preconditioning for 60 min can potentiates the protective effect of MSC on endotoxin-induced Acute Lung Injury through the secretion of Exosome.	PMC4443114

Electronic address: .	fe_limana@hotmail.com		Exosomal clusterin, identified in the pericardial fluid, improves myocardial performance following MI through epicardial activation, enhanced arteriogenesis and reduced apoptosis.	Int J Cardiol	2015	BACKGROUND: We recently demonstrated that epicardial progenitor cells participate in the regenerative response to myocardial infarction (MI) and factors released in the pericardial fluid (PF) may play a key role in this process. Exosomes are secreted nanovesicles of endocytic origin, identified in most body fluids, which may contain molecules able to modulate a variety of cell functions. Here, we investigated whether exosomes are present in the PF and their potential role in cardiac repair. METHODS AND RESULTS: Early gene expression studies in 3day-infarcted mouse hearts showed that PF induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epicardial cells. Exosomes were identified in PFs from non-infarcted patients (PFC) and patients with acute MI (PFMI). A shotgun proteomics analysis identified clusterin in exosomes isolated from PFMI but not from PFC. Notably, clusterin has a protective effect on cardiomyocytes after acute MI in vivo and is an important mediator of TGFβ-induced. Clusterin addition to the pericardial sac determined an increase in epicardial cells expressing the EMT marker α-SMA and, interestingly, an increase in the number of epicardial cells ckit(+)/α-SMA(+), 7days following MI. Importantly, clusterin treatment enhanced arteriolar length density and lowered apoptotic rates in the peri-infarct area. Hemodynamic studies demonstrated an improvement in cardiac function in clusterin-treated compared to untreated infarcted hearts. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes are present and detectable in the PFs. Clusterin was identified in PFMI-exosomes and might account for an improvement in myocardial performance following MI through a framework including EMT-mediated epicardial activation, arteriogenesis and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Mol Cancer	2015	BACKGROUND: CD90+ liver cancer cells have been described as cancer stem-cell-like (CSC), displaying aggressive and metastatic phenotype. Using two different in vitro models, already described as CD90+ liver cancer stem cells, our aim was to study their interaction with endothelial cells mediated by the release of exosomes. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated and characterized from both liver CD90+ cells and hepatoma cell lines. Endothelial cells were treated with exosomes, as well as transfected with a plasmid containing the full length sequence of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19. Molecular and functional analyses were done to characterize the endothelial phenotype after treatments. RESULTS: Exosomes released by CD90+ cancer cells, but not by parental hepatoma cells, modulated endothelial cells, promoting angiogenic phenotype and cell-to-cell adhesion. LncRNA profiling revealed that CD90+ cells were enriched in lncRNA H19, and released this through exosomes. Experiments of gain and loss of function of H19 showed that this LncRNA plays an important role in the exosome-mediated phenotype of endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate a new exosome-mediated mechanism by which CSC-like CD90+ cells could influence their tumor microenvironment by promoting angiogenesis. Moreover, we suggest the lncRNA H19 as a putative therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma.	PMC4536801

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2015	Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles with the function of intercellular communication, and they are released by various cell types. To reveal the knowledge about the exosomes from osteoblast, and explore the potential functions of osteogenesis, we isolated microvesicles from supernatants of mouse Mc3t3 by ultracentrifugation, characterized exosomes by electron microscopy and immunoblotting and presented the protein profile by proteomic analysis. The result demonstrated that microvesicles were between 30 and 100 nm in diameter, round shape with cup-like concavity and expressed exosomal marker tumor susceptibility gene (TSG) 101 and flotillin (Flot) 1. We identified a total number of 1069 proteins among which 786 proteins overlap with ExoCarta database. Gene Oncology analysis indicated that exosomes mostly derived from plasma membrane and mainly involved in protein localization and intracellular signaling. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed pathways are mostly involved in exosome biogenesis, formation, uptake and osteogenesis. Among the pathways, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 pathways played an important role in osteogenesis. Our study identified osteoblast-derived exosomes, unveiled the content of them, presented potential osteogenesis-related proteins and pathways and provided a rich proteomics data resource that will be valuable for further studies of the functions of individual proteins in bone diseases.

Integrating Protein Engineering and Bioorthogonal Click Conjugation for Extracellular Vesicle Modulation and Intracellular Delivery.	PLoS One	2015	Exosomes are small, cell-secreted vesicles that transfer proteins and genetic information between cells. This intercellular transmission regulates many physiological and pathological processes. Therefore, exosomes have emerged as novel biomarkers for disease diagnosis and as nanocarriers for drug delivery. Here, we report an easy-to-adapt and highly versatile methodology to modulate exosome composition and conjugate exosomes for intracellular delivery. Our strategy combines the metabolic labeling of newly synthesized proteins or glycan/glycoproteins of exosome-secreting cells with active azides and bioorthogonal click conjugation to modify and functionalize the exosomes. The azide-integrated can be conjugated to a variety of small molecules and proteins and can efficiently deliver conjugates into cells. The metabolic engineering of exosomes diversifies the chemistry of exosomes and expands the functions that can be introduced into exosomes, providing novel, powerful tools to study the roles of exosomes in biology and expand the biomedical potential of exosomes.

Exosomal particles secreted by prostate cancer cells are potent mRNA and protein vehicles for the interference of tumor and tumor environment.	Prostate	2016	BACKGROUND: Remodeling of the tumor environment and the modulation of tumor associated non-malignant cells are essential events in tumor progression. Exosomes are small membranous vesicles of 50-150 nm in diameter, which are secreted into the extracellular space and supposedly serve as vehicles for signal and effector molecules to modulate adjacent target cells. We characterized the mRNA and protein composition as well as cellular functions of prostate cancer cell-derived exosomes. METHODS: Exosomes were prepared from prostate cancer cell culture supernatant by ultracentrifugation and subsequently characterized by dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. Exosomal mRNA and protein composition were analyzed by DNA microarrays and gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. Physiological effects of exosomes were studied by means of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase release cell assays. Using a SILAC approach, putative uptake of exosomal human proteins in canine cells and canine de novo synthesis of proteins specified by exosome-transferred human mRNA was analyzed in MDCK cells via mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Preparations of exosomes revealed typical cup shaped particles of 150 nm in diameter. Analysis of mRNA and protein composition of exosomes exhibited a wide range of mRNA and protein species. Interestingly, the packaging of at least small proteins into exosomes was apparently unspecific, as shown with the example of two model proteins. In cell culture incubation experiments exosomal preparations of prostate cancer cells caused anti-proliferative effects. MS analysis revealed the uptake of exosomal human proteins into canine cells after 6 hr of incubation. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal a distinct exosomal functionality in the modulation of the prostatic tumor adjacent environment. The multitude of translocated factors implies the induction of numerous effects in tumor-associated target cells, including impact on cellular growth.	
26752061	John D Sinden	Stem Cell Discovery, ReNeuron, Guildford, United Kingdom.			Investigation of Content, Stoichiometry and Transfer of miRNA from Human Neural Stem Cell Line Derived Exosomes.	PLoS One	2016	Exosomes are small (30-100 nm) membrane vesicles secreted by a variety of cell types and only recently have emerged as a new avenue for cell-to-cell communication. They are natural shuttles of RNA and protein cargo, making them attractive as potential therapeutic delivery vehicles. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs which regulate biological processes and can be found in exosomes. Here we characterized the miRNA contents of exosomes derived from human neural stem cells (hNSCs). Our investigated hNSC line is a clonal, conditionally immortalized cell line, compliant with good manufacturing practice (GMP), and in clinical trials for stroke and critical limb ischemia in the UK (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01151124, NCT02117635, and NCT01916369). By using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology we identified the presence of a variety of miRNAs in both exosomal and cellular preparations. Many of these miRNAs were enriched in exosomes indicating that cells specifically sort them for extracellular release. Although exosomes have been proven to contain miRNAs, the copy number quantification per exosome of a given miRNA remains unclear. Herein we quantified by real-time PCR a highly shuttled exosomal miRNA subtype (hsa-miR-1246) in order to assess its stoichiometry per exosome. Furthermore, we utilized an in vitro system to confirm its functional transfer by measuring the reduction in luciferase expression using a 3' untranslated region dual luciferase reporter assay. In summary, NGS analysis allowed the identification of a unique set of hNSC derived exosomal miRNAs. Stoichiometry and functional transfer analysis of one of the most abundant identified miRNA, hsa-miR-1246, were measured to support biological relevance of exosomal miRNA delivery.	PMC4713432

Tumor-derived exosomes regulate expression of immune function-related genes in human T cell subsets.	Sci Rep	2016	Tumor cell-derived exosomes (TEX) suppress functions of immune cells. Here, changes in the gene profiles of primary human T lymphocytes exposed in vitro to exosomes were evaluated. CD4(+) Tconv, CD8(+) T or CD4(+) CD39(+) Treg were isolated from normal donors' peripheral blood and co-incubated with TEX or exosomes isolated from supernatants of cultured dendritic cells (DEX). Expression levels of 24-27 immune response-related genes in these T cells were quantified by qRT-PCR. In activated T cells, TEX and DEX up-regulated mRNA expression levels of multiple genes. Multifactorial data analysis of ΔCt values identified T cell activation and the immune cell type, but not exosome source, as factors regulating gene expression by exosomes. Treg were more sensitive to TEX-mediated effects than other T cell subsets. In Treg, TEX-mediated down-regulation of genes regulating the adenosine pathway translated into high expression of CD39 and increased adenosine production. TEX also induced up-regulation of inhibitory genes in CD4(+) Tconv, which translated into a loss of CD69 on their surface and a functional decline. Exosomes are not internalized by T cells, but signals they carry and deliver to cell surface receptors modulate gene expression and functions of human T lymphocytes.	PMC4740743

J Extracell Vesicles	2016	Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), a widely used adult stem cell candidate for regenerative medicine, has been shown to exert some of its therapeutic effects through the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). These homogenously sized EVs of 100-150 ηm exhibited many exosome-like biophysical and biochemical properties and carry both proteins and RNAs. Recently, exosome-associated proteins in this MSC EV preparation were found to segregate primarily to those EVs that bind cholera toxin B chain (CTB), a GM1 ganglioside-specific ligand, and pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that these EVs have endosomal origin and carried many of the exosome-associated markers. Here, we report that only a fraction of the MSC EV proteome was found in CTB-bound EVs. Using Annexin V (AV) and Shiga toxin B subunit (ST) with affinities for phosphatidylserine and globotriaosylceramide, respectively, AV- and a ST-binding EV were identified. CTB-, AV- and ST-binding EVs all carried actin. However, the AV-binding EVs carried low or undetectable levels of the exosome-associated proteins. Only the ST-binding EVs carried RNA and EDA-containing fibronectin. Proteins in AV-binding EVs were also different from those released by apoptotic MSCs. CTB- and AV-binding activities were localized to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of MSCs, while ST-binding activity was localized to the nucleus. Together, this study demonstrates that cells secrete many types of EVs. Specifically, MSCs secrete at least 3 types. They can be differentially isolated based on their affinities for membrane lipid-binding ligands. As the subcellular sites of the binding activities of these ligands and cargo load are different for each EV type, they are likely to have a different biogenesis pathway and possibly different functions.

J Am Soc Nephrol	2016	Extracellular vesicles (ECVs) facilitate intercellular communication along the nephron, with the potential to change the function of the recipient cell. However, it is not known whether this is a regulated process analogous to other signaling systems. We investigated the potential hormonal regulation of ECV transfer and report that desmopressin, a vasopressin analogue, stimulated the uptake of fluorescently loaded ECVs into a kidney collecting duct cell line (mCCDC11) and into primary cells. Exposure of mCCDC11 cells to ECVs isolated from cells overexpressing microRNA-503 led to downregulated expression of microRNA-503 target genes, but only in the presence of desmopressin. Mechanistically, ECV entry into mCCDC11 cells required cAMP production, was reduced by inhibiting dynamin, and was selective for ECVs from kidney tubular cells. In vivo, we measured the urinary excretion and tissue uptake of fluorescently loaded ECVs delivered systemically to mice before and after administration of the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan. In control-treated mice, we recovered 2.5% of administered ECVs in the urine; tolvaptan increased recovery five-fold and reduced ECV deposition in kidney tissue. Furthermore, in a patient with central diabetes insipidus, desmopressin reduced the excretion of ECVs derived from glomerular and proximal tubular cells. These data are consistent with vasopressin-regulated uptake of ECVs in vivo We conclude that ECV uptake is a specific and regulated process. Physiologically, ECVs are a new mechanism of intercellular communication; therapeutically, ECVs may be a vehicle by which RNA therapy could be targeted to specific cells for the treatment of kidney disease.

Exosomal microRNA miR-92a concentration in serum reflects human brown fat activity.	Nat Commun	2016	Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy and its activity correlates with leanness in human adults. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography coupled with computer tomography (PET/CT) is still the standard for measuring BAT activity, but exposes subjects to ionizing radiation. To study BAT function in large human cohorts, novel diagnostic tools are needed. Here we show that brown adipocytes release exosomes and that BAT activation increases exosome release. Profiling miRNAs in exosomes released from brown adipocytes, and in exosomes isolated from mouse serum, we show that levels of miRNAs change after BAT activation in vitro and in vivo. One of these exosomal miRNAs, miR-92a, is also present in human serum exosomes. Importantly, serum concentrations of exosomal miR-92a inversely correlate with human BAT activity measured by (18)F-FDG PET/CT in two unique and independent cohorts comprising 41 healthy individuals. Thus, exosomal miR-92a represents a potential serum biomarker for BAT activity in mice and humans.	PMC4853423

J Exp Clin Cancer Res	2016	BACKGROUND: It was reported that metastases might occur via transfer of biologically active blood circulating molecules from the primary tumor to distant organs rather than only migration of cancer cells. We showed in an earlier study that exposure of immortalized human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) to cancer patient sera, induce their transformation into undifferentiated cancers due to a horizontal transfer of malignant traits. In the present work, we tested the hypothesis that even other human cells as long as they are deficient for a single oncosuppressor gene might undergo malignant transformation when exposed to human cancer serum. METHODS: We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to establish a stable BRCA1 knockout (KO) in human fibroblasts. The BRCA1-KO fibroblasts were exposed to cancer patients' sera or healthy patients' sera for 2 weeks. Treated cells were analyzed for cell proliferation and transformation to study their susceptibility to the oncogenic potential of cancer patients' sera and to determine the possible mechanisms underlying their hypothesized transformation. RESULTS: BRCA1-KO fibroblasts treated with cancer patients' sera displayed higher proliferation and underwent malignant transformation as opposed to wild type control fibroblasts, which were not affected by exposure to cancer patients' sera. The malignant transformation was not seen when BRCA1-KO fibroblasts were treated with healthy human sera. Histological analysis of tumors generated by BRCA1-KO fibroblasts showed that they were carcinomas with phenotypical characteristics related to the cancers of the blood donor patients. Interestingly, BRCA1-KO fibroblasts were significantly more prone to internalize serum-derived exosomes, when compared to wild type fibroblasts. This suggests that oncosuppressor genes might protect the integrity of the cell genome also by blocking integration of cancer-derived exosomes. CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that any human cells carrying a single oncosuppressor mutation is capable of integrating cancer factors carried in the blood and undergo complete malignant transformation. Oncosuppressor genes might protect the cell genome by impeding the integration inside the cells of these mutating factors.	PMC4868000

Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA;			Recapitulating the Size and Cargo of Tumor Exosomes in a Tissue-Engineered Model.	Theranostics	2016	There is a growing interest in the pivotal role of exosomes in cancer and in their use as biomarkers. However, despite the importance of the microenvironment for cancer initiation and progression, monolayer cultures of tumor cells still represent the main in vitro source of exosomes. As a result, their environmental regulation remains largely unknown. Here, we report a three-dimensional tumor model for studying exosomes, using Ewing's sarcoma type 1 as a clinically relevant example. The bioengineered model was designed based on the hypothesis that the 3-dimensionality, composition and stiffness of the tumor matrix are the critical determinants of the size and cargo of exosomes released by the cancer cells. We analyzed the effects of the tumor microenvironment on exosomes, and the effects of exosomes on the non-cancer cells from the bone niche. Exosomes from the tissue-engineered tumor had similar size distribution as those in the patients' plasma, and were markedly smaller than those in monolayer cultures. Bioengineered tumors and the patients' plasma contained high levels of the Polycomb histone methyltransferase EZH2 mRNA relatively to their monolayer counterparts. Notably, EZH2 mRNA, a potential tumor biomarker detectable in blood plasma, could be transferred to the surrounding mesenchymal stem cells. This study provides the first evidence that an in vitro culture environment can recapitulate some properties of tumor exosomes.	PMC4893640

FRTL-5 Rat Thyroid Cells Release Thyroglobulin Sequestered in Exosomes: A Possible Novel Mechanism for Thyroglobulin Processing in the Thyroid.	J Thyroid Res	2016	Exosomes are 30-100 nm, membrane-bound vesicles containing specific cellular proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs that take part in intercellular communication between cells. A possible role for exosomes in thyroid function has not been fully explored. In the present study, FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells were grown to confluence and received medium containing either thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), exogenous bovine thyroglobulin (bTg), or neither additive for 24 or 48 hours followed by collection of spent medium and ultracentrifugation to isolate small vesicles. Transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting for CD9 indicated the presence of exosomes. Western blotting of exosome extract using a monoclonal anti-Tg antibody revealed a Tg-positive band at ~330 kDa (the expected size of monomeric Tg) with a higher density in TSH-treated cells compared to that in untreated cells. These results are the first to show that normal thyroid cells in culture produce exosomes containing undegraded Tg.	PMC4917686

Osteoclast-derived microRNA-containing exosomes selectively inhibit osteoblast activity.	Cell Discov	2016	MicroRNAs have an important role in bone homeostasis. However, the detailed mechanism of microRNA-mediated intercellular communication between bone cells remains elusive. Here, we report that osteoclasts secrete microRNA-enriched exosomes, by which miR-214 is transferred into osteoblasts to inhibit their function. In a coculture system, inhibition of exosome formation and secretion prevented miR-214 transportation. Exosomes specifically recognized osteoblasts through the interaction between ephrinA2 and EphA2. In osteoclast-specific miR-214 transgenic mice, exosomes were secreted into the serum, and miR-214 and ephrinA2 levels were elevated. Therefore, these exosomes have an inhibitory role in osteoblast activity. miR-214 and ephrinA2 levels in serum exosomes from osteoporotic patients and mice were upregulated substantially. These exosomes may significantly inhibit osteoblast activity. Inhibition of exosome secretion via Rab27a small interfering RNA prevented ovariectomized-induced osteoblast dysfunction in vivo. Taken together, these findings suggest that exosome-mediated transfer of microRNA plays an important role in the regulation of osteoblast activity. Circulating miR-214 in exosomes not only represents a biomarker for bone loss but could selectively regulate osteoblast function.	PMC4886818

Modulation of Immune Responses by Extracellular Vesicles From Retinal Pigment Epithelium.	Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci	2016	PURPOSE: Extracellular vesicles (EV), such as exosomes, are important mediators of intercellular communication and have been implicated in modulation of the immune system. We investigated if EV released from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) modulate immune responses in vitro. METHODS: Extracellular vesicles were isolated from ARPE-19 cultures stimulated or not with the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. Isolated EV were characterized by nanoparticle flow and Western blot analyses. Retinal pigment epithelium-derived EV were cultured with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which were assayed for T-cell proliferation by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Retinal pigment epithelium-derived EV were also independently cultured with enriched lymphocytes or monocytes. Cell phenotype and cell death were evaluated by flow cytometric analysis. Cytokine levels were assayed in culture supernatants by multiplex bead analysis. RESULTS: The concentration of ARPE-derived EV from cytokine-stimulated cultures was slightly higher than from nonstimulated cultures. The size of EV was approximately 100 nm in both groups. Extracellular vesicles from both nonstimulated and cytokine-stimulated ARPE-19 significantly inhibited T-cell proliferation without affecting T-cell viability. Culture of EV from nonstimulated ARPE-19 with undifferentiated human monocytes induced an immunoregulatory phenotype with a significantly higher percentage of CD14++CD16+ monocytes and upregulation of TGF-β1. Culture of EV from cytokine-stimulated ARPE-19 cells with human monocytes induced upregulation of several proinflammatory cytokines and monocyte death. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal pigment epithelium cells constitutively secrete EV in the size range of exosomes, with increased release from RPE cells stimulated with inflammatory cytokines. Extracellular vesicles from both nonstimulated and cytokine-stimulated RPE inhibited T-cell stimulation. Extracellular vesicles from nonstimulated ARPE-19 cells promoted an immunoregulatory CD14++CD16+ phenotype in human monocytes, while EV from cytokine-stimulated ARPE-19 cells caused human monocyte death. These findings suggest that RPE cells use EV to induce a downregulatory immune environment under homeostatic conditions. In an inflammatory milieu, RPE-derived EV may mitigate a potentially harmful inflammatory response through killing of monocytes.	PMC4991022

Eur J Pharm Sci	2017	It was the aim of this work to determine whether the plasma concentration of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in active diabetic Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN) is connected to the inflammatory markers, temperature elevation in the affected foot and concentration of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). EVs were isolated from peripheral blood of 35 patients with active CN. EVs were counted after repetitive centrifugation and washing of samples, by flow cytometry. Foot temperature was measured by infrared thermometer. Concentration of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found statistically significant correlations of EV concentration (but not soluble RAGE concentration) with C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and with temperature difference between the affected and the contralateral foot (r=0.40, p=0.032; r=0.89, p<10-8, respectively). We provide evidence that the concentration of EVs is related to elevation of markers of inflammation (CRP and foot temperature difference) in acute Diabetic CN. EV-based markers could be considered as a potential aid in early diagnosis of CN.

J Nutr	2016	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are small, gene-regulatory noncoding RNA species present in large amounts in milk, where they seem to be protected against degradative conditions, presumably because of their association with exosomes. OBJECTIVE: We monitored the relative stability of commercial dairy cow milk microRNAs during digestion and examined their associations with extracellular vesicles (EVs). METHODS: We used a computer-controlled, in vitro, gastrointestinal model TNO intestinal model-1 (TIM-1) and analyzed, by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the concentration of 2 microRNAs within gastrointestinal tract compartments at different points in time. EVs within TIM-1 digested and nondigested samples were studied by immunoblotting, dynamic light scattering, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and density measurements. RESULTS: A large quantity of dairy milk Bos taurus microRNA-223 (bta-miR-223) and bta-miR-125b (∼109-1010 copies/300 mL milk) withstood digestion under simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, with the stomach causing the most important decrease in microRNA amounts. A large quantity of these 2 microRNAs (∼108-109 copies/300 mL milk) was detected in the upper small intestine compartments, which supports their potential bioaccessibility. A protocol optimized for the enrichment of dairy milk exosomes yielded a 100,000 × g pellet fraction that was positive for the exosomal markers tumor susceptibility gene-101 (TSG101), apoptosis-linked gene 2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and containing bta-miR-223 and bta-miR-125b. This approach, based on successive ultracentrifugation steps, also revealed the existence of ALIX-, HSP70-/low, and TSG101-/low EVs larger than exosomes and 2-6 times more enriched in bta-miR-223 and bta-miR-125b (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that commercial dairy cow milk contains numerous microRNAs that can resist digestion and are associated mostly with ALIX-, HSP70-/low, and TSG101-/low EVs. Our results support the existence of interspecies transfer of microRNAs mediated by milk consumption and challenge our current view of exosomes as the sole carriers of milk-derived microRNAs.

Methods Mol Biol	2017	The tumor microenvironment is a heterogeneous and dynamic network that exists between cancer and stroma, playing a critical role in cancer progression. Certain tumorigenic signals such as microRNAs are derived from the stroma and conveyed to cancer cells (and vice versa) in nanoparticles called exosomes. Their identification and characterization is an important step in better understanding cellular cross talk and its consequences. To this end we describe how to culture primary ex vivo derived fibroblasts from colorectal tissue, isolate their exosomes, extract exosomal RNA and perform microRNA profiling.	PMC5757798

Increased plasma VEGF levels following ischemic preconditioning are associated with downregulation of miRNA-762 and miR-3072-5p.	Sci Rep	2016	Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has protective effects against ischemia-perfusion injury of organs. In the present study, we investigated the associated mechanisms after performing remote IPC (rIPC) of lower limbs by clamping abdominal aorta in mice. Subsequent experiments showed decreased damage and paralysis of lower limbs following spinal cord injury (SCI). Concomitantly, plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were increased 24 h after rIPC compared with those in sham-operated animals. In subsequent microRNA analyses, thirteen microRNAs were downregulated in exosomes 24 h after rIPC. Further studies of femoral CD34-positive bone marrow (BM) cells confirmed downregulation of these seven microRNAs 24 h after rIPC compared with those in sham-operated controls. Subsequent algorithm-based database searches suggested that two of the seven microRNAs bind to the 3' UTR of VEGF mRNA, and following transfection into CD34-positive BM cells, anti-miR-762, and anti-miR-3072-5p inhibitors led to increased VEGF concentrations. The present data suggest that rIPC transiently increases plasma VEGF levels by downregulating miR-762 and miR-3072-5p in CD34-positive BM cells, leading to protection against organ ischemia.

Inflammation	2017	The pro-inflammatory activation of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells resulting in continuous expression of cellular adhesion molecules, and subsequently recruiting primed neutrophils to form a firm neutrophils-endothelium (PMN-EC) adhesion, has been examined and found to play a vital role in acute lung injury (ALI). RNA interference (RNAi) is a cellular process through harnessing a natural pathway silencing target gene based on recognition and subsequent degradation of specific mRNA sequences. It opens a promising approach for precision medicine. However, this application was hampered by many obstacles, such as immunogenicity, instability, toxicity problems, and difficulty in across the biological membrane. In this study, we reprogrammed urine exfoliated renal epithelial cells into human induced pluripotent stem cells (huiPSCs) and purified the exosomes (Exo) from huiPSCs as RNAi delivery system. Through choosing the episomal system to deliver transcription factors, we obtained a non-integrating huiPSCs. Experiments in both vitro and vivo demonstrated that these huiPSCs possess the pluripotent properties. The exosomes of huiPSCs isolated by differential centrifugation were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showing a typical exosomal appearance with an average diameter of 122 nm. Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of the typical exosomal markers, including CD63, TSG 101, and Alix. Co-cultured PKH26-labeled exosomes with human primary pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) confirmed that they could be internalized by recipient cells at a time-dependent manner. Then, electroporation was used to introduce siRNA against intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) into exosomes to form an Exo/siRNA compound. The Exo/siRNA compound efficiently delivered the target siRNA into HMVECs causing selective gene silencing, inhibiting the ICAM-1 protein expression, and PMN-EC adhesion induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These data suggest that huiPSCs exosomes could be used as a natural gene delivery vector to transport therapeutic siRNAs for alleviating inflammatory responses in recipient cells.

Mol Neurodegener	2017	BACKGROUND: Tau pathology in AD spreads in a hierarchical pattern, whereby it first appears in the entorhinal cortex, then spreads to the hippocampus and later to the surrounding areas. Based on this sequential appearance, AD can be classified into six stages ("Braak stages"). The mechanisms and agents underlying the progression of Tau pathology are a matter of debate. Emerging evidence indicates that the propagation of Tau pathology may be due to the transmission of Tau protein, but the underlying pathways and Tau species are not well understood. In this study we investigated the question of Tau spreading via small extracellular vesicles called exosomes. METHODS: Exosomes from different sources were analyzed by biochemical methods and electron microscopy (EM) and cryo-EM. Microfluidic devices that allow the culture of cell populations in different compartments were used to investigate the spreading of Tau. RESULTS: We show that Tau protein is released by cultured primary neurons or by N2a cells overexpressing different Tau constructs via exosomes. Neuron-derived exosomal Tau is hypo-phosphorylated, compared with cytosolic Tau. Depolarization of neurons promotes release of Tau-containing exosomes, highlighting the importance of neuronal activity. Using microfluidic devices we show that exosomes mediate trans-neuronal transfer of Tau depending on synaptic connectivity. Tau spreading is achieved by direct transmission of exosomes between neurons. In organotypic hippocampal slices, Tau-containing exosomes in conditioned medium are taken up by neurons and microglia, not astrocytes. In N2a cells, Tau assemblies are released via exosomes. They can induce inclusions of other Tau molecules in N2a cells expressing mutant human Tau. We also studied exosomes from cerebrospinal fluid in AD and control subjects containing monomeric and oligomeric Tau. Split-luciferase complementation reveals that exosomes from CSF can promote Tau aggregation in cultured cells. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that exosomes contribute to trans-synaptic Tau transmission, and thus offer new approches to control the spreading of pathology in AD and other tauopathies.

Exosomes confer chemoresistance to pancreatic cancer cells by promoting ROS detoxification and miR-155-mediated suppression of key gemcitabine-metabolising enzyme, DCK.	Br J Cancer	2017	BACKGROUND: Chemoresistance is a significant clinical problem in pancreatic cancer (PC) and underlying molecular mechanisms still remain to be completely understood. Here we report a novel exosome-mediated mechanism of drug-induced acquired chemoresistance in PC cells. METHODS: Differential ultracentrifugation was performed to isolate extracellular vesicles (EVs) based on their size from vehicle- or gemcitabine-treated PC cells. Extracellular vesicles size and subtypes were determined by dynamic light scattering and marker profiling, respectively. Gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR and/or immunoblot analyses, and direct targeting of DCK by miR-155 was confirmed by dual-luciferase 3'-UTR reporter assay. Flow cytometry was performed to examine the apoptosis indices and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in PC cells using specific dyes. Cell viability was determined using the WST-1 assay. RESULTS: Conditioned media (CM) from gemcitabine-treated PC cells (Gem-CM) provided significant chemoprotection to subsequent gemcitabine toxicity and most of the chemoresistance conferred by Gem-CM resulted from its EVs fraction. Sub-fractionation grouped EVs into distinct subtypes based on size distribution and marker profiles, and exosome (Gem-Exo) was the only sub-fraction that imparted chemoresistance. Gene expression analyses demonstrated upregulation of SOD2 and CAT (ROS-detoxifying genes), and downregulation of DCK (gemcitabine-metabolising gene) in Gem-Exo-treated cells. SOD/CAT upregulation resulted, at least in part, from exosome-mediated transfer of their transcripts and they suppressed basal and gemcitabine-induced ROS production, and partly promoted chemoresistance. DCK downregulation occurred through exosome-delivered miR-155 and either the functional suppression of miR-155 or restoration of DCK led to marked abrogation of Gem-Exo-mediated chemoresistance. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings establish a novel role of exosomes in mediating the acquired chemoresistance of PC.	PMC5344296

Electronic address: .	goffredo.arena@mcgill.ca		Transfer of malignant traits as opposed to migration of cells: A novel concept to explain metastatic disease.	Med Hypotheses	2017	Metastatic disease is believed to develop following dissemination of cells to target organs. Inability of this theory to effectively explain certain phenomena such as patterns of metastatic spread, late metastasis formation, different gene patterns between primary cancer and metastasis have brought forward the need for alternative models. Recent discoveries have strengthened the validity of theories supporting a humoral transfer of malignant traits as opposed to migration of malignant cells to explain metastatic disease in cancer patients. In light of this new evidence, we would like to highlight a model that offers a new perspective to explain cancer metastasis. In the system that we theorize, genetic material released by cancer cells would travel, either free or packed in exosomes, through the blood. Target cells located in organs deriving from the same embryological layer might uptake this genetic material due to expression of specific receptors. Interplay with the immune system would determine the fate of these oncofactors and would regulate their ability to circulate in the blood, integrate in the genome and be transcribed. We also hypothesize that the expression of cell membrane receptors such as integrins, to which cancer exosomes ligate might be mediated by inherited or acquired oncosuppressor mutations.

Neurotox Res	2017	This study aimed to investigate the neurotoxicity of exosomes to cultured neuroblastoma and neurons in vitro and to mature and newborn neurons in the hippocampus in vivo. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that exosomes, small membranous vesicles secreted from many cell types, contain pathogenic proteins including full-length amyloid precursor protein (flAPP) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolites. However, the function of these exosomes in Alzheimer disease (AD) has not been much explored. In the present study, exosomes were harvested from the conditioned medium of HEK293-APP Swe/Ind cells and injected into the hippocampal dentate gyrus region via a stereotactic method to detect their effects on the neuronal survival in vivo. These exosomes containing pathogenic proteins showed high neurotoxicity and could impair neurogenesis in the hippocampus. The data demonstrated that exosomes secreted from sick cells might damage neurogenesis and promote disease progression in AD.

Cell Commun Signal	2017	BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancers (CRCs) that lack DNA mismatch repair function exhibit the microsatellite unstable (MSI) phenotype and are characterized by the accumulation of frameshift mutations at short repetitive DNA sequences (microsatellites). These tumors recurrently show inactivating frameshift mutations in the tumor suppressor Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor Type 2 (TGFBR2) thereby abrogating downstream signaling. How altered TGFBR2 signaling affects exosome-mediated communication between MSI tumor cells and their environment has not been resolved. Here, we report on molecular alterations of exosomes shed by MSI cells and the biological response evoked in recipient cells. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated and characterized by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking, and western blot analysis. TGFBR2-dependent effects on the cargo and functions of exosomes were studied in a MSI CRC model cell line enabling reconstituted and inducible TGFBR2 expression and signaling. Microsatellite frameshift mutations in exosomal and cellular DNA were examined by PCR-based DNA fragment analysis and exosomal protein profiles were identified by mass spectrometry. Uptake of fluorescent-labeled exosomes by hepatoma recipient cells was monitored by confocal microscopy. TGFBR2-dependent exosomal effects on secreted cytokine levels of recipient cells were analyzed by Luminex technology and ELISA. RESULTS: Frameshift mutation patterns in microsatellite stretches of TGFBR2 and other MSI target genes were found to be reflected in the cargo of MSI CRC-derived exosomes. At the proteome level, reconstituted TGFBR2 expression and signaling uncovered two protein subsets exclusively occurring in exosomes derived from TGFBR2-deficient (14 proteins) or TGFBR2-proficient (five proteins) MSI donor cells. Uptake of these exosomes by recipient cells caused increased secretion (2-6 fold) of specific cytokines (Interleukin-4, Stem Cell Factor, Platelet-derived Growth Factor-B), depending on the TGFBR2 expression status of the tumor cell. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the coding MSI phenotype of DNA mismatch repair-deficient CRC cells is maintained in their exosomal DNA. Moreover, we uncovered that a recurrent MSI tumor driver mutation like TGFBR2 can reprogram the protein content of MSI cell-derived exosomes and in turn modulate the cytokine secretion profile of recipient cells. Apart from its diagnostic potential, these TGFBR2-dependent exosomal molecular and proteomic signatures might help to understand the signaling routes used by MSI tumors. Fricke et al. uncovered coding microsatellite instability-associated mutations of colorectal tumor driver genes like TGFBR2 in MSI tumor cellderived exosomes. Depending on the TGFBR2 expression status of their donor cells, shed exosomes show distinct proteomic signatures and promote altered cytokine secretion profiles in recipient cells.	PMC5379773

An integrated double-filtration microfluidic device for isolation, enrichment and quantification of urinary extracellular vesicles for detection of bladder cancer.	Sci Rep	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are present in a variety of bodily fluids, and the concentration of these sub-cellular vesicles and their associated biomarkers (proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids) can be used to aid clinical diagnosis. Although ultracentrifugation is commonly used for isolation of EVs, it is highly time-consuming, labor-intensive and instrument-dependent for both research laboratories and clinical settings. Here, we developed an integrated double-filtration microfluidic device that isolated and enriched EVs with a size range of 30-200 nm from urine, and subsequently quantified the EVs via a microchip ELISA. Our results showed that the concentration of urinary EVs was significantly elevated in bladder cancer patients (n = 16) compared to healthy controls (n = 8). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that this integrated EV double-filtration device had a sensitivity of 81.3% at a specificity of 90% (16 bladder cancer patients and 8 healthy controls). Thus, this integrated device has great potential to be used in conjunction with urine cytology and cystoscopy to improve clinical diagnosis of bladder cancer in clinics and at point-of-care (POC) settings.

J Transl Med	2017	BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health concern and its diagnosis is challenging due to the limitations in the specificity and sensitivity of the current diagnostic tests. Exosomes are bioactive 30-100 nm vesicles produced by most cell types and are found in almost all human body fluids. Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) can transfer biological information between cells and tissues and may act as potential biomarkers in many diseases. In this pilot study, we assessed the miRNA profile of exosomes released from human monocyte-derived macrophages upon infection with Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). METHODS: Human monocytes were obtained from the peripheral blood of three healthy subjects and driven to a monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) phenotype using standard protocols. MDMs were infected with BCG or left uninfected as control. 72 h post-infection, exosomes were collected from the cell culture medium, RNA was isolated and RNA-seq performed. The raw reads were filtered to eliminate adaptor and primer sequences and the sequences were run against the mature human miRNA sequences available in miRBase. MicroRNAs were identified using an E value <0.01. miRNA network analysis was performed using the DIANA miRNA tool, miRDB and functional KEGG pathway analysis. RESULTS: Infection of MDMs with BCG leads to the release of several exosomal miRNAs. These included miR-1224, -1293, -425, -4467, -4732, -484, -5094, -6848-6849, -4488 and -96 all of which were predicted to target metabolism and energy production-related pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for the release of specific exosomal miRNAs from BCG-infected MDMs. These exosomal miRNAs reflect host-pathogen interaction and subversion of host metabolic processes following infection.

Suppression of endothelial cell migration by tumor associated macrophage-derived exosomes is reversed by epithelial ovarian cancer exosomal lncRNA.	Cancer Cell Int	2017	OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism by which epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)-derived exosomes restore the migration of endothelial cells that is suppressed by TAM-derived exosomes. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from TAMs in the ascites of patients with EOC. The effect of exosomes on the expression of endothelial cell miRNA was monitored by PCR. The miRNA mimics were transfected to explore their effects. Microarray data and literature searches were used to predict target genes and the impact of target gene pathways, and small interfering RNA was used to target these genes. We used migration assays to determine whether ovarian cancer cell-derived exosomes participate in the regulation of TAMs and endothelial cells. We used microarray data to identify the target lncRNA, and we constructed target lncRNA expression plasmids to validate targets by Western blotting. RESULTS: We separated TAMs from the ascites of patients with EOC and isolated exosomes from TAM supernatants. After co-culture with HUVECs, these exosomes were efficiently incorporated into HUVECs. The migration of HUVECs was suppressed significantly in the exosome group compared with blank controls (P < 0.05).The miRNA mimic transfection and target gene prediction found that TAM-derived exosomes targeted the miR-146b-5p/TRAF6/NF-κB/MMP2 pathway to suppress endothelial cell migration; this result was supported by PCR and Western blotting analyses. The expression of exosomal miR-146b-5p isolated from serum in the EOC group was significantly increased compared to healthy individuals. Finally, TAM-derived exosomes and EOC SKOV3-derived exosomes in combination stimulated HUVEC cells and overcame the inhibition of endothelial cell migration caused by TAM-derived exosomes. Two lncRNAs that were carried by SKOV3-derived exosomes were identified as NF-κB pathway-associated genes by Western blotting. CONCLUSION: TAM-derived exosomes can inhibit the migration of endothelial cells by targeting the miR-146b-5p/TRAF6/NF-kB/MMP2 pathway. However, EOC-derived exosomes can transfer lncRNAs to remotely reverse this effect of TAMs on endothelial cells.	PMC5461704

Mol Reprod Dev	2017	Blood-borne extracellular vesicles (i.e., exosomes and microvesicles) carrying microRNAs (miRNAs) could make excellent biomarkers of disease and different physiologic states, including pregnancy status. We tested the hypothesis that circulating extracellular vesicle-derived miRNAs might differentiate the pregnancy status of cows that had maintained pregnancy to Day 30 from non-pregnant cows or from those that exhibited embryonic mortality between Days 17 and 30 of gestation. Cows were randomly assigned for artificial insemination with fertile semen (n = 36) or dead semen (n = 8; control group) on Day 0 (day of estrus). Blood was collected from all animals on Day 0 and on Days 17 and 24 after artificial insemination. Cows receiving live sperm were retrospectively classified as pregnant on Day 30 (n = 17) or exhibiting embryonic mortality between Days 17 and 30 (n = 19). Extracellular vesicles from Day 17 and 24 samples were isolated from serum using ultra-centrifugation, and their presence was confirmed by nanoparticle tracking and Western blot analyses (for CD81) prior to RNA extraction. MicroRNA sequencing was performed on pregnant, embryonic-mortality, and control cows (n = 4 per day), for a total of 24 independent reactions. In total, 214 miRNAs were identified in serum, 40 of which were novel. Based on differential abundance parameters, we identified 32 differentially abundant loci, representing 27 differentially abundant mature miRNA. At Days 17 and 24, specific miRNAs (e.g., miR-25, -16b, and -3596) were identified that differentiated the pregnancy status. In summary, we identified several circulating extracellular vesicles derived miRNAs that differ in abundance between embryonic mortality and pregnant cows.	PMC5580359

Cell-derived Exosomes as Promising Carriers for Drug Delivery and Targeted Therapy.	Curr Cancer Drug Targets	2018	Exosomes are small vesicles that are secreted by various types of cells, known to mediate signal transduction between cells. During recent years, novel carriers for the delivery of targeted drugs, chemotherapy drugs and RNAs are under development, which is believed to be beneficial for patients. Considering issues of drug nano-formulations in bloodstream, such as nano-toxicity and rapid clearance by mononuclear phagocyte system, exosomes derived from either patient's cells or bodyfluids, seem to be an optimal option. This review presents the current patterns of drug-loaded into exosomes and discusses how exosomes were reconstructed for targeted therapy. Loading either exosomes directly or their donor cells is an alternative, including incubation, electroporation, transfection of exosomes or transfection, incubation, activation of the parent cells. To solve the low efficiency of cargo loading into exosomes, protein loading via optically reversible protein-protein interaction can realize a novel exosomal protein carrier. In addition, targeted therapeutics with exosomes is achieved by three means, via adding targeting peptides into the surface of exosomes, by transferring specific genes within exosomes into tumors to establish a therapeutic target and, lastly, by targeting at exosomes containing tumor associated antigens. Nevertheless, purification and mass production of exosomes need further exploration, as well as more approaches were applied to targeted therapy. Therefore, exosomes could serve as an effective tool for drug delivery and targeted therapy.

Immunoaffinity based methods are superior to kits for purification of prostate derived extracellular vesicles from plasma samples.	Prostate	2017	BACKGROUND: The ability to isolate extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes or microparticles is an important method that is currently not standardized. While commercially available kits offer purification of EVs from biofluids, such purified EV samples will also contain non-EV entities such as soluble protein and nucleic acids that could confound subsequent experimentation. Ideally, only EVs would be isolated and no soluble protein would be present in the final EV preparation. METHODS: We compared commercially available EV isolation kits with immunoaffinity purification techniques and evaluated our final EV preparations using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and nanoscale flow cytometry (NFC). AFM is the only modality capable of detecting distinguishing soluble protein from EVs which is important for downstream proteomics approaches. NFC is the only technique capable of quantitating the proportion of target EVs to non-target EVs in the final EV preparation. RESULTS: To determine enrichment of prostate derived EVs relative to non-target MPs, anti-PSMA (Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen) antibodies were used in NFC. Antibody-based immunoaffinity purification generated the highest quality of prostate derived EV preparations due to the lack of protein and RNA present in the samples. All kits produced poor purity EV preparations that failed to deplete the sample of plasma protein. CONCLUSIONS: While attractive due to their ease of use, EV purification kits do not provide substantial improvements in isolation of EVs from biofluids such as plasma. Immunoaffinity approaches are more efficient and economical and will also eliminate a significant portion of plasma proteins which is necessary for downstream approaches.

Exosomes secreted by cardiomyocytes subjected to ischaemia promote cardiac angiogenesis.	Cardiovasc Res	2017	Aims: Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and results from an obstruction in the blood supply to a region of the heart. In an attempt to replenish oxygen and nutrients to the deprived area, affected cells release signals to promote the development of new vessels and confer protection against MI. However, the mechanisms underlying the growth of new vessels in an ischaemic scenario remain poorly understood. Here, we show that cardiomyocytes subjected to ischaemia release exosomes that elicit an angiogenic response of endothelial cells (ECs). Methods and results: Exosomes secreted by H9c2 myocardial cells and primary cardiomyocytes, cultured either in control or ischaemic conditions were isolated and added to ECs. We show that ischaemic exosomes, in comparison with control exosomes, confer protection against oxidative-induced lesion, promote proliferation, and sprouting of ECs, stimulate the formation of capillary-like structures and strengthen adhesion complexes and barrier properties. Moreover, ischaemic exosomes display higher levels of metalloproteases (MMP) and promote the secretion of MMP by ECs. We demonstrate that miR-222 and miR-143, the relatively most abundant miRs in ischaemic exosomes, partially recapitulate the angiogenic effect of exosomes. Additionally, we show that ischaemic exosomes stimulate the formation of new functional vessels in vivo using in ovo and Matrigel plug assays. Finally, we demonstrate that intramyocardial delivery of ischaemic exosomes improves neovascularization following MI. Conclusions: This study establishes that exosomes secreted by cardiomyocytes under ischaemic conditions promote heart angiogenesis, which may pave the way towards the development of add-on therapies to enhance myocardial blood supply.

Human Endothelial Progenitor Cell-Derived Exosomes Increase Proliferation and Angiogenesis in Cardiac Fibroblasts by Promoting the Mesenchymal-Endothelial Transition and Reducing High Mobility Group Box 1 Protein B1 Expression.	DNA Cell Biol	2017	Myocardial fibrosis is a characteristic feature of cardiomyopathies. However, no effective strategies to attenuate cardiac fibrosis are currently available. Late-stage endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are precursors of endothelial cells (ECs) that repair the heart through a paracrine mechanism. In the present study, we tested whether EPC-derived exosomes regulate the differentiation of fibroblasts into ECs. We isolated late-stage EPCs from human peripheral blood (PB) and used immunofluorescence and flow cytometry to confirm their identity. Next, we isolated exosomes from the EPCs and characterized their morphology using electron microscopy and confirmed the expression of exosome-specific marker proteins using Western blots. We then investigated the in vitro effects of exosomes on the proliferation and angiogenesis of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and on the expression of the mesenchymal-endothelial transition (MEndT)-related genes and the myocardial fibrosis-regulated protein, high mobility group box 1 protein B1 (HMGB1). We found that human PB-EPC-derived exosomes enhanced the proliferation and angiogenesis of CFs in vitro. Furthermore, CFs stimulated with these exosomes showed increased expression of the EC-specific markers, like cluster of differentiation 31 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and decreased expression of proteins involved in fibrosis, like alpha-smooth muscle actin, vimentin, collagen I, transforming growth factor-beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In addition, CFs stimulated with human PB-EPC-derived exosomes, inhibited the expression of HMGB1. Taken together, our study demonstrated that EPC-derived exosomes promote the proliferation and angiogenesis of CFs by inhibiting MEndT and decreasing the expression of HMGB1.

Stem Cell Res Ther	2017	BACKGROUND: The therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be attributed partly to humoral factors such as growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. Human term placental tissue-derived MSCs (PlaMSCs), or conditioned medium left over from cultures of these cells, have been reported to enhance angiogenesis. Recently, the exosome, which can transport a diverse suite of macromolecules, has gained attention as a novel intercellular communication tool. However, the potential role of the exosome in PlaMSC therapeutic action is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PlaMSC-derived exosome angiogenesis promotion in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: MSCs were isolated from human term placental tissue by enzymatic digestion. Conditioned medium was collected after 48-h incubation in serum-free medium (PlaMSC-CM). Angiogenic factors present in PlaMSC-CM were screened by a growth factor array. Exosomes were prepared by ultracentrifugation of PlaMSC-CM, and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and western blot analyses. The proangiogenic activity of PlaMSC-derived exosomes (PlaMSC-exo) was assessed using an endothelial tube formation assay, a cell migration assay, and reverse transcription-PCR analysis. The in-vivo angiogenic activity of PlaMSC-exo was evaluated using a murine auricle ischemic injury model. RESULTS: PlaMSC-CM contained both angiogenic and angiostatic factors, which enhanced endothelial tube formation. PlaMSC-exo were incorporated into endothelial cells; these exosomes stimulated both endothelial tube formation and migration, and enhanced angiogenesis-related gene expression. Laser Doppler blood flow analysis showed that PlaMSC-exo infusion also enhanced angiogenesis in an in-vivo murine auricle ischemic injury model. CONCLUSIONS: PlaMSC-exo enhanced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that exosomes play a role in the proangiogenic activity of PlaMSCs. PlaMSC-exo may be a novel therapeutic approach for treating ischemic diseases.	PMC5627451

J Control Release	2017	PURPOSE: Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (30-100nm in diameter) secreted by cells into extracellular space. The present study evaluated the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on exosome production and/or release, and quantified the contribution of exosomes to intercellular drug transfer and pharmacodynamics. METHODS: Human cancer cells (breast MCF7, breast-to-lung metastatic LM2, ovarian A2780 and OVCAR4) were treated with paclitaxel (PTX, 2-1000nM) or doxorubicin (DOX, 20-1000nM) for 24-48h. Exosomes were isolated from the culture medium of drug-treated donor cells (Donor cells) using ultra-centrifugation, and analyzed for acetylcholinesterase activity, total proteins, drug concentrations, and biological effects (cytotoxicity and anti-migration) on drug-naïve recipient cells (Recipient cells). These results were used to develop computational predictive quantitative pharmacology models. RESULTS: Cells in exponential growth phase released ~220 exosomes/cell in culture medium. PTX and DOX significantly promoted exosome production and/or release in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with greater effects in ovarian cancer cells than in breast cancer cells. Exosomes isolated from Donor cells contained appreciable drug levels (2-7pmole/106 cells after 24h treatment with 100-1000nM PTX), and caused cytotoxicity and inhibited migration of Recipient cells. Quantitative pharmacology models that integrated cellular PTX pharmacokinetics with PTX pharmacodynamics successfully predicted effects of exosomes on intercellular drug transfer, cytotoxicity of PTX on Donor cells and cytotoxicity of PTX-containing exosomes on Recipient cells. Additional model simulations indicate that within clinically achievable PTX concentrations, the contribution of exosomes to active drug efflux increased with drug concentration and exceeded the p-glycoprotein efflux when the latter was saturated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate (a) chemotherapeutic agents stimulate exosome production or release, and (b) exosome is a mechanism of intercellular drug transfer that contributes to pharmacodynamics of neighboring cells.

Proteomic Profiling of Exosomes Secreted by Breast Cancer Cells with Varying Metastatic Potential.	Proteomics	2017	Cancer cells actively release extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, into the surrounding microenvironment. Exosomes play pleiotropic roles in cancer progression and metastasis, including invasion, angiogenesis, and immune modulation. However, the proteome profile of exosomes isolated from cells with different metastatic potential and the role of these exosomes in driving metastasis remains unclear. Here, we conduct a comparative proteomic analysis of exosomes isolated from several genetically related mouse breast tumor lines with different metastatic propensity. The amount of exosomes produced and the extent of cancer-associated protein cargo vary significantly between nonmetastatic and metastatic cell-derived exosomes. Metastatic cell-derived exosomes contain proteins that promote migration, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis while the nonmetastatic cell-derived exosomes contain proteins involved in cell-cell/cell-matrix adhesion and polarity maintenance. The metastatic exosomes contain a distinct set of membrane proteins including Ceruloplasmin and Metadherin which could presumably aid in targeting the primary cancer cells to specific metastatic sites. Hence, it can be concluded that the exosomes contain different protein cargo based on the host cells metastatic properties and can facilitate in the dissemination of the primary tumors to distant sites.

Pediatric brain tumor cells release exosomes with a miRNA repertoire that differs from exosomes secreted by normal cells.	Oncotarget	2017	High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are very aggressive brain tumors with a cancer stem cell component. Cells, including cancer stem cells, release vesicles called exosomes which contain small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs). These are thought to play an important role in cell-cell communication. However, we have limited knowledge of the types of exosomal miRNAs released by pediatric HGG stem cells; a prerequisite for exploring their potential roles in HGG biology. Here we isolated exosomes released by pediatric glioma stem cells (GSCs) and compared their repertoire of miRNAs to genetically normal neural stem cells (NSCs) exosomes, as well as their respective cellular miRNA content. Whereas cellular miRNAs are similar, we find that the exosomal miRNA profiles differ between normal and tumor cells, and identify several differentially expressed miRNAs. Of particular interest is miR-1290 and miR-1246, which have previously been linked to 'stemness' and invasion in other cancers. We demonstrate that GSC-secreted exosomes influence the gene expression of receiving NSCs, particularly targeting genes with a role in cell fate and tumorigenesis. Thus, our study shows that GSCs and NSCs have similar cellular miRNA profiles, yet differ significantly in the repertoire of exosomal miRNAs and these could influence malignant features of HGG.

Exosomal MicroRNA MiR-1246 Promotes Cell Proliferation, Invasion and Drug Resistance by Targeting CCNG2 in Breast Cancer.	Cell Physiol Biochem	2017	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Treatment of breast cancer remains a clinical challenge. This study aims to validate exosomal microRNA-1246 (miR-1246) as a serum biomarker for breast cancer and understand the underlying mechanism in breast cancer progression. METHODS: The expression levels of endogenous and exosomal miRNAs were examined by real time PCR, and the expression level of the target protein was detected by western blot. Scanning electron and confocal microscopy were used to characterize exosomes and to study their uptake and transfer. Luciferase reporter plasmids and its mutant were used to confirm direct targeting. Furthermore, the functional significance of exosomal miR-1246 was estimated by invasion assay and cell viability assay. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that exosomes carrying microRNA can be transferred among different cell lines through direct uptake. miR-1246 is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells compared to non-metastatic breast cancer cells or non-malignant breast cells. Moreover, miR-1246 can suppress the expression level of its target gene, Cyclin-G2 (CCNG2), indicating its functional significance. Finally, treatment with exosomes derived from MDA-MB-231 cells could enhance the viability, migration and chemotherapy resistance of non-malignant HMLE cells. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our results support an important role of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs in regulating breast tumor progression, which highlights their potential for applications in miRNA-based therapeutics.

Exosomes from human umbilical cord blood accelerate cutaneous wound healing through miR-21-3p-mediated promotion of angiogenesis and fibroblast function.	Theranostics	2018	The application of blood plasma for soft tissue wound healing is receiving much more attention recently. Exosomes are critical paracrine mediators that can be obtained from biological fluids including plasma and be able to induce regenerative effects by transferring bioactive molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs). This study aimed to investigate the effects of exosomes from human umbilical cord blood plasma (UCB-Exos) on wound healing and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Methods: UCB-Exos were isolated by ultracentrifugation and subcutaneously injected into full-thickness skin wounds in mice. The efficacy of UCB-Exos on wound healing was evaluated by measuring wound closure rates, histological analysis and immunofluorescence examinations. In vitro, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to detect the expression levels of a class of miRNAs that have positive roles in regulating wound healing. The scratch wound assay, transwell assay and cell counting kit-8 analysis were conducted to assess the effects of UCB-Exos on migration and proliferation of human skin fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Tube formation assay was carried out to test the impact of UCB-Exos on angiogenic tube formation ability of endothelial cells. Meanwhile, by using specific RNA inhibitors or siRNAs, the roles of the candidate miRNA and its target genes in UCB-Exos-induced regulation of function of fibroblasts and endothelial cells were assessed. Results: The local transplantation of UCB-Exos into mouse skin wounds resulted in accelerated re-epithelialization, reduced scar widths, and enhanced angiogenesis. In vitro, UCB-Exos could promote the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts, and enhance the angiogenic activities of endothelial cells. Notably, miR-21-3p was found to be highly enriched in UCB-Exos and served as a critical mediator in UCB-Exos -induced regulatory effects through inhibition of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and sprouty homolog 1 (SPRY1). Conclusion: Our results suggest that UCB-Exos are important effectors of plasma activity and can be used as a novel promising strategy for soft tissue wound healing.	PMC5743467

Cell	2018	Arc/Arg3.1 is required for synaptic plasticity and cognition, and mutations in this gene are linked to autism and schizophrenia. Arc bears a domain resembling retroviral/retrotransposon Gag-like proteins, which multimerize into a capsid that packages viral RNA. The significance of such a domain in a plasticity molecule is uncertain. Here, we report that the Drosophila Arc1 protein forms capsid-like structures that bind darc1 mRNA in neurons and is loaded into extracellular vesicles that are transferred from motorneurons to muscles. This loading and transfer depends on the darc1-mRNA 3' untranslated region, which contains retrotransposon-like sequences. Disrupting transfer blocks synaptic plasticity, suggesting that transfer of dArc1 complexed with its mRNA is required for this function. Notably, cultured cells also release extracellular vesicles containing the Gag region of the Copia retrotransposon complexed with its own mRNA. Taken together, our results point to a trans-synaptic mRNA transport mechanism involving retrovirus-like capsids and extracellular vesicles.	PMC5793882

Clin Exp Nephrol	2018	BACKGROUND: AQP2 water channel is critical for urinary concentration in the kidney. Interestingly, AQP2 is abundantly excreted in the urine as extracellular vesicles (EVs), which is known to be a useful biomarker for water-balance disorders although the character of AQP2-enriched EVs is poorly understood including water channel function. METHODS: Human urine EVs were obtained by a differential centrifugation method. AQP2-bearing EVs were isolated by immunoprecipitation with an AQP2-specific antibody, and the proteins in the EVs were analyzed by LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis. Osmotic water permeability (Pf) of the AQP2-rich EVs was measured by a stopped-flow method monitoring scattered light intensity in response to outwardly directed osmotic gradient. RESULTS: Sequential centrifugation of human urine showed that AQP2 was present predominantly (80%) in low-density EVs (160,000 g), whereas negligible amount in high-density EVs (17,000 g). Proteomic analysis of the AQP2-bearing EVs identified 137 proteins, mostly in the endosome pathway, including the components of ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required transporter)-I, II, III. Pf value of the 160,000 g EVs was 4.75 ± 0.38 × 10-4 cm s-1 (mean ± SE) with the activation energy of 3.51 kcal mol-1 which was inhibited with 0.3 mM HgCl2 by 63%, suggesting a channel-mediated water transport. Moreover, Pf value showed a significant correlation with the abundance of AQP2 protein in EVs. CONCLUSION: Taken together, AQP2 is localized predominantly to urinary exosomes with preserved water channel activities.

Sci Rep	2018	The toxicological mechanisms of liver injury caused by most traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) remain largely unknown. Due to the unique features, exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are currently attracting major interests to provide further insights into toxicological mechanisms. Thus, taking Fructus Meliae Toosendan as an example of hepatoxic TCM, this study aimed to elucidate its hepatotoxicity mechanisms through profiling miRNAs in circulating exosomes of Fructus Meliae Toosendan water extract (FMT)-exposed mice. Biological pathway analysis of the 64 differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs (DEMs) showed that hepatic dysfunction induced by FMT likely related to apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell cycle dysregulation. Integrated analysis of serum exosomal DEMs and hepatic differentially expressed mRNAs further enriched oxidative stress and apoptosis related pathways. In vitro validation studies for omics results suggested that FMT-induced DNA damage was mediated by generating intracellular reactive oxygen species, leading to cell apoptosis through p53-dependent mitochondrial damage and S-phase arrest. Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response was activated to protect liver cells. Moreover, serum exosomal miR-370-3p, the most down-regulated miRNA involving in these pathways, might be the momentous event in aggravating cytotoxic effect of FMT by elevating p21 and Cyclin E. In conclusion, circulating exosomal miRNAs profiling could contribute to deepen the understanding of TCM-induced hepatotoxicity.	PMC5809479

Breast cancer cell-derived exosomes and macrophage polarization are associated with lymph node metastasis.	Oncotarget	2018	Crosstalk between breast cancer and macrophages has potential implications for tumor metastasis. This study investigates macrophage polarization induced by triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell-derived exosomes that promote lymph node (LN) metastasis in orthotopic TNBC models. The MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line expressing the exosomal CD63-red fluorescence (RFP) fusion protein was generated to noninvasively visualize exosome transfer into cancer cells and macrophages. Administration of RFP-tagged exosomes enhanced migration of macrophages and induced macrophage polarization in vitro. In orthotopic TNBC models, noninvasive bioluminescent imaging, ultrasound-guided photoacoustic imaging, and histological analysis revealed that intravenous injection of RFP-tagged exosomes promoted primary tumor growth and axillary LN metastasis in which expression of CD206, a marker or alternatively activated type 2 (M2) macrophages, was significantly higher than expression of NOS2, a marker of classically activated type 1 (M1) macrophages. These results suggest breast cancer cell-derived exosomes stimulate macrophage polarization that creates favorable conditions for LN metastatic processes in TNBC.	PMC5800911

Basic Res Cardiol	2018	Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), the phenomenon whereby brief ischemic episodes in distant tissues or organs render the heart resistant to infarction, has been exhaustively demonstrated in preclinical models. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that exosomes play a requisite role in conveying the cardioprotective signal from remote tissue to the myocardium. However, in cohorts displaying clinically common comorbidities-in particular, type-2 diabetes-the infarct-sparing effect of RIPC may be confounded for as-yet unknown reasons. To investigate this issue, we used an integrated in vivo and in vitro approach to establish whether: (1) the efficacy of RIPC is maintained in the Zucker fatty rat model of type-2 diabetes, (2) the humoral transfer of cardioprotective triggers initiated by RIPC are transported via exosomes, and (3) diabetes is associated with alterations in exosome-mediated communication. We report that a standard RIPC stimulus (four 5-min episodes of hindlimb ischemia) reduced infarct size in normoglycemic Zucker lean rats, but failed to confer protection in diabetic Zucker fatty animals. Moreover, we provide novel evidence, via transfer of serum and serum fractions obtained following RIPC and applied to HL-1 cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation, that diabetes was accompanied by impaired humoral communication of cardioprotective signals. Specifically, our data revealed that serum and exosome-rich serum fractions collected from normoglycemic rats attenuated hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced HL-1 cell death, while, in contrast, exosome-rich samples from Zucker fatty rats did not evoke protection in the HL-1 cell model. Finally, and unexpectedly, we found that exosome-depleted serum from Zucker fatty rats was cytotoxic and exacerbated hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced cardiomyocyte death.

Neuroscience	2018	The aims of this study were to examine the levels of serum and exosomal miR-137, miR-155 and miR-223, three neuroinflammation-related miRNAs, in dementia patients and to explore the value of these miRNAs for the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of dementia. Thirty-two patients with dementia were enrolled, and sixteen volunteers without dementia served as controls. Serum exosomes were isolated by precipitation with ExoQuick and characterized by western blotting, nanoparticle-tracking analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. The levels of both total serum miRNAs and serum exosomal miRNAs were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Total serum miRNAs and serum exosomal miRNAs were both detected to be down-regulated. The median level of serum exosomal miR-223 was significantly decreased in dementia patients (p < 0.01). The level of miR-223 was significantly correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) spectral ratios and serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP. The diagnostic utility of exosomal miR-233 was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.875. This study suggests that serum exosomal miR-223 is a promising biomarker for diagnosing dementia and evaluating the progression of disease.

The Role for Exosomal microRNAs in Disruption of Regulatory T Cell Homeostasis in Multiple Sclerosis.	J Exp Neurosci	2018	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, in which myelin and oligodendrocytes are the main targets recognized by inflammatory CD4+ T cells reactive to myelin peptides. Regulatory CD4+ T (Treg) cells normally keep homeostasis of the immune system by inhibiting detrimental effects of inflammatory T cells. However, Treg cells are reduced in patients with MS for unknown reason. This commentary highlights a novel function of circulating exosomes to inhibit the differentiation of Treg cells in MS. Our recent work has demonstrated that the circulating exosomes, a member of extracellular vesicles, of patients with MS exert this effect by transferring let-7i to naive CD4+ T cells. The transferred let-7i subsequently causes a decreased expression of insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and transforming growth factor β receptor 1 (TGFBR1), leading to the inhibition of Treg cell differentiation. Thus, extrinsic microRNAs transferred by exosomes might have an active role in triggering autoimmune diseases. We hypothesize that extracellular vesicles including exosomes can be a communication tool between the gut microbiota and the host immune system. Further research in this area will expand the knowledge about the precise mechanism of autoimmune diseases and can lead to a new therapeutic approach.	PMC5881976

Biomed Environ Sci	2018	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between plasma miR-93-5p and the risk of esophageal cancer, as well as the influence of miR-93-5p on the biological function of esophageal cancer cells, exerted through exosomes. METHODS: The expression of plasma miR-93-5p in esophageal cancer patients and healthy controls was analysed by real-time quantitative PCR. The influence of miR-93-5p on the risk and prognosis of esophageal carcinoma was analyzed by conditional logistic regression and survival analysis. The effect of miR-93-5p on the biological function of recipient cells was investigated by establishing an in vitro donor cell co-culture model. The target gene of miR-93-5p was validated by luciferase reporter assay and Western Blotting. RESULTS: Upregulation of plasma miR-93-5p expression significantly increases the risk of esophageal cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. miR-93-5p transferred by exosomes promotes the proliferation of recipient esophageal cancer cells and affects the expression of PTEN and its downstream proteins p21 and cyclin D1. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a reference for the identification of biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of esophageal cancer.

BMC Cancer	2018	BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate that carries a cytotoxic drug (DM1) to HER2-positive cancer. The target of T-DM1 (HER2) is present also on cancer-derived exosomes. We hypothesized that exosome-bound T-DM1 may contribute to the activity of T-DM1. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from the cell culture medium of HER2-positive SKBR-3 and EFM-192A breast cancer cells, HER2-positive SNU-216 gastric cancer cells, and HER2-negative MCF-7 breast cancer cells by serial centrifugations including two ultracentrifugations, and treated with T-DM1. T-DM1 not bound to exosomes was removed using HER2-coated magnetic beads. Exosome samples were analyzed by electron microscopy, flow cytometry and Western blotting. Binding of T-DM1-containing exosomes to cancer cells and T-DM1 internalization were investigated with confocal microscopy. Effects of T-DM1-containg exosomes on cancer cells were investigated with the AlamarBlue cell proliferation assay and the Caspase-Glo 3/7 caspase activation assay. RESULTS: T-DM1 binds to exosomes derived from HER2-positive cancer cells, but not to exosomes derived from HER2-negative MCF-7 cells. HER2-positive SKBR-3 cells accumulated T-DM1 after being treated with T-DM1-containg exosomes, and treatment of SKBR-3 and EFM-192A cells with T-DM1-containing exosomes resulted in growth inhibition and activation of caspases 3 and/or 7. CONCLUSION: T-DM1 binds to exosomes derived from HER2-positive cancer cells, and T-DM1 may be carried to other cancer cells via exosomes leading to reduced viability of the recipient cells. The results suggest a new mechanism of action for T-DM1, mediated by exosomes derived from HER2-positive cancer.	PMC5930687

Microvesicles from Human Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells as a New Protective Strategy in Osteoarthritic Chondrocytes.	Cell Physiol Biochem	2018	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chronic inflammation contributes to cartilage degeneration during the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSC) show great potential to treat inflammatory and degradative processes in OA and have demonstrated paracrine effects in chondrocytes. In the present work, we have isolated and characterized the extracellular vesicles from human AD-MSC to investigate their role in the chondroprotective actions of these cells. METHODS: AD-MSC were isolated by collagenase treatment from adipose tissue from healthy individuals subjected to abdominal lipectomy surgery. Microvesicles and exosomes were obtained from conditioned medium by filtration and differential centrifugation. Chondrocytes from OA patients were used in primary culture and stimulated with 10 ng/ml interleukin(IL)-1β in the presence or absence of AD-MSC microvesicles, exosomes or conditioned medium. Protein expression was investigated by ELISA and immunofluorescence, transcription factor-DNA binding by ELISA, gene expression by real-time PCR, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by radioimmunoassay, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and nitric oxide (NO) production by fluorometry. RESULTS: In OA chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1β, microvesicles and exosomes reduced the production of inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, PGE2 and NO. The downregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 would lead to the decreased PGE2 production while the effect on NO could depend on the reduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. Treatment of OA chondrocytes with extracellular vesicles also decreased the release of MMP activity and MMP-13 expression whereas the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the expression of collagen II were significantly enhanced. The reduction of inflammatory and catabolic mediators could be the consequence of a lower activation of nuclear factor-κB and activator protein-1. The upregulation of annexin A1 specially in MV may contribute to the anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects of AD-MSC. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the interest of AD-MSC extracellular vesicles to develop new therapeutic approaches in joint conditions.

Exosomes bearing HLA-DR1 molecules need dendritic cells to efficiently stimulate specific T cells.	Int Immunol	2002	Exosomes are small vesicles (60-100 nm) secreted by various cell types upon the fusion of endosomal compartments with the plasma membrane. Exosomes from antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as B lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DC), bear MHC class II molecules. In addition, the injection of DC-derived exosomes was reported to elicit potent T cell responses in vivo. Here, we analyzed the activation of specific T cells by MHC class II-bearing exosomes in vitro. The rat mast cell line, RBL-2H3, was engineered to express human class II molecules uniformly loaded with an antigenic peptide [HLA-DR1-hemagglutinin (HA)]. These cells secreted exosomes bearing DR1 class II molecules upon stimulation by a calcium ionophore or IgE receptor cross-linking. Exosomes bearing DR1-HA(306-318) complexes activated HA/DR1-specific T cells only weakly, whereas the cross-linking of such exosomes to latex beads increased stimulation of specific T cells. By contrast, the incubation of free exosomes with DC resulted in the highly efficient stimulation of specific T cells. Thus, exosomes bearing MHC class II complexes must be taken up by professional APC for efficient T cell activation.

J Transl Med	2005	BACKGROUND: There is a continued need to develop more effective cancer immunotherapy strategies. Exosomes, cell-derived lipid vesicles that express high levels of a narrow spectrum of cell proteins represent a novel platform for delivering high levels of antigen in conjunction with costimulatory molecules. We performed this study to test the safety, feasibility and efficacy of autologous dendritic cell (DC)-derived exosomes (DEX) loaded with the MAGE tumor antigens in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: This Phase I study enrolled HLA A2+ patients with pre-treated Stage IIIb (N = 4) and IV (N = 9) NSCLC with tumor expression of MAGE-A3 or A4. Patients underwent leukapheresis to generate DC from which DEX were produced and loaded with MAGE-A3, -A4, -A10, and MAGE-3DPO4 peptides. Patients received 4 doses of DEX at weekly intervals. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled and 9 completed therapy. Three formulations of DEX were evaluated; all were well tolerated with only grade 1-2 adverse events related to the use of DEX (injection site reactions (N = 8), flu like illness (N = 1), and peripheral arm pain (N = 1)). The time from the first dose of DEX until disease progression was 30 to 429+ days. Three patients had disease progression before the first DEX dose. Survival of patients after the first DEX dose was 52-665+ days. DTH reactivity against MAGE peptides was detected in 3/9 patients. Immune responses were detected in patients as follows: MAGE-specific T cell responses in 1/3, increased NK lytic activity in 2/4. CONCLUSION: Production of the DEX vaccine was feasible and DEX therapy was well tolerated in patients with advanced NSCLC. Some patients experienced long term stability of disease and activation of immune effectors.	PMC551593

Abnormal disulfide-linked oligomerization results in ER retention and altered signaling by TNFR1 mutants in TNFR1-associated periodic fever syndrome (TRAPS).	Blood	2006	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is an autosomal dominant systemic autoinflammatory disease associated with heterozygous mutations in TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). Here we examined the structural and functional alterations caused by 9 distinct TRAPS-associated TNFR1 mutations in transfected cells and a mouse "knock-in" model of TRAPS. We found that these TNFR1 mutants did not generate soluble versions of the receptor, either through membrane cleavage or in exosomes. Mutant receptors did not bind TNF and failed to function as dominant-negative inhibitors of TNFR1-induced apoptosis. Instead, TRAPS mutant TNFR1 formed abnormal disulfide-linked oligomers that failed to interact with wild-type TNFR1 molecules through the preligand assembly domain (PLAD) that normally governs receptor self-association. TRAPS mutant TNFR1 molecules were retained intracellularly and colocalized with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. The capacity of mutant receptors to spontaneously induce both apoptosis and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity was reduced. In contrast, the R92Q variant of TNFR1 behaved like the wild-type receptor in all of these assays. The inflammatory phenotype of TRAPS may be due to consequences of mutant TNFR1 protein misfolding and ER retention.	PMC1895878

Identification of genes upregulated by recombinant interferon-alpha in HepG2 cells by suppressive subtractive hybridization analysis.	Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int	2007	BACKGROUND: Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is an important cytokine with multiple functions, but the target genes transactivated by IFN-alpha remain largely unknown. A study of such genes will help to understand the mechanism of function of IFN-alpha. To isolate the gene transcripts specifically upregulated by IFN-alpha in HepG2 cells, we conducted suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) analysis. METHODS: SSH was used to analyze the target genes transactivated by recombinant IFN-alpha protein, and a subtractive cDNA library was constructed from HepG2 cells treated with recombinant IFN-alpha (rIFN-alpha, 2000 IU/ml) for 16 hours as tester, and cells not treated with rIFN-alpha as driver. The SSH PCR products from the library were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector and with BLASTX, the positive clones were randomly selected, sequenced and compared to the database in GenBank of the 35 differentially expressed gene fragments from the library, 6 clones showed significant homology to other known proteins. RESULTS: The subtractive cDNA library of genes upregulated by IFN-alpha was constructed successfully. rIFN-alpha upregulated the expression of the RAN binding protein 5 (RANBP5), NADH dehydrogenase, exosome component 3 (EXOSC3), zinc finger RNA binding protein, Dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1) and acetyl-coenzyme A acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that rIFN-alpha can upregulate the expression of important genes to exert its functions, and provide new clues for discovering the molecular mechanisms of action of IFN-alpha.

Dendritic cells derived from bone marrow cells fail to acquire and present major histocompatibility complex antigens from other dendritic cells.	Immunology	2008	Dendritic cells stimulate primary T-cell responses and a major activation route is via presentation of antigens pre-processed by other dendritic cells. This presentation of pre-processed antigens most likely proceeds through transfer of functional major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens through exosomes, 'live nibbling' or apoptotic vesicles. We hypothesized that not all dendritic cell populations may both donate MHC antigen to dendritic cells and present antigens acquired from other dendritic cells. All populations tested, including those derived from bone marrow precursor cells stimulated primary, allogeneic T-cell responses and acted as accessory cells for mitogen stimulation. Populations of responder type, splenic dendritic cells promoted allogeneic responses indirectly but those derived from bone marrow cells blocked rather than promoted T-cell proliferation. To identify mechanisms underlying this difference we studied transfer of I-A antigens between cells. Active, two-way transfer of allogeneic I-A occurred between splenic primary antigen presenting cells including CD8alpha+ lymphoid dendritic cells, CD8alpha- myeloid dendritic cells and B220+ cells; all these cell types donated as well as acquired MHC molecules. By contrast, the bone marrow-derived dendritic cells donated I-A antigens but acquired negligible amounts. Thus, dendritic cells derived directly from bone marrow cells may stimulate primary T-cell responses through transferring functional MHC to other dendritic cells but may not be able to acquire and present antigens from other dendritic cells. The evidence suggests that T-cell activation may be blocked by the presence of dendritic cells that have not matured through lymphoid tissues which are unable to acquire and present antigens pre-processed by other dendritic cells.

Liver cell-derived microparticles activate hedgehog signaling and alter gene expression in hepatic endothelial cells.	Gastroenterology	2009	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Angiogenesis contributes to vascular remodeling during cirrhosis. In cirrhotic livers, cholangiocytes, and myofibroblastic hepatic stellate cells (MF-HSC) produce Hedgehog (Hh) ligands. During embryogenesis Hh ligands are released from ligand-producing cells in microparticles and activate Hh signaling in endothelial cells. We studied whether adult liver cell-derived microparticles contain Hh ligands that alter hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC). METHODS: MF-HSC and cholangiocytes were exposed to platelet-derived growth factor to induce Hh ligands; microparticles were isolated from medium, analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and immunoblots, and applied to Hh-reporter-containing cells. Microparticles were obtained from serum and bile of rats after bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham surgery and applied to normal primary liver SEC with or without cyclopamine, an Hh signaling inhibitor. Effects on SEC gene expression were evaluated by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Hh target gene expression and SEC activation markers were compared in primary SEC and in liver sections from healthy and BDL rats. RESULTS: Platelet-derived growth factor-treated MF-HSC and cholangiocytes released exosome-enriched microparticles containing biologically-active Hh ligands. BDL increased release of Hh-containing exosome-enriched microparticles into plasma and bile. Transmission electron microscopy and immunoblots revealed similarities among microparticles from all sources; all microparticles induced similar Hh-dependent changes in SEC gene expression. SEC from healthy livers did not express Hh target genes or activation markers, but both were up-regulated in SEC after BDL. CONCLUSIONS: Hh-containing exosome-enriched microparticles released from liver cells alter hepatic SEC gene expression, suggesting a novel mechanism for cirrhotic vasculopathy.	PMC3724240

Molecular cloning and characterization of ecto-5'-nucleotidase from the venoms of Gloydius blomhoffi.	Toxicon	2009	A Gloydius blomhoffi brevicaudus venom gland cDNA library was screened to isolate cDNA clones using probes based on highly conserved amino acid sequences from known ecto-5'-nucleotidases (ecto-5'-NTs). Molecular cloning of ecto-5'-NT from G. blomhoffi brevicaudus venom predicted that it was a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein containing 588 amino acid residues with 7 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The deduced amino acid sequence shows approximately 60% sequence identity to mammalian ecto-5'-NT sequences. This is the first report of the primary structure of ecto-5'-NT from a reptile. Gel-filtration chromatography of fresh venom from Gloydius blomhoffi blomhoffi, a subspecies of G. blomhoffi, revealed that at least a part of ecto-5'-NT is bound to exosome-like vesicles.

Membrane-associated Hsp72 from tumor-derived exosomes mediates STAT3-dependent immunosuppressive function of mouse and human myeloid-derived suppressor cells.	J Clin Invest	2010	Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been identified in humans and mice as a population of immature myeloid cells with the ability to suppress T cell activation. They accumulate in tumor-bearing mice and humans and have been shown to contribute to cancer development. Here, we have isolated tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) from mouse cell lines and shown that an interaction between TDE-associated Hsp72 and MDSCs determines the suppressive activity of the MDSCs via activation of Stat3. In addition, tumor-derived soluble factors triggered MDSC expansion via activation of Erk. TDE-associated Hsp72 triggered Stat3 activation in MDSCs in a TLR2/MyD88-dependent manner through autocrine production of IL-6. Importantly, decreasing exosome production using dimethyl amiloride enhanced the in vivo antitumor efficacy of the chemotherapeutic drug cyclophosphamide in 3 different mouse tumor models. We also demonstrated that this mechanism is relevant in cancer patients, as TDEs from a human tumor cell line activated human MDSCs and triggered their suppressive function in an Hsp72/TLR2-dependent manner. Further, MDSCs from cancer patients treated with amiloride, a drug used to treat high blood pressure that also inhibits exosome formation, exhibited reduced suppressor functions. Collectively, our findings show in both mice and humans that Hsp72 expressed at the surface of TDEs restrains tumor immune surveillance by promoting MDSC suppressive functions.	PMC2810085

Biliary exosomes influence cholangiocyte regulatory mechanisms and proliferation through interaction with primary cilia.	Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol	2010	Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that are thought to participate in intercellular communication. Recent work from our laboratory suggests that, in normal and cystic liver, exosome-like vesicles accumulate in the lumen of intrahepatic bile ducts, presumably interacting with cholangiocyte cilia. However, direct evidence for exosome-ciliary interaction is limited and the physiological relevance of such interaction remains unknown. Thus, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that biliary exosomes are involved in intercellular communication by interacting with cholangiocyte cilia and inducing intracellular signaling and functional responses. Exosomes were isolated from rat bile by differential ultracentrifugation and characterized by scanning, transmission, and immunoelectron microscopy. The exosome-ciliary interaction and its effects on ERK1/2 signaling, expression of the microRNA, miR-15A, and cholangiocyte proliferation were studied on ciliated and deciliated cultured normal rat cholangiocytes. Our results show that bile contains vesicles identified as exosomes by their size, characteristic "saucer-shaped" morphology, and specific markers, CD63 and Tsg101. When NRCs were exposed to isolated biliary exosomes, the exosomes attached to cilia, inducing a decrease of the phosphorylated-to-total ERK1/2 ratio, an increase of miR-15A expression, and a decrease of cholangiocyte proliferation. All these effects of biliary exosomes were abolished by the pharmacological removal of cholangiocyte cilia. Our findings suggest that bile contains exosomes functioning as signaling nanovesicles and influencing intracellular regulatory mechanisms and cholangiocyte proliferation through interaction with primary cilia.

Mol Ther	2011	Microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes, which are shed from cells as a cell-to-cell communication tool, are possible vehicles for navigating RNA molecules to body tissues. It is considered that intravenous injection of such MVs or exosomes from patients would not cause severe not-self and toxic reactions. Previously, we found that macrophages take up liposome-entrapped RNA molecules, some of which remain undegraded in the cells. Here, we demonstrate that transfected RNA molecules in human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells were shed from THP-1 macrophages as contents in MVs during incubation in serum-free medium, which shedding was shown by biochemical analyses such as quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR, expression of TSG101 (a membrane-associated exosomal protein), and immunoelectron microscopic study. More chemically modified RNA molecules (miR-143BPs) entrapped by MVs (MV-miR-143BPs) were secreted from THP-1 macrophages after miR-143BP transfection compared with the amount after transfection with nonmodified miR-143 transfection. Furthermore, we show that the THP-1 macrophages, which were transfected with the miR-143BP ex vivo, secreted MV-miR-143BPs in xenografted nude mice after intravenous injection, because miR-143 levels were significantly increased in the serum, tumor, and kidney of the host animals. These data suggest that some of the transfected miR-143BPs were secreted from THP-1 macrophages as MV-RNAs both in vitro and in vivo.	PMC3034851

Unidirectional transfer of microRNA-loaded exosomes from T cells to antigen-presenting cells.	Nat Commun	2011	The immune synapse is an exquisitely evolved means of communication between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) during antigen recognition. Recent evidence points to the transfer of RNA via exosomes as a novel mode of intercellular communication. Here we show that exosomes of T, B and dendritic immune cells contain microRNA (miRNA) repertoires that differ from those of their parent cells. We investigate whether miRNAs are exchanged during cognate immune interactions, and demonstrate the existence of antigen-driven unidirectional transfer of miRNAs from the T cell to the APC, mediated by the delivery of CD63+ exosomes on immune synapse formation. Inhibition of exosome production by targeting neutral sphingomyelinase-2 impairs transfer of miRNAs to APCs. Moreover, miRNAs transferred during immune synapsis are able to modulate gene expression in recipient cells. Thus, our results support a mechanism of cellular communication involving antigen-dependent, unidirectional intercellular transfer of miRNAs by exosomes during immune synapsis.	PMC3104548
21855666	D Michiel Pegtel	VU University Medical Center, Department of Pathology, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 	m.pegtel@vumc.nl		Viral miRNAs exploiting the endosomal-exosomal pathway for intercellular cross-talk and immune evasion.	Biochim Biophys Acta	2011 Nov-Dec	The class of persistent gamma-herpesviruses has developed a variety of strategies that exploit host-cell regulatory pathways to ensure a long-lasting, well-balanced infection of their host. However when these pathways are deregulated, an otherwise harmless infection can lead to disease including cancer. We recently demonstrated that the human herpes virus 4 (HHV4) also known as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), encodes for small regulatory non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) that can be transferred from an infected cell to uninfected neighboring cells. Upon arrival these miRNAs are functional in the recipient cell, in that they are able to down regulate specific target genes. These secreted miRNAs are transported to recipient cells via small nano-sized vesicles (known as exosomes) that are of endosomal origin, formed as intraluminal vesicles (ILV) inside multivesicular bodies (MVB). One question that needs to be addressed is how viral miRNAs are sorted into these exosomes. Mature miRNAs, including those of viral origin, are loaded into RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) for gene silencing via blocking mRNA translation and/or initiating mRNA decay. Recent insights indicate that cytoplasmic RNA granules rich in RISC complexes are closely associated with endosomes. In fact, selective components of RISC, including GW182 and Argonaut proteins, miRNAs and mRNAs are present in exosomes. Thus miRNA function, mRNA stability and exosome-mediated intercellular communication converge at the level of endosomes. Since endosomes can be considered as key intracellular cross-roads that regulate communication of cells with their exterior, including neighboring cells, it is perhaps not surprising that viruses have found means to exploit this pathway to their benefit. Little is known however, how and if (micro) RNA species are specifically sorted into ILVs and what (micro)RNA-binding proteins are involved. Here we discuss recent developments relating to intracellular trafficking and function of miRNA-containing protein complexes that EBV may exploit for promoting or restricting miRNAs sorting into exosomes for intercellular regulatory functions.

Blood-borne macrophage-neural cell interactions hitchhike on endosome networks for cell-based nanozyme brain delivery.	Nanomedicine (Lond)	2012	BACKGROUND: Macrophage-carried nanoformulated catalase ('nanozyme') attenuates neuroinflammation and protects nigrostriatal neurons from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine intoxication. This is facilitated by effective enzyme transfer from blood-borne macrophages to adjacent endothelial cells and neurons leading to the decomposition of reactive oxygen species. MATERIALS & METHODS: We examined the intra- and inter-cellular trafficking mechanisms of nanozymes by confocal microscopy. Improved neuronal survival mediated by nanozyme-loaded macrophages was demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. RESULTS: In macrophages, nanozymes were internalized mainly by clathrin-mediated endocytosis then trafficked to recycling endosomes. The enzyme is subsequently released in exosomes facilitated by bridging conduits. Nanozyme transfer from macrophages to adjacent cells by endocytosis-independent mechanisms diffusing broadly throughout the recipient cells. In contrast, macrophage-free nanozymes were localized in lysosomes following endocytic entry. CONCLUSION: Facilitated transfer of nanozyme from cell to cell can improve neuroprotection against oxidative stress commonly seen during neurodegenerative disease processes.	PMC3384770

Front Immunol	2012	In addition to their central role in allergy, mast cells are involved in a wide variety of cellular interactions during homeostasis and disease. In this review, we discuss the ability of mast cells to extend their mechanisms for intercellular communication beyond the release of soluble mediators. These include formation of mast cell synapses on antigen presenting surfaces, as well as cell-cell contacts with dendritic cells and T cells. Release of membrane bound exosomes also provide for the transfer of antigen, mast cell proteins, and RNA to other leukocytes. With the recognition of the extended role mast cells have during immune modulation, further investigation of the processes in which mast cells are involved is necessary. This reopens mast cell research to exciting possibilities, demonstrating it to be an immunological frontier.	PMC3342342

Effects of subtoxic concentrations of TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles on human lymphocytes, dendritic cells and exosome production.	Toxicol Appl Pharmacol	2012	Metal oxide nanoparticles are widely used in the paint and coating industry as well as in cosmetics, but the knowledge of their possible interactions with the immune system is very limited. Our aims were to investigate if commercially available TiO(2) and ZnO nanoparticles may affect different human immune cells and their production of exosomes, nano-sized vesicles that have a role in cell to cell communication. We found that the TiO(2) or ZnO nanoparticles at concentrations from 1 to 100μg/mL did not affect the viability of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In contrast, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) reacted with a dose dependent increase in cell death and caspase activity to ZnO but not to TiO(2) nanoparticles. Non-toxic exposure, 10μg/mL, to TiO(2) and ZnO nanoparticles did not significantly alter the phenotype of MDDC. Interestingly, ZnO but not TiO(2) nanoparticles induced a down regulation of FcγRIII (CD16) expression on NK-cells in the PBMC population, suggesting that subtoxic concentrations of ZnO nanoparticles might have an effect on FcγR-mediated immune responses. The phenotype and size of exosomes produced by PBMC or MDDC exposed to the nanoparticles were similar to that of exosomes harvested from control cultures. TiO(2) or ZnO nanoparticles could not be detected within or associated to exosomes as analyzed with TEM. We conclude that TiO(2) and ZnO nanoparticles differently affect immune cells and that evaluations of nanoparticles should be performed even at subtoxic concentrations on different primary human immune cells when investigating potential effects on immune functions.

Exosomes mediate the cytoprotective action of mesenchymal stromal cells on hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension.	Circulation	2012	BACKGROUND: Hypoxia induces an inflammatory response in the lung manifested by alternative activation of macrophages with elevation of proinflammatory mediators that are critical for the later development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. Mesenchymal stromal cell transplantation inhibits lung inflammation, vascular remodeling, and right heart failure and reverses hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in experimental models of disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the paracrine mechanisms by which mesenchymal stromal cells are protective in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: We fractionated mouse mesenchymal stromal cell-conditioned media to identify the biologically active component affecting in vivo hypoxic signaling and determined that exosomes, secreted membrane microvesicles, suppressed the hypoxic pulmonary influx of macrophages and the induction of proinflammatory and proproliferative mediators, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and hypoxia-inducible mitogenic factor, in the murine model of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. Intravenous delivery of mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes (MEX) inhibited vascular remodeling and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, whereas MEX-depleted media or fibroblast-derived exosomes had no effect. MEX suppressed the hypoxic activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and the upregulation of the miR-17 superfamily of microRNA clusters, whereas it increased lung levels of miR-204, a key microRNA, the expression of which is decreased in human pulmonary hypertension. MEX produced by human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells inhibited STAT3 signaling in isolated human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, demonstrating a direct effect of MEX on hypoxic vascular cells. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that MEX exert a pleiotropic protective effect on the lung and inhibit pulmonary hypertension through suppression of hyperproliferative pathways, including STAT3-mediated signaling induced by hypoxia.

Proinflammatory role of epithelial cell-derived exosomes in allergic airway inflammation.	J Allergy Clin Immunol	2013	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are nanovesicles involved in intercellular communication. Their roles in various diseases are often contextual, depending on the cell type producing them. Although few studies hint toward the proinflammatory role of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid-derived exosomes in asthmatic progression, the cell types in lungs associated with exosome-mediated crosstalk and their resultant effects remain unexplored. OBJECTIVE: It is well established that exosome-mediated cellular communication can influence disease phenotypes. This study explores exosome-mediated cellular crosstalk between structural and immune cells in asthma pathogenesis. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated and detected from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of control and asthmatic mice and were quantified by using a bead-based assay. Involvement of epithelial cells and macrophages were established by using immunohistochemical techniques in lung tissue sections. The role of IL-13 in exosome production was ascertained by using various in vitro and in vivo techniques. Exosome secretion was blocked in in vitro and in vivo settings by using a chemical inhibitor, and the effects on various asthmatic features were studied. RESULTS: Using combinatorial in vitro and in vivo approaches, we found that exosome secretion and production of exosome-associated proteins are higher in lungs of asthmatic mice compared with that seen in sham mice. Asthma is marked by enhanced secretion of exosomes by epithelial cells, but not macrophages, under the influence of IL-13. These epithelial cell exosomes induce proliferation and chemotaxis of undifferentiated macrophages. On the other hand, GW4869, which inhibited exosome production, resulted in a reduced population of proliferating monocytes and alleviation of various asthmatic features. CONCLUSION: Under the influence of IL-13, epithelial cell-derived exosomes can induce enhanced proliferation and chemotaxis of undifferentiated macrophages in the lungs during asthmatic inflammatory conditions.

Mutant copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) induces protein secretion pathway alterations and exosome release in astrocytes: implications for disease spreading and motor neuron pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	J Biol Chem	2013	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most common motor neuron disease and is still incurable. The mechanisms leading to the selective motor neuron vulnerability are still not known. The interplay between motor neurons and astrocytes is crucial in the outcome of the disease. We show that mutant copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) overexpression in primary astrocyte cultures is associated with decreased levels of proteins involved in secretory pathways. This is linked to a general reduction of total secreted proteins, except for specific enrichment in a number of proteins in the media, such as mutant SOD1 and valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97. Because there was also an increase in exosome release, we can deduce that astrocytes expressing mutant SOD1 activate unconventional secretory pathways, possibly as a protective mechanism. This may help limit the formation of intracellular aggregates and overcome mutant SOD1 toxicity. We also found that astrocyte-derived exosomes efficiently transfer mutant SOD1 to spinal neurons and induce selective motor neuron death. We conclude that the expression of mutant SOD1 has a substantial impact on astrocyte protein secretion pathways, contributing to motor neuron pathology and disease spread.	PMC3668729

Exosomes secreted by human cells transport largely mRNA fragments that are enriched in the 3'-untranslated regions.	Biol Direct	2013	Small secreted membrane vesicles called exosomes have recently attracted a great interest after the discovery that they transfer mRNA that can be translated into protein in recipient cells. Surprisingly, we found that for the majority of exosomal mRNAs only a fraction of their corresponding probes is detectable on the expression microarrays. Exosomal mRNA fragmentation is characterized with a specific structural pattern. The closer to the 3'-end of the transcript the fragments are localized, the larger fraction among the secreted RNAs they constitute. Since the 3'-ends of transcripts contain elements conferring subcellular localization of mRNA and are rich in miRNA-binding sites, exosomal RNA may act as competing RNA to regulate stability, localization and translation activity of mRNAs in recipient cells. REVIEWERS: This article was reviewed by Neil Smalheiser and Sandor Pongor.	PMC3732077

Systemic administration of exosomes released from mesenchymal stromal cells promote functional recovery and neurovascular plasticity after stroke in rats.	J Cereb Blood Flow Metab	2013	Here, for the first time, we test a novel hypothesis that systemic treatment of stroke with exosomes derived from multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) promote neurovascular remodeling and functional recovery after stroke in rats. Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) followed by tail vein injection of 100 μg protein from MSC exosome precipitates or an equal volume of vehicle phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (n=6/group) 24 hours later. Animals were killed at 28 days after stroke and histopathology and immunohistochemistry were employed to identify neurite remodeling, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis. Systemic administration of MSC-generated exosomes significantly improved functional recovery in stroke rats compared with PBS-treated controls. Axonal density and synaptophysin-positive areas were significantly increased along the ischemic boundary zone of the cortex and striatum in MCAo rats treated with exosomes compared with PBS control. Exosome treatment significantly increased the number of newly formed doublecortin (a marker of neuroblasts) and von Willebrand factor (a marker of endothelial cells) cells. Our results suggest that intravenous administration of cell-free MSC-generated exosomes post stroke improves functional recovery and enhances neurite remodeling, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis and represents a novel treatment for stroke.

Comparative proteomics evaluation of plasma exosome isolation techniques and assessment of the stability of exosomes in normal human blood plasma.	Proteomics	2013	Exosomes are nanovesicles released by a variety of cells and are detected in body fluids including blood. Recent studies have highlighted the critical application of exosomes as personalized targeted drug delivery vehicles and as reservoirs of disease biomarkers. While these research applications have created significant interest and can be translated into practice, the stability of exosomes needs to be assessed and exosome isolation protocols from blood plasma need to be optimized. To optimize methods to isolate exosomes from blood plasma, we performed a comparative evaluation of three exosome isolation techniques (differential centrifugation coupled with ultracentrifugation, epithelial cell adhesion molecule immunoaffinity pull-down, and OptiPrep(TM) density gradient separation) using normal human plasma. Based on MS, Western blotting and microscopy results, we found that the OptiPrep(TM) density gradient method was superior in isolating pure exosomal populations, devoid of highly abundant plasma proteins. In addition, we assessed the stability of exosomes in plasma over 90 days under various storage conditions. Western blotting analysis using the exosomal marker, TSG101, revealed that exosomes are stable for 90 days. Interestingly, in the context of cellular uptake, the isolated exosomes were able to fuse with target cells revealing that they were indeed biologically active.

More recently we detected that PMCA4a isoform, in addition to its presence in testis, is secreted in the epididymal luminal fluid and transferred to sperm. Here we show that Pmca4 mRNA is expressed in both the 4a and 4b variants in the vagina, uterus, and oviduct. Immunofluorescence reveals that PMCA4a is similarly expressed and is elevated during estrus, appearing in the glandular and luminal epithelia. Western analysis detected PMCA4a in all tissues and in the luminal fluids (LF) of the vagina (VLF), uterus (ULF), and the oviduct (OLF) collected during estrus. It was ~9- and 4-fold higher in OLF than in VLF and ULF, and only marginally present in LF collected at metestrus/diestrus. Fractionation of the LF collected at estrus, via ultracentrifugation, revealed that 100% of the PMCA4a resides in the vesicular fraction of the ULF and OLF. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that OLF vesicles have an exosomal orientation (with the cytoplasmic-side inward), a size range of 25-100 nm, with the characteristic CD9 biomarker. Thus, we dubbed these vesicles "oviductosomes", to which PMCA4a was immunolocalized. Incubation of caudal sperm in the combined LF or exosomes resulted in up to a ~3-fold increase of sperm PMCA4a, as detected by flow cytometry, indicating in vitro uptake. Our results are consistent with the increased requirement of Ca(2+) efflux in the oviduct. They show for the first time the presence of oviductal exosomes and highlight their role, along with uterosomes and vaginal exosomes, in post-testicular sperm acquisition of PMCA4a which is essential for hyperactivated motility and fertility.

Exosomes from breast milk inhibit HIV-1 infection of dendritic cells and subsequent viral transfer to CD4+ T cells.	AIDS	2014	OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether exosomes derived from human breast milk or plasma confer protection against HIV-1 infection of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and subsequent viral transfer to CD4 T cells. DESIGN: MDDCs were generated and milk and plasma-derived exosomes were isolated from healthy donors. To determine the capacity of exosomes to inhibit HIV-1 infection, MDDCs were preincubated with exosomes before exposure to HIV-1BaL. To investigate transfer of HIV-1 from MDDCs to CD4 T cells, MDDCs preincubated with exosomes and HIV-1BaL were cocultured with allogeneic CD4 T cells. To explore receptors used by MDDCs for binding of exosomes, blocking experiments were performed. METHODS: Productive HIV-1 infection was analysed in MDDCs and CD4 T cells by determining p24 expression by flow cytometry. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry was used to investigate uptake of fluorescently labelled exosomes by MDDCs. RESULTS: Milk exosomes, but not plasma exosomes, bind MDDCs via DC-SIGN inhibiting HIV-1 infection of MDDCs and subsequent viral transfer to CD4 T cells. CONCLUSION: We propose that milk exosomes act as a novel protective factor against vertical transmission of HIV-1 by competing with HIV-1 for binding to DC-SIGN on MDDCs.

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2014	Hypoxia occurs within adipose tissues as a result of adipocyte hypertrophy and is associated with adipocyte dysfunction in obesity. Here, we examined whether hypoxia affects the characteristics of adipocyte-derived exosomes. Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted from most cell types as an information carrier between donor and recipient cells, containing a variety of proteins as well as genetic materials. Cultured differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to hypoxic conditions and the protein content of the exosomes produced from these cells was compared by quantitative proteomic analysis. A total of 231 proteins were identified in the adipocyte-derived exosomes. Some of these proteins showed altered expression levels under hypoxic conditions. These results were confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Especially, hypoxic adipocyte-released exosomes were enriched in enzymes related to de novo lipogenesis such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and fatty acid synthase (FASN). The total amount of proteins secreted from exosomes increased by 3-4-fold under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, hypoxia-derived exosomes promoted lipid accumulation in recipient 3T3-L1 adipocytes, compared with those produced under normoxic conditions. FASN levels were increased in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells treated with FASN-containing hypoxic adipocytes-derived exosomes. This is a study to characterize the proteomic profiles of adipocyte-derived exosomes. Exosomal proteins derived from hypoxic adipocytes may affect lipogenic activity in neighboring preadipocytes and adipocytes.

Exosomes from drug-resistant breast cancer cells transmit chemoresistance by a horizontal transfer of microRNAs.	PLoS One	2014	Adriamycin and docetaxel are two agents commonly used in treatment of breast cancer, but their efficacy is often limited by the emergence of chemoresistance. Recent studies indicate that exosomes act as vehicles for exchange of genetic cargo between heterogeneous populations of tumor cells, engendering a transmitted drug resistance for cancer development and progression. However, the specific contribution of breast cancer-derived exosomes is poorly understood. Here we reinforced other's report that human breast cancer cell line MCF-7/S could acquire increased survival potential from its resistant variants MCF-7/Adr and MCF-7/Doc. Additionally, exosomes of the latter, A/exo and D/exo, significantly modulated the cell cycle distribution and drug-induced apoptosis with respect to S/exo. Exosomes pre-treated with RNase were unable to regulate cell cycle and apoptosis resistance, suggesting an RNA-dependent manner. Microarray and polymerase chain reaction for the miRNA expression profiles of A/exo, D/exo, and S/exo demonstrated that they loaded selective miRNA patterns. Following A/exo and D/exo transfer to recipient MCF-7/S, the same miRNAs were significantly increased in acquired cells. Target gene prediction and pathway analysis showed the involvement of miR-100, miR-222, and miR-30a in pathways implicated in cancer pathogenesis, membrane vesiculation and therapy failure. Furthermore, D/exo co-culture assays and miRNA mimics transfection experiments indicated that miR-222-rich D/exo could alter target gene expression in MCF-7/S. Our results suggest that drug-resistant breast cancer cells may spread resistance capacity to sensitive ones by releasing exosomes and that such effects could be partly attributed to the intercellular transfer of specific miRNAs.

Am J Physiol Cell Physiol	2014	Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs in response to a variety of conditions including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cancer, and elevated glucocorticoids. MicroRNAs (miR) may play a role in the wasting process. Activation of the forkhead box O3 (FoxO3) transcription factor causes skeletal muscle atrophy in patients, animals, and cultured cells by increasing the expression of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome proteolytic systems. To identify microRNAs that potentially modulate the atrophy process, an in silico target analysis was performed and miR-182 was predicted to target FoxO3 mRNA. Using a combination of immunoblot analysis, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and FoxO3 3'-UTR luciferase reporter genes, miR-182 was confirmed to regulate FoxO3 expression in C2C12 myotubes. Transfection of miR-182 into muscle cells decreased FoxO3 mRNA 30% and FoxO3 protein 67% (P < 0.05) and also prevented a glucocorticoid-induced upregulation of multiple FoxO3 gene targets including MAFbx/atrogin-1, autophagy-related protein 12 (ATG12), cathepsin L, and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3). Treatment of C2C12 myotubes with dexamethasone (Dex) (1 μM, 6 h) to induce muscle atrophy decreased miR-182 expression by 63% (P < 0.05). Similarly, miR-182 was decreased 44% (P < 0.05) in the gastrocnemius muscle of rats injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes compared with controls. Finally, miR-182 was present in exosomes isolated from the media of C2C12 myotubes and Dex increased its abundance. These data identify miR-182 as an important regulator of FoxO3 expression that participates in the control of atrophy-inducing genes during catabolic diseases.	PMC4137139

Electronic address: .	ketil.pedersen@lifetech.com		Expression of B-cell surface antigens in subpopulations of exosomes released from B-cell lymphoma cells.	Clin Ther	2014	PURPOSE: Exosomes are small (30- to 100-nm) vesicles secreted by all cell types in culture and found in most body fluids. A mean of 1 mL of blood serum, derived from healthy donors, contains approximately 10(12) exosomes. Depending on the disease, the number of exosomes can fluctuate. Concentration of exosomes in the bloodstream and all other body fluids is extremely high. Several B-cell surface antigens (CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD24, CD37, CD40, and HLA-DR) and the common leukocyte antigen CD45 are interesting in terms of immunotherapy of hematologic malignant neoplasms. The established standard for exosome isolation is ultracentrifugation. However, this method cannot discriminate between exosome subpopulations and other nanovesicles. The main purpose of this study was to characterize CD81(+) and CD63(+) subpopulations of exosomes in terms of these surface markers after release from various types of B-cell lymphoma cell lines using an easy and reliable method of immunomagnetic separation. METHODS: Western blotting, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy were used to compare the total preenriched extracellular vesicle (EV) pool to each fraction of vesicles after specific isolation, using magnetic beads conjugated with antibodies raised against the exosome markers CD63 and CD81. FINDINGS: Magnetic bead-based isolation is a convenient method to study and compare subpopulations of exosomes released from B-cell lymphoma cells. The data indicated that the specifically isolated vesicles differed from the total preenriched EV pool. CD19, CD20, CD24, CD37, and HLA-DR, but not CD22, CD23, CD40, and CD45, are expressed on exosomes from B-cell lymphoma cell lines with large heterogeneity among the different B-cell lymphoma cell lines. Interestingly, these B-cell lymphoma-derived EVs are able to rescue lymphoma cells from rituximab-induced complement-dependent cytotoxicity. IMPLICATIONS: Distribution of exosomes that contain CD19, CD20, CD24, CD37, and HLA-DR may intercept immunotherapy directed against these antigens, which is important to be aware of for optimal treatment. The use of an immunomagnetic separation platform enables easy isolation and characterization of exosome subpopulations for further studies of the exosome biology to understand the potential for therapeutic and diagnostic use.

Tumor-Derived Exosomes Contain microRNAs with Immunological Function: Implications for a Novel Immunosuppression Mechanism.	Microrna	2014	Tumor-derived vesicles (TDV) have been recently implicated in immunosuppression by transporting specific proteins, including Fas ligand (FasL) and TRAIL, to immune cells. We hypothesized that TDVs carrying miRNAs with immunological function could interfere with the translational machinery of immune cells and lead to TDV-mediated immunosuppression in cancer. We show that TDVs from human tumor cells indeed contain multiple miRNA species with known roles in lymphocyte development and function: hsa-miR-146a, miR-29a, and miR-21. Quantification by RT-PCR shows that the amount of miR-21 within TDVs isolated from the breast cancer cell line HCC1806 is at physiologically relevant levels. Additionally, we show that these miRNAs carried by TDVs copurify with argonaute proteins. This observation corroborates the idea that the machinery of microvesicle secretion and that of RNA interference are interconnected.

Circulation	2014	BACKGROUND: Despite the promise shown by stem cells for restoration of cardiac function after myocardial infarction, the poor survival of transplanted cells has been a major issue. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1) is a transcription factor that mediates adaptive responses to ischemia. Here, we hypothesize that codelivery of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) with a nonviral minicircle plasmid carrying HIF1 (MC-HIF1) into the ischemic myocardium can improve the survival of transplanted CPCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: After myocardial infarction, CPCs were codelivered intramyocardially into adult NOD/SCID mice with saline, MC-green fluorescent protein, or MC-HIF1 versus MC-HIF1 alone (n=10 per group). Bioluminescence imaging demonstrated better survival when CPCs were codelivered with MC-HIF1. Importantly, echocardiography showed mice injected with CPCs+MC-HIF1 had the highest ejection fraction 6 weeks after myocardial infarction (57.1±2.6%; P=0.002) followed by MC-HIF1 alone (48.5±2.6%; P=0.04), with no significant protection for CPCs+MC-green fluorescent protein (44.8±3.3%; P=NS) when compared with saline control (38.7±3.2%). In vitro mechanistic studies confirmed that cardiac endothelial cells produced exosomes that were actively internalized by recipient CPCs. Exosomes purified from endothelial cells overexpressing HIF1 had higher contents of miR-126 and miR-210. These microRNAs activated prosurvival kinases and induced a glycolytic switch in recipient CPCs, giving them increased tolerance when subjected to in vitro hypoxic stress. Inhibiting both of these miRs blocked the protective effects of the exosomes. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, HIF1 can be used to modulate the host microenvironment for improving survival of transplanted cells. The exosomal transfer of miRs from host cells to transplanted cells represents a unique mechanism that can be potentially targeted for improving survival of transplanted cells.	PMC4862832

Antigen transfer from exosomes to dendritic cells as an explanation for the immune enhancement seen by IgE immune complexes.	PLoS One	2014	IgE antigen complexes induce increased specific T cell proliferation and increased specific IgG production. Immediately after immunization, CD23(+) B cells capture IgE antigen complexes, transport them to the spleen where, via unknown mechanisms, dendritic cells capture the antigen and present it to T cells. CD23, the low affinity IgE receptor, binds IgE antigen complexes and internalizes them. In this study, we show that these complexes are processed onto B-cell derived exosomes (bexosomes) in a CD23 dependent manner. The bexosomes carry CD23, IgE and MHC II and stimulate antigen specific T-cell proliferation in vitro. When IgE antigen complex stimulated bexosomes are incubated with dendritic cells, dendritic cells induce specific T-cell proliferation in vivo, similar to IgE antigen complexes. This suggests that bexosomes can provide the essential transfer mechanism for IgE antigen complexes from B cells to dendritic cells.	PMC4203810

J Allergy Clin Immunol	2015	BACKGROUND: Eosinophils secrete several granules that are involved in the propagation of inflammatory responses in patients with pathologies such as asthma. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that some of these granules are exosomes, which, when transferred to the recipient cells, could modulate asthma progression. METHODS: Eosinophils were purified from peripheral blood and cultured with or without IFN-γ or eotaxin. Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in eosinophils were studied by using fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and flow cytometry. Exosome secretion was measured and exosome characterization was performed with TEM, Western blotting, and NanoSight analysis. RESULTS: Generation of MVBs in eosinophils was confirmed by using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry and corroborated by means of TEM. Having established that eosinophils contain MVBs, our aim was to demonstrate that eosinophils secrete exosomes. To do this, we purified exosomes from culture medium of eosinophils and characterized them. Using Western blot analysis, we demonstrated that eosinophils secreted exosomes and that the discharge of exosomes to extracellular media increases after IFN-γ stimulation. We measured exosome size and quantified exosome production from healthy and asthmatic subjects using nanotracking analysis. We found that exosome production was augmented in asthmatic patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings are the first to demonstrate that eosinophils contain functional MVBs and secrete exosomes and that their secretion is increased in asthmatic patients. Thus exosomes might play an important role in the progression of asthma and eventually be considered a biomarker.

Size and shape characterization of hydrated and desiccated exosomes.	Anal Bioanal Chem	2015	Exosomes are stable nanovesicles secreted by cells into the circulation. Their reported sizes differ substantially, which likely reflects the difference in the isolation techniques used, the cells that secreted them, and the methods used in their characterization. We analyzed the influence of the last factor on the measured sizes and shapes of hydrated and desiccated exosomes isolated from the serum of a pancreatic cancer patient and a healthy control. We found that hydrated exosomes are close-to-spherical nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic radius that is substantially larger than the geometric size. For desiccated exosomes, we found that the desiccated shape and sizing are influenced by the manner in which drying occurred. Isotropic desiccation in aerosol preserves the near-spherical shape of the exosomes, whereas drying on a surface likely distorts their shapes and influences the sizing results obtained by techniques that require surface fixation prior to analysis.

Proteome characterization of melanoma exosomes reveals a specific signature for metastatic cell lines.	Pigment Cell Melanoma Res	2015	Exosomes are important mediators in cell-to-cell communication and, recently, their role in melanoma progression has been brought to light. Here, we characterized exosomes secreted by seven melanoma cell lines with varying degrees of aggressivity. Extensive proteomic analysis of their exosomes confirmed the presence of characteristic exosomal markers as well as melanoma-specific antigens and oncogenic proteins. Importantly, the protein composition differed among exosomes from different lines. Exosomes from aggressive cells contained specific proteins involved in cell motility, angiogenesis, and immune response, while these proteins were less abundant or absent in exosomes from less aggressive cells. Interestingly, when exposed to exosomes from metastatic lines, less aggressive cells increased their migratory capacities, likely due to transfer of pro-migratory exosomal proteins to recipient cells. Hence, this study shows that the specific protein composition of melanoma exosomes depends on the cells' aggressivity and suggests that exosomes influence the behavior of other tumor cells and their microenvironment.

Heat shock protein 60 levels in tissue and circulating exosomes in human large bowel cancer before and after ablative surgery.	Cancer	2015	BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) is a chaperonin involved in tumorigenesis, but its participation in tumor development and progression is not well understood and its value as a tumor biomarker has not been fully elucidated. In the current study, the authors presented evidence supporting the theory that Hsp60 has potential as a biomarker as well as a therapeutic target in patients with large bowel cancer. METHODS: The authors studied a population of 97 subjects, including patients and controls. Immunomorphology, Western blot analysis, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed on tissue specimens. Exosomes were isolated from blood and characterized by electron microscopy, biochemical tests, and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Hsp60 was found to be increased in cancerous tissue, in which it was localized in the tumor cell plasma membrane, and in the interstitium associated with cells of the immune system, in which it was associated with exosomes liberated by tumor cells and, as such, circulated in the blood. An interesting finding was that these parameters returned to normal shortly after tumor removal. CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study suggested that Hsp60 is a good candidate for theranostics applied to patients with large bowel carcinoma and encourage similar research among patients with other tumors in which Hsp60 has been implicated.

Tumour Biol	2015	Many cell types release extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, microvesicles (MVs), and apoptotic bodies, which play a role in physiology and diseases. Presence and phenotype of circulating EVs in hematological malignancies (HMs) remain largely unexplored.The aim of this study was to characterize EVs in peripheral blood of HM patients compared to healthy subjects (controls). We isolated serum EVs from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and controls. EVs were isolated from serum of peripheral blood by ultracentrifuge steps and analyzed by flow cytometry to define count, size, and immunophenotype. MV levels were significantly elevated in WM, HL, MM, AML, and some MPNs and, though at a lesser degree, in CLL and NHL as compared to healthy controls. HL, MM, and MPNs generated a population of MVs characterized by lower size (below 0.3 μm) when compared to controls. MVs from patients specifically expressed tumor-related antigens, such as CD19 in B cell neoplasms, CD38 in MM, CD13 in myeloid tumors, and CD30 in HL. Both total and antigen-specific count of MVs significantly correlated with different HM clinical features such as Rai stage in CLL, International Prognostic Scoring System in WM, International Staging System in MM, and clinical stage in HL. MVs may represent a novel biomarker in HMs.

A novel pathway of cellular activation mediated by antiphospholipid antibody-induced extracellular vesicles.	J Thromb Haemost	2015	BACKGROUND: Elevated levels of endothelial cell (EC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) circulate in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs), and APLAs, particularly those against β2 -glycoprotein I (β2 GPI), stimulate EV release from ECs. However, the effects of EC-derived EVs have not been characterized. OBJECTIVE: To determine the mechanism by which EVs released from ECs by anti-β2 GPI antibodies activate unstimulated ECs. PATIENTS/METHODS: We used interleukin (IL)-1 receptor inhibitors, small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and microRNA (miRNA) profiling to assess the mechanism(s) by which EVs released from ECs exposed to anti-β2 GPI antibodies activated unstimulated ECs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Anti-β2 GPI antibodies caused formation of an EC inflammasome and the release of EVs that were enriched in mature IL-1β, had a distinct miRNA profile, and caused endothelial activation. However, activation was not inhibited by an IL-1β antibody, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, or IL-1 receptor siRNA. EC activation by EVs required IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 phosphorylation, and was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with TLR7 siRNA or RNase A, which degrades ssRNA. Profiling of miRNA in EVs released from ECs incubated with β2 GPI and either control IgG or anti-β2 GPI antibodies revealed numerous differences in the content of specific miRNAs, including a significant decrease in mIR126. These observations demonstrate that, although anti-β2 GPI-derived endothelial EVs contain IL-1β, they activate unstimulated ECs through a TLR7-dependent and ssRNA-dependent pathway. Alterations in miRNA content may contribute to the ability of EVs derived from ECs exposed to anti-β2 GPI antibodies to activate unstimulated ECs in an autocrine or paracrine manner.	PMC4877623

Oncotarget	2015	Exosomes (EVs) have relevance in cell-to-cell communication carrying pro-tumorigenic factors that participate in oncogenesis and drug resistance and are proposed to have potential as self-delivery systems. Advancing on our studies of EVs in triple-negative breast cancer, here we more comprehensively analysed isogenic cell line variants and their EV populations, tissues cell line variants and their EV populations, as well as breast tumour and normal tissues. Profiling 384 miRNAs showed EV miRNA content to be highly representative of their cells of origin. miRNAs most substantially down-regulated in aggressive cells and their EVs originated from 14q32. Analysis of miR-134, the most substantially down-regulated miRNA, supported its clinical relevance in breast tumours compared to matched normal breast tissue. Functional studies indicated that miR-134 controls STAT5B which, in turn, controls Hsp90. miR-134 delivered by direct transfection into Hs578Ts(i)8 cells (in which it was greatly down-regulated) reduced STAT5B, Hsp90, and Bcl-2 levels, reduced cellular proliferation, and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Delivery via miR-134-enriched EVs also reduced STAT5B and Hsp90, reduced cellular migration and invasion, and enhanced sensitivity to anti-Hsp90 drugs. While the differing effects achieved by transfection or EV delivery are likely to be, at least partly, due to specific amounts of miR-134 delivered by these routes, these EV-based studies identified miRNA-134 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic for breast cancer.

Exosomes enriched in stemness/metastatic-related mRNAS promote oncogenic potential in breast cancer.	Oncotarget	2015	Cancer cells efficiently transfer exosome contents (essentially mRNAs and microRNAs) to other cell types, modifying immune responses, cell growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. Here we analyzed the exosomes release by breast tumor cells with different capacities of stemness/metastasis based on CXCR4 expression, and evaluated their capacity to generate oncogenic features in recipient cells. Breast cancer cells overexpressing CXCR4 showed an increase in stemness-related markers, and in proliferation, migration and invasion capacities. Furthermore, recipient cells treated with exosomes from CXCR4-cells showed increased in the same abilities. Moreover, inoculation of CXCR4-cell-derived exosomes in immunocompromised mice stimulated primary tumor growth and metastatic potential. Comparison of nucleic acids contained into exosomes isolated from patients revealed a "stemness and metastatic" signature in exosomes of patients with worse prognosis. Finally, our data supported the view that cancer cells with stem-like properties show concomitant metastatic behavior, and their exosomes stimulate tumor progression and metastasis. Exosomes-derived nucleic acids from plasma of breast cancer patients are suitable markers in the prognosis of such patients.	PMC4747353
26639242	L Minar				Supernatant versus exosomal urinary microRNAs. Two fractions with different outcomes in gynaecological cancers.	Neoplasma	2016	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulatory molecules implicated in fundamental cell processes. Recent investigations have been focused to investigate their diagnostic potential also in various body fluids. Plasma and serum are widely used for these purposes. Urinary miRNAs, as the easily available type of sample, have been explored particularly in urological diseases recently. However, we have shown previously that differential expression of urinary cell-free miRNAs may be observed also in gynaecological cancers, such as ovarian and endometrial cancers. In the present article, we focus on the differences in particular urine cell-free miRNA abundance among different samples including particularly ovarian and endometrial cancers and rare gynaecological diagnoses involved in the study. Using raw abundance miRNA expression data, we confirmed significant up-regulation of miR-92a in ovarian cancer, and significant down-regulation of miR-106b in endometrial cancers. As miR-21 appeared up-regulated in the endometrial cancer similarly as in the verification process, where also miR-106b resulted in significant down-regulation in ovarian cancer, these miRNAs may be good candidates for further evaluation as novel diagnostics. To find out why supernatant but not exosomal urine miRNAs fraction resulted in significant results in regards to de-regulation of expression, we performed a comparison of the same urine samples isolated by these two manners. We show that diagnostic potential of cell-free urinary miRNAs may depend on the urine fraction used for the isolation. While particular urinary miRNAs may be enriched, other may reveal unchanged or diminished expression in the exosomal fraction in comparison with supernatant fraction, giving differences also between cancer and control samples. More research will be needed to further explore which kind of cell-free samples would give better results for diagnostic purposes in various diagnoses using urinary samples and investigating cell-free miRNAs expression. Meanwhile, different urine fractions should be explored for their miRNA expression to establish novel diagnostic urinary miRNA markers.

J Mol Cell Cardiol	2016	CD4(+) T cell activation plays a key role in facilitating wound healing after myocardial infarction (MI). Exosomes (EXs) secreted from dendritic cells (DCs) can activate T cells in tumor models; however, whether DEXs (DC-EXs) can mediate CD4(+) T cell activation and improve wound healing post-MI remains unknown. This study sought to determine whether DEXs mediate CD4(+) T cell activation and improve cardiac function post-MI in mice. We used supernatants of hypoxic primary or necrotic HL-1 cardiomyocytes to simulate the post-MI cardiomyocyte microenvironment in vitro. Cultured bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) from mice were stimulated with the supernatants of normal (Control group), hypoxic primary or necrotic HL-1 cardiomyocytes (MI group); a subset of BMDCs remained unstimulated (Negative group). DEXs were then isolated from the BMDC supernatants and either incubated with CD4(+) T cells or injected into mice via the tail vein. In this study, we found that the supernatants of both hypoxic primary and necrotic HL-1 cardiomyocytes upregulate DC maturation markers. After the injection of DEXs, a greater number of MI-DEXs are recruited by the mouse spleen and with greater rapidity than control- or negative-DEXs. Confocal imaging and flow cytometry revealed that MI-DEXs exhibited higher uptake by splenic CD4(+) T cells than the control- and negative-DEXs, and this increase was correlated with significantly greater increases in the expression of chemokines and the inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF by the CD4(+) T cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the injection of MI-DEXs improved cardiac function in mice post-MI. These results suggest that DEXs could mediate the activation of CD4(+) T cells through an endocrine mechanism and improve cardiac function post-MI. Our findings provide the basis for a novel strategy for the treatment of MI through the systemic delivery of DEXs.

Hum Reprod	2016	STUDY QUESTION: What proteins are carried by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from normal first trimester placentae? SUMMARY ANSWER: One thousand five hundred and eighty-five, 1656 and 1476 proteins were characterized in macro-, micro- and nano-vesicles, respectively, from first trimester placentae, with all EV fractions being enriched for proteins involved in vesicle transport and inflammation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Placental EVs are being increasingly recognized as important mediators of both healthy and pathological pregnancies. However, current research has focused on detecting changes in specific proteins in particular fractions of vesicles during disease. This is the first study to investigate the full proteome of different-sized fractions of EVs from the same first trimester placenta and highlights the differences/similarities between the vesicle fractions. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A well-established ex vivo placental explant culture model was used to generate macro-, micro- and nano-vesicles from 56 first trimester placentae. Vesicle fractions were collected by differential ultracentrifugation, quantified and characterized. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Placental macro-, micro- and nano-vesicles were characterized by microscopy, dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis. The proteome of each EV fraction was interrogated using liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry. Results were validated by semi-quantitative western blotting. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 1585, 1656 and 1476 proteins were identified in macro-, micro- and nano-vesicles, respectively. One thousand one hundred and twenty-five proteins were shared between all three fractions while up to 223 proteins were unique to each fraction. Gene Ontology pathway analysis showed an enrichment of proteins involved in vesicle transport and inflammation in all three fractions of EVs. The expression levels of proteins involved in internalization of vesicles (annexin V, calreticulin, CD31, CD47), the complement pathway [C3, decay-accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), protectin] and minor histocompatibility antigens [ATP-dependent RNA helicase (DDX3), ribosomal protein S4 (RPS4)] were different between different-sized EVs. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study is largely hypothesis-generating in nature. It is important to validate these findings using EVs isolated from maternal plasma and the function of the different EV fractions would need further investigation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results support the concept that various EV factions can interact with different maternal cells and have unique effects to mediate feto-maternal communication during early pregnancy. This study also provides a list of candidate proteins, which may inform the identification of robust markers that can be used to isolate placental vesicles from the maternal blood in the future.

J Transl Med	2016	BACKGROUND: Growing evidence is showing that metastatic cell populations are able to transfer their characteristics to less malignant cells. Exosomes (EXOs) are membrane vesicles of endocytic origin able to convey their cargo of mRNAs, microRNAs (miRs), proteins and lipids from donors to proximal as well as distant acceptor cells. Our previous results indicated that miR-221&222 are key factors for melanoma development and dissemination. The aim of this study was to verify whether the tumorigenic properties associated with miR-222 overexpression can be also propagated by miR-222-containing EXOs. METHODS: EXOs were isolated by UltraCentrifugation or Exoquick-TC(®) methods. Preparations of melanoma-derived vesicles were characterized by using the Nanosight™ technology and the expression of exosome markers analyzed by western blot. The expression levels of endogenous and exosomal miRNAs were examined by real time PCR. Confocal microscopy was used to evaluate transfer and uptake of microvesicles from donor to recipient cells. The functional significance of exosomal miR-222 was estimated by analyzing the vessel-like process formation, as well as cell cycle rates, invasive and chemotactic capabilities. RESULTS: Besides microvesicle marker characterization, we evidenced that miR-222 exosomal expression mostly reflected its abundance in the cells of origin, correctly paralleled by repression of its target genes, such as p27Kip1, and induction of the PI3K/AKT pathway, thus confirming its functional implication in cancer. The possible differential significance of PI3K/AKT blockade was assessed by using the BKM120 inhibitor in miR-222-transduced cell lines. In addition, in vitro cultures showed that vesicles released by miR-222-overexpressing cells were able to transfer miR-222-dependent malignancy when taken-up by recipient primary melanomas. Results were confirmed by antagomiR-221&222 treatments and by functional observations after internalization of EXOs devoid of these miRs. CONCLUSION: All together these data, besides generally confirming the role of miR-222 in melanoma tumorigenesis, supported its responsibility in the exosome-associated melanoma properties, thus further indicating this miR as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and its abrogation as a future therapeutic option.

J Pediatr Surg	2016	PURPOSE: Treatment options for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remain inadequate. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) can protect the intestines from NEC. Exosomes are nanoparticle-sized vesicles with important cell signaling capabilities. The objective of this study was to determine whether BM-MSC-derived exosomes can prevent NEC. METHODS: Rat pups were either breast fed (Group 1) or subjected to experimental NEC and randomized to receive either no treatment (Group 2) or an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of PBS (Group 3), BM-MSC (Group 4), or BM-MSC-derived exosomes (Group 5). Histologic injury grade and intestinal permeability were determined. The effect of BM-MSC-derived exosomes on IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells in an in vitro scrape model of wound healing was also determined. RESULTS: Animals exposed to NEC that were either untreated or received PBS alone had an NEC incidence of 46% and 41%, respectively (p=0.61). Compared to untreated pups, the incidence of NEC was significantly lower in pups treated with either BM-MSC (9%, p=0.0003) or MB-MSC-derived exosomes (13%, p=0.0008). Similar results were found for intestinal permeability. Wound healing in IEC-6 cells was significantly increased by BM-MSC-derived exosomes. CONCLUSION: BM-MSC-derived exosomes protect the intestines from NEC and may represent a novel, cell-free, preventative therapy for NEC in the future.	PMC4921266

Immunol Res	2016	The mechanisms underlying immunomodulatory ability of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) remain unknown. Recently, studies suggested that the immunomodulatory activity of MSCs is largely mediated by paracrine factors. Among which, exosome is considered to play a major role in the communication between MSCs and target tissue. The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of MSCs-derived exosome on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), especially T cells. We find that the MSCs-derived exosome extracted from healthy donors' bone marrow suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammatory factor TNF-α and IL-1β, but increased the concentration of anti-inflammatory factor TGF-β during in vitro culture. In addition, exosome may induce conversion of T helper type 1 (Th1) into T helper type 2 (Th2) cells and reduced potential of T cells to differentiate into interleukin 17-producing effector T cells (Th17). Moreover, the level of regulatory T cells (Treg) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 were also increased. These results suggested that MSC-derived exosome possesses the immunomodulatory properties. However, it showed no effects on the proliferation of PBMCs or CD3+ T cells, but increases the apoptosis of them. In addition, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) was previously shown to mediate the immunoregulation of MSCs, which was increased in PBMCs co-cultured with MSCs. In our study, IDO showed no significant changes in PBMCs exposed to MSCs-derived exosome. We conclude that exosome and MSCs might differ in their immune-modulating activities and mechanisms.

Multimodal transfer of MDR by exosomes in human osteosarcoma.	Int J Oncol	2016	Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released by both normal and tumour cells which are involved in a new intercellular communication pathway by delivering cargo (e.g., proteins, microRNAs, mRNAs) to recipient cells. Tumour-derived exosomes have been shown to play critical roles in different stages of tumour growth and progression. In this study, we investigated the potential role of exosomes to transfer the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in human osteosarcoma cells. Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation of culture media from multidrug resistant human osteosarcoma MG-63DXR30 (Exo/DXR) and MG-63 parental cells (Exo/S). Exosome purity was examined by transmission electron microscopy and confirmed by immunoblot analysis for the expression of specific exosomal markers. Our data showed that exosomes derived from doxorubicin-resistant osteosarcoma cells could be taken up into secondary cells and induce a doxorubicin-resistant phenotype. The incubation of osteosarcoma cells with Exo/DXR decreased the sensitivity of parental cells to doxorubicin, while exposure with Exo/S was ineffective. In addition, we demonstrated that Exo/DXR expressed higher levels of MDR-1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein compared to Exo/S (p=0.03). Interestingly, both MDR-1 mRNA and P-gp increased in MG-63 cells after incubation with Exo/DXR, suggesting this as the main mechanism of exosome-mediated transfer of drug resistance. Our findings suggest that multidrug resistant osteosarcoma cells are able to spread their ability to resist the effects of doxorubicin treatment on sensitive cells by transferring exosomes carrying MDR-1 mRNA and its product P-glycoprotein.

Am J Transplant	2017	The immunological role of exosomes in allograft rejection remains unknown. We sought to determine whether exosomes are induced during lung allograft rejection and to define the antigenic compositions of HLA, lung-associated self-antigens (SAgs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Exosomes were isolated from sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 30 lung transplant recipients (LTxRs) who were stable or who had acute rejection (AR) or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Exosomes were defined by flow cytometry for CD63 and western blotting for annexin V SAgs, collagen V (Col-V) and Kα1 tubulin were examined by electron microscopy; miRNAs were profiled by a miRNA array. Donor HLA and SAgs were detected on exosomes from LTxRs with AR and BOS but not from stable LTxRs. Exosomes expressing Col-V were isolated from sera from LTxRs 3 mo before AR and 6 mo before BOS diagnosis, suggesting that exosomes with SAgs may be a noninvasive rejection biomarker. Exosomes isolated from LTxRs with AR or BOS also contained immunoregulatory miRNAs. We concluded that exosomes expressing donor HLA, SAgs and immunoregulatory miRNAs are present in the circulation and local site after human lung transplantation and play an important role in the immune pathogenesis of acute allograft rejection and BOS.

J Dairy Sci	2016	Cell-to-cell communication in physiological and pathological conditions may be influenced by neighboring cells, distant tissues, or local environmental factors. Exosomes are specific subsets of extracellular vesicles that internalize and deliver their content to near and distant sites. Exosomes may play a role in the maternal-embryo crosstalk vital for the recognition and maintenance of a pregnancy; however, their role in dairy cow reproduction has not been established. This study aimed to characterize the exosome profile in the plasma of 2 strains of dairy cow with divergent fertility phenotypes. Plasma was obtained and characterized on the basis of genetic ancestry as fertile (FERT; <23% North American genetics, New Zealand Holstein-Friesian strain, n=8) or subfertile (SUBFERT; >92% North American genetics, North American Holstein-Friesian strain, n=8). Exosomes were isolated by differential and buoyant density centrifugation and characterized by size distribution (nanoparticle tracking analysis, NanoSight NS500, NanoSight Ltd., Amesbury, UK), the presence of CD63 (Western blot), and their morphology (electron microscopy). The total number of exosomes was determined by quantifying the immunoreactive CD63 (ExoELISA kit, System Biosciences), and the protein content established by mass spectrometry. Enriched exosome fractions were identified as cup-shape vesicles with diameters around 100 nm and positive for the CD63 marker. The concentration of exosomes was 50% greater in FERT cows. Mass spectrometry identified 104 and 117 proteins in FERT and SUBFERT cows, of which 23 and 36 were unique, respectively. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment for proteins involved in immunomodulatory processes and cell-to-cell communication. Although the role of exosomes in dairy cow reproduction remains to be elucidated, their quantification and content in models with divergent fertility phenotypes could provide novel information to support both physiological and genetic approaches to improving dairy cow fertility.

J Pathol	2016	A frequent complication of acute pancreatitis is the lung damage associated with the systemic inflammatory response. Although various pro-inflammatory mediators generated at both local and systemic levels have been identified, the pathogenic mechanisms of the disease are still poorly understood. In recent years, exosomes have emerged as a new intercellular communication system able to transfer encapsulated proteins and small RNAs and protect them from degradation. Using an experimental model of taurocholate-induced acute pancreatitis in rats, we aimed to evaluate the role of exosomes in the extent of the systemic inflammatory response. Induction of pancreatitis increased the concentration of circulating exosomes, which showed a different proteomic profile to those obtained from control animals. A series of tracking experiments using PKH26-stained exosomes revealed that circulating exosomes effectively reached the alveolar compartment and were internalized by macrophages. In vitro experiments revealed that exosomes obtained under inflammatory conditions activate and polarize these alveolar macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Interestingly, the proteomic analysis of circulating exosomes during acute pancreatitis suggested a multi-organ origin with a relevant role for the liver as a source of these vesicles. Tracking experiments also revealed that the liver retains the majority of exosomes from the peritoneal cavity. We conclude that exosomes are involved in the lung damage associated with experimental acute pancreatitis and could be relevant mediators in the systemic effects of pancreatitis.

J Neurosci	2016	Recent evidence implicates exosomes in the aggregation of Aβ and spreading of tau in Alzheimer's disease. In neural cells, exosome formation can be blocked by inhibition or silencing of neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2). We generated genetically nSMase2-deficient 5XFAD mice (fro;5XFAD) to assess AD-related pathology in a mouse model with consistently reduced ceramide generation. We conducted in vitro assays to assess Aβ42 aggregation and glial clearance with and without exosomes isolated by ultracentrifugation and determined exosome-induced amyloid aggregation by particle counting. We analyzed brain exosome content, amyloid plaque formation, neuronal degeneration, sphingolipid, Aβ42 and phospho-tau levels, and memory-related behaviors in 5XFAD versus fro;5XFAD mice using contextual and cued fear conditioning. Astrocyte-derived exosomes accelerated aggregation of Aβ42 and blocked glial clearance of Aβ42 in vitro Aβ42 aggregates were colocalized with extracellular ceramide in vitro using a bifunctional ceramide analog preloaded into exosomes and in vivo using anticeramide IgG, implicating ceramide-enriched exosomes in plaque formation. Compared with 5XFAD mice, the fro;5XFAD mice had reduced brain exosomes, ceramide levels, serum anticeramide IgG, glial activation, total Aβ42 and plaque burden, tau phosphorylation, and improved cognition in a fear-conditioned learning task. Ceramide-enriched exosomes appear to exacerbate AD-related brain pathology by promoting the aggregation of Aβ. Reduction of exosome secretion by nSMase2 loss of function improves pathology and cognition in the 5XFAD mouse model. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We present for the first time evidence, using Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice deficient in neural exosome secretion due to lack of neutral sphingomyelinase-2 function, that ceramide-enriched exosomes exacerbate AD-related pathologies and cognitive deficits. Our results provide rationale to pursue a means of inhibiting exosome secretion as a potential therapy for individuals at risk for developing AD.	PMC4987436

J Neuroinflammation	2016	BACKGROUND: Synaptodendritic damage is a pathological hallmark of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, and HIV-1 Tat protein is known to cause such injury in the central nervous system. In this study, we aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms of Tat-induced neurite shortening, specifically the roles of miR-132, an important regulator of neurite morphogenesis in this process. METHODS: The relationship between Tat expression and miR-132 expression was first determined using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in Tat-transfected astrocytes and neurons, astrocytes from Tat-transgenic mice, and HIV-infected astrocytes. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to determine Tat effects on expression of miR-132 target genes methyl CpG-binding protein 2, Rho GTPase activator p250GAP, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Exosomes were isolated from Tat-expressing astrocytes, and exosomal microRNA (miRNA) uptake into neurons was studied using miRNA labeling and flow cytometry. The lactate dehydrogenase release was used to determine the cytotoxicity, while immunostaining was used to determine neurite lengths and synapse formation. Tat basic domain deletion mutant and miR-132 mimic and inhibitor were used to determine the specificity of the relationship between Tat and miR-132 and its effects on astrocytes and neurons and the underlying mechanisms of Tat-induced miR-132 expression. RESULTS: Tat significantly induced miR-132 expression, ensuing down-regulation of miR-132 target genes in astrocytes and neurons. miR-132 induction was associated with phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein and required the basic domain of Tat. miRNA-132 induction had no effects on astrocyte activation or survival but was involved in the direct neurotoxicity of Tat. miR-132 was present in astrocyte-derived exosomes and was taken up by neurons, causing neurite shortening. CONCLUSIONS: Tat-induced miR-132 expression contributes to both direct and astrocyte-mediated Tat neurotoxicity and supports the important roles of miR-132 in controlling neurite outgrowth.

Kidney Int	2017	Vascular progenitor cells show promise for the treatment of microvasculature endothelial injury. We investigated the function of renal artery progenitor cells derived from radical nephrectomy patients, in animal models of acute ischemic and hyperperfusion injuries. Present in human adventitia, CD34positive/CD105negative cells were clonal and expressed transcription factors Sox2/Oct4 as well as surface markers CXCR4 (CD184)/KDR(CD309) consistent with endothelial progenitor cells. Termed renal artery-derived vascular progenitor cells (RAPC), injected cells were associated with decreased serum creatinine after ischemia/reperfusion, reduced albuminuria after hyperperfusion, and improved blood flow in both models. A small population of RAPC integrated with the renal microvasculature following either experimental injury. At a cellular level, RAPC promoted local endothelial migration in co-culture. Profiling of RAPC microRNA identified high levels of miRNA 218; also found at high levels in exosomes isolated from RAPC conditioned media after cell contact for 24 hours. After hydrogen peroxide-induced endothelial injury, RAPC exosomes harbored Robo-1 transcript; a gene known to be regulated by mir218. Such exosomes enhanced endothelial cell migration in culture in the absence of RAPC. Thus, our work shows the feasibility of pre-emptive pro-angiogenic progenitor cell procurement from a targeted patient population and potential therapeutic use in the form of autologous cell transplantation.

Clin Transl Oncol	2017	OBJECTIVE: We evaluated miR-451 expression in serum and tissue samples of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients. Then, we examined a secretory role of miR-451 in esophageal tumor microenvironment. METHODS: miR-451 expression was evaluated in 39 serum samples from esophageal SCC patients compared to 39 normal individuals as well as 26 pairs of fresh-frozen tumor and adjacent normal tissues from patients with ESCC, using qRT-PCR. In a co-culture system of human normal fibroblasts (HFSF-PI3) and esophageal cancer cell line (KYSE-30), we evaluated exosomal miR-451 secretion into the conditioned medium (CM) of both cell lines. Then, we analyzed the effect of primiR-451-transfected fibroblasts on the migration potency of their neighboring KYSE-30 cells. RESULTS: We detected miR-451 over-expression in serum samples of esophageal cancer patients compared to the normal group (P = 0.005). Interestingly, fresh-frozen tumor tissues from the same patients showed miR-451 down-regulation compared to their adjacent normal counterparts (P = 0.043). Co-culturing the KYSE-30 cell line with normal fibroblasts significantly induced miR-451 exosomal secretion into the CM. Moreover, co-culture of KYSE-30 cell line with miR-451-over-expressing fibroblasts significantly induced migration tendency in KYSE-30 cell line compared to the mock-transfected fibroblasts (P < 0.0001). In this system, MIF expression (a validated target of miR-451) in the KYSE-30 cell line was increased although this alteration was not statistically significant (fold change = 4.44). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that cancer-associated fibroblasts use exosomal miR-451 as a signaling molecule to provide a favorable niche for tumor cell migration and cancer progression. Our findings provide new insights into the stromal role of miR-451 in the esophageal tumor microenvironment as a communicatory molecule and suggest a signaling role for miR-451 in extracellular matrix cross-talks.

Nanomedicine	2017	The ability of exosomes to elicit specific cellular responses suggests that they may be increasingly used as therapeutics. Their vesicular nature makes them suitable as potential nanocarriers for drugs or nucleic acids delivery. Here we address the question whether the method of preparation of enriched exosomal fractions can affect their uptake by cells and their ability to trigger a response. We compared ultracentrifugation and polymer-based precipitation methods on supernatants of glioma-associated stem cells isolated from a high-grade glioma patient. We determined particle size distributions after purification and their correlation with uptake, proliferation and migration in glioblastoma cell cultures. Our findings indicate that polymer-based precipitation leads to smaller particle size distributions, faster uptake by target cells and increased cellular motility. The different effect that isolation method-dependent populations of particles have on cell motility suggests their size distribution could also profoundly affect exosomes therapeutic potential.

Adipose stem cell-derived nanovesicles inhibit emphysema primarily via an FGF2-dependent pathway.	Exp Mol Med	2017	Cell therapy using stem cells has produced therapeutic benefits in animal models of COPD. Secretory mediators are proposed as one mechanism for stem cell effects because very few stem cells engraft after injection into recipient animals. Recently, nanovesicles that overcome the disadvantages of natural exosomes have been generated artificially from cells. We generated artificial nanovesicles from adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) using sequential penetration through polycarbonate membranes. ASC-derived artificial nanovesicles displayed a 100 nm-sized spherical shape similar to ASC-derived natural exosomes and expressed both exosomal and stem cell markers. The proliferation rate of lung epithelial cells was increased in cells treated with ASC-derived artificial nanovesicles compared with cells treated with ASC-derived natural exosomes. The lower dose of ASC-derived artificial nanovesicles had similar regenerative capacity compared with a higher dose of ASCs and ASC-derived natural exosomes. In addition, FGF2 levels in the lungs of mice treated with ASC-derived artificial nanovesicles were increased. The uptake of ASC-derived artificial nanovesicles was inhibited by heparin, which is a competitive inhibitor of heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is associated with FGF2 signaling. Taken together, the data indicate that lower doses of ASC-derived artificial nanovesicles may have beneficial effects similar to higher doses of ASCs or ASC-derived natural exosomes in an animal model with emphysema, suggesting that artificial nanovesicles may have economic advantages that warrant future clinical studies.

The isolation of morphologically intact and biologically active extracellular vesicles from the secretome of cancer-associated adipose tissue.	Cell Adh Migr	2017	Breast cancer cells closely interact with different cell types of the surrounding adipose tissue to favor invasive growth and metastasis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanometer-sized vesicles secreted by different cell types that shuttle proteins and nucleic acids to establish cell-cell communication. To study the role of EVs released by cancer-associated adipose tissue in breast cancer progression and metastasis a standardized EV isolation protocol that obtains pure EVs and maintains their functional characteristics is required. We implemented differential ultracentrifugation as a pre-enrichment step followed by OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation (dUC-ODG) to isolate EVs from the conditioned medium of cancer-associated adipose tissue. A combination of immune-electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and Western blot analysis identified EVs that are enriched in flotillin-1, CD9 and CD63, and sized between 20 and 200 nm with a density of 1.076-1.125 g/ml. The lack of protein aggregates and cell organelle proteins confirmed the purity of the EV preparations. Next, we evaluated whether dUC-ODG isolated EVs are functionally active. ZR75.1 breast cancer cells treated with cancer-associated adipose tissue-secreted EVs from breast cancer patients showed an increased phosphorylation of CREB. MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with adipose tissue-derived EVs exhibited a stronger propensity to form cellular aggregates. In conclusion, dUC-ODG purifies EVs from conditioned medium of cancer-associated adipose tissue, and these EVs are morphologically intact and biologically active.	PMC5351718

METHODS: Rats subjected to 2 hours of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion were intravenously administered miR-17-92 cluster-enriched exosomes, control MSC exosomes, or liposomes and were euthanized 28 days post-middle cerebral artery occlusion. Histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and Golgi-Cox staining were used to assess dendritic, axonal, synaptic, and myelin remodeling. Expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog and activation of its downstream proteins, protein kinase B, mechanistic target of rapamycin, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β in the peri-infarct region were measured by means of Western blots. RESULTS: Compared with the liposome treatment, both exosome treatment groups exhibited significant improvement of functional recovery, but miR-17-92 cluster-enriched exosome treatment had significantly more robust effects on improvement of neurological function and enhancements of oligodendrogenesis, neurogenesis, and neurite remodeling/neuronal dendrite plasticity in the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) than the control MSC exosome treatment. Moreover, miR-17-92 cluster-enriched exosome treatment substantially inhibited phosphatase and tensin homolog, a validated miR-17-92 cluster target gene, and subsequently increased the phosphorylation of phosphatase and tensin homolog downstream proteins, protein kinase B, mechanistic target of rapamycin, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β compared with control MSC exosome treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that treatment of stroke with tailored exosomes enriched with the miR-17-92 cluster increases neural plasticity and functional recovery after stroke, possibly via targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog to activate the PI3K/protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin/glycogen synthase kinase 3β signaling pathway.

Chitosan Wound Dressings Incorporating Exosomes Derived from MicroRNA-126-Overexpressing Synovium Mesenchymal Stem Cells Provide Sustained Release of Exosomes and Heal Full-Thickness Skin Defects in a Diabetic Rat Model.	Stem Cells Transl Med	2017	There is a need to find better strategies to promote wound healing, especially of chronic wounds, which remain a challenge. We found that synovium mesenchymal stem cells (SMSCs) have the ability to strongly promote cell proliferation of fibroblasts; however, they are ineffective at promoting angiogenesis. Using gene overexpression technology, we overexpressed microRNA-126-3p (miR-126-3p) and transferred the angiogenic ability of endothelial progenitor cells to SMSCs, promoting angiogenesis. We tested a therapeutic strategy involving controlled-release exosomes derived from miR-126-3p-overexpressing SMSCs combined with chitosan. Our in vitro results showed that exosomes derived from miR-126-3p-overexpressing SMSCs (SMSC-126-Exos) stimulated the proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, SMSC-126-Exos also promoted migration and tube formation of HMEC-1. Testing this system in a diabetic rat model, we found that this approach resulted in accelerated re-epithelialization, activated angiogenesis, and promotion of collagen maturity in vivo. These data provide the first evidence of the potential of SMSC-126-Exos in treating cutaneous wounds and indicate that modifying the cells-for example, by gene overexpression-and using the exosomes derived from these modified cells provides a potential drug delivery system and could have infinite possibilities for future therapy.

Electronic address: .	pvader@umcutrecht.nl		Higher functionality of extracellular vesicles isolated using size-exclusion chromatography compared to ultracentrifugation.	Nanomedicine	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized, lipid bilayer-enclosed particles involved in intercellular communication. EVs are increasingly being considered as drug delivery vehicles or as cell-free approach to regenerative medicine. However, one of the major challenges for their clinical application is finding a scalable EV isolation method that yields functional EVs. Although the golden standard for EV isolation is ultracentrifugation (UC), a recent study suggested that isolation using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) yielded EVs with more intact biophysical properties. Whether this also leads to differences in functionality remained to be investigated. Therefore, we investigated possible differences in functionality of cardiomyocyte progenitor cell-derived EVs isolated using UC and SEC. Western blot analysis showed higher pERK/ERK ratios in endothelial cells after stimulation with SEC-EVs compared to UC-EVs, indicating that SEC-EVs bear higher functionality. Therefore, we propose to use SEC-EVs for further investigation of EVs' therapeutic potential. Further optimization of isolation protocols may accelerate clinical adoption of therapeutic EVs.

Investigation of Endocytic Pathways for the Internalization of Exosome-Associated Oligomeric Alpha-Synuclein.	Front Neurosci	2017	Misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (αsyn) resulting in cytotoxicity is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies. The recent body of evidence indicates that αsyn can be released from neuronal cells by nonconventional exocytosis involving extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes. The transfer of αsyn between cells has been proposed to be an important mechanism of disease propagation in PD. To date, exosome trafficking mechanisms, including release and cell-cell transmission, have not been fully described. To gain insight into the mechanisms involved, exosomes were purified from conditioned media of stable cells secreting αsyn oligomers. A novel bimolecular protein complementation assay was used to detect exosomes containing αsyn oligomers. Recipient cells were treated with exosomes containing αsyn oligomers or "free" non-exosome-associated αsyn oligomers and internalization was monitored. We demonstrate that cell-derived exosome-associated αsyn oligomers can be efficiently internalized by recipient cells. Interestingly exosome-free αsyn oligomers isolated from conditioned medium were not internalized but remained bound to the extracellular surface. To investigate the endocytic pathway(s) required for the exosome uptake different pharmacological inhibitors of caveolin-dependent, clathrin-dependent, and macropinocytosis pathways were utilized. Surprisingly, none of these pathways appear to play a significant role in the internalization of exosome-associated αsyn oligomers. Finally, the role of heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in exosome-associated αsyn internalization was investigated using genetic approach. Despite previous studies showing HSPGs can modulate internalization of fibrillar αsyn, genetic manipulations did not attenuate internalization of exosome-associated αsyn oligomers in our hands, suggesting that exosome-associated αsyn is internalized via an alternative endocytic pathway(s) that has yet to be elucidated.

Sci Rep	2017	Orchestration of bone repair processes requires crosstalk between different cell populations, including immune cells and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC). Extracellular vesicles (EV) as mediators of these interactions remain vastly unexplored. Here, we aimed to determine the mechanism of MSC recruitment by Dendritic Cells (DC), hypothesising that it would be mediated by EV. Primary human DC-secreted EV (DC-EV), isolated by ultracentrifugation, were characterized for their size, morphology and protein markers, indicating an enrichment in exosomes. DC-EV were readily internalized by human bone marrow-derived MSC, without impacting significantly their proliferation or influencing their osteogenic/chondrogenic differentiation. Importantly, DC-EV significantly and dose-dependently promoted MSC recruitment across a transwell system and enhanced MSC migration in a microfluidic chemotaxis assay. DC-EV content was analysed by chemokine array, indicating the presence of chemotactic mediators. Osteopontin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were confirmed inside EV. In summary, DC-EV are naturally loaded with chemoattractants and can contribute to cell recruitment, thus inspiring the development of new tissue regeneration strategies.	PMC5431789

Exosomes derived from hypoxic epithelial ovarian cancer deliver microRNA-940 to induce macrophage M2 polarization.	Oncol Rep	2017	Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors. It is closely related to tumor progression. Exosomal microRNAs derived from cancers are considered to be mediators between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. In addition, the number of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment has also been demonstrated to correlate with tumor development. However, the relationship between tumor-secreted exosomes and TAM polarization under hypoxic conditions during tumor progression is not clear. Herein, we demonstrated that hypoxia induces the high expression of microRNA-940 (miR‑940) in exosomes derived from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We also found that miR‑940 is highly expressed in exosomes isolated from ascites of EOC patients. Moreover, the overexpression of miR‑940 in macrophages delivered by exosomes stimulated M2 phenotype polarization, while the M2 subtype macrophages promoted EOC proliferation and migration. These results highlight the function of hypoxia in enhancing the high level of expression of miR‑940 in tumor exosomes taken up by macrophages. We also showed that the tumor-promoting function of miR‑940 is mediated by TAM polarization in EOC. These findings show that tumor-derived exosomal miR‑940 induced by hypoxia plays an important role in stimulating TAM polarization in the progression of EOC.

Circ Res	2017	RATIONALE: Myocardial delivery of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is an emerging therapy for treating the failing heart. However, the relative effects of hMSC-mediated heterocellular coupling (HC) and paracrine signaling (PS) on human cardiac contractility and arrhythmogenicity remain unresolved. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to better understand hMSC PS and HC effects on human cardiac contractility and arrhythmogenicity by integrating experimental and computational approaches. METHODS AND RESULTS: Extending our previous hMSC-cardiomyocyte HC computational model, we incorporated experimentally calibrated hMSC PS effects on cardiomyocyte L-type calcium channel/sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase activity and cardiac tissue fibrosis. Excitation-contraction simulations of hMSC PS-only and combined HC+PS effects on human cardiomyocytes were representative of human engineered cardiac tissue (hECT) contractile function measurements under matched experimental treatments. Model simulations and hECTs both demonstrated that hMSC-mediated effects were most pronounced under PS-only conditions, where developed force increased ≈4-fold compared with non-hMSC-supplemented controls during physiological 1-Hz pacing. Simulations predicted contractility of isolated healthy and ischemic adult human cardiomyocytes would be minimally sensitive to hMSC HC, driven primarily by PS. Dominance of hMSC PS was also revealed in simulations of fibrotic cardiac tissue, where hMSC PS protected from potential proarrhythmic effects of HC at various levels of engraftment. Finally, to study the nature of the hMSC paracrine effects on contractility, proteomic analysis of hECT/hMSC conditioned media predicted activation of PI3K/Akt signaling, a recognized target of both soluble and exosomal fractions of the hMSC secretome. Treating hECTs with exosome-enriched, but not exosome-depleted, fractions of the hMSC secretome recapitulated the effects observed with hMSC conditioned media on hECT-developed force and expression of calcium-handling genes (eg, SERCA2a, L-type calcium channel). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this integrated experimental and computational study helps unravel relative hMSC PS and HC effects on human cardiac contractility and arrhythmogenicity, and provides novel insight into the role of exosomes in hMSC paracrine-mediated effects on contractility.

Blood neuron-derived exosomes as biomarkers of cognitive impairment in HIV.	AIDS	2017	OBJECTIVE: To investigate proteins associated with neuronal damage in plasma neuron-derived exosomes (NDE) of HIV-infected study participants as a liquid biomarker for cognitive impairment. METHODS: Plasma NDE were isolated using precipitation and immunoadsorption with antibody to a cell surface-specific neuronal marker. Total exosomes and NDE were enumerated, characterized, and proteins extracted and targets quantified by ELISA. RESULTS: Plasma NDE from 23 HIV seropositive individuals of which 11 had mild cognitive impairment, and 12 HIV seronegative controls of which three had cognitive impairment were isolated. NDE were enriched for the neuronal markers neurofilament light (NF-L) and synaptophysin (SYP). Neuropsychologically impaired individuals had fewer NDE compared with neuropsychologically normal study participants. NDE from neuropsychologically impaired study participants had significantly higher levels of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), NF-L, and amyloid β proteins compared with neuropsychologically normal individuals. NDE HMGB1 protein significantly decreased with age in HIV-infected individuals. CONCLUSION: Plasma NDE were altered in several ways in HIV infection. Elevated HMGB1, NF-L, and amyloid β proteins could distinguish cognitive impairment. NDE contents reflect neuronal health in 'real time' and may be useful for following cognitive impairment and response to therapy in HIV infection.	PMC5578870

Sci Immunol	2017	In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), monocytes and macrophages are skewed toward protumorigenic phenotypes, including the release of tumor-supportive cytokines and the expression of immunosuppressive molecules such as programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). To understand the mechanism driving protumorigenic skewing in CLL, we evaluated the role of tumor cell-derived exosomes in the cross-talk with monocytes. We carried out RNA sequencing and proteome analyses of CLL-derived exosomes and identified noncoding Y RNA hY4 as a highly abundant RNA species that is enriched in exosomes from plasma of CLL patients compared with healthy donor samples. Transfer of CLL-derived exosomes or hY4 alone to monocytes resulted in key CLL-associated phenotypes, including the release of cytokines, such as C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL4, and interleukin-6, and the expression of PD-L1. These responses were abolished in Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)-deficient monocytes, suggesting exosomal hY4 as a driver of TLR7 signaling. Pharmacologic inhibition of endosomal TLR signaling resulted in a substantially reduced activation of monocytes in vitro and attenuated CLL development in vivo. Our results indicate that exosome-mediated transfer of noncoding RNAs to monocytes contributes to cancer-related inflammation and concurrent immune escape via PD-L1 expression.

Methods Mol Biol	2017	This chapter provides a description of some of the standard methods used for the isolation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from a variety of biological fluids, including cell culture media, urine, plasma and serum. The methods presented include ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, proprietary polymer-based reagents, size exclusion chromatography, density gradient separation, and immunoaffinity capture. Ultracentrifugation methods use high speed centrifugation to pellet vesicles, whilst polymer-based reagents are added to the sample to facilitate vesicle precipitation using lower speeds. Ultrafiltration involves the concentration of vesicles from a large volume of biological fluid using a centrifugal filter unit. Size exclusion chromatography and density gradient separation are both designed to allow the separation of vesicles from other nonvesicular debris. Immunoaffinity capture methods use antibody-coated beads to selectively isolate vesicles displaying a surface marker of interest. Ultimately, the choice of purification method for an individual experiment is influenced by time, cost, and equipment considerations, as well as the sample requirements for any downstream analyses.

Identification of miR-16 as an endogenous reference gene for the normalization of urinary exosomal miRNA expression data from CKD patients.	PLoS One	2017	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a severe disorder with an increasing incidence worldwide. An early detection may help to prevent its progression and to minimize the risk of cardiovascular diseases as one of the major comorbidities. Recently, extracellular miRNAs like urinary exosomal miRNAs became of great interest as non-invasive biomarkers which can be determined by RT-qPCR. But until now, there is no consensus regarding the normalization of miRNAs isolated from body fluids. The present study analyzed the miRNAs miR-16, miR-92a, miR-21, miR-124a and the small nuclear RNA RNU6B for their applicability as an endogenous reference gene in expression studies of exosomal miRNAs isolated from CKD patients. For this purpose, miRNA expression levels were determined by RT-qPCR after the isolation of urinary exosomes from 33 CKD patients and from 5 healthy controls. Expression data was analyzed with the normalization determination software NormFinder, BestKeeper, GeNorm and DeltaCt. Our results revealed an abundant expression of the four candidate miRNAs in urinary exosomes and no detectable expression of RNU6B. We identified miR-16 as the most stable endogenous reference gene in our data set, making it a suitable endogenous reference gene for miRNA studies of urinary exosomes derived from CKD patients.

Electronic address: .	pvader@umcutrecht.nl		Cellular uptake of extracellular vesicles is mediated by clathrin-independent endocytosis and macropinocytosis.	J Control Release	2017	Recent evidence has established that extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, form an endogenous transport system through which biomolecules, including proteins and RNA, are exchanged between cells. This endows EVs with immense potential for drug delivery and regenerative medicine applications. Understanding the biology underlying EV-based intercellular transfer of cargo is of great importance for the development of EV-based therapeutics. Here, we sought to characterize the cellular mechanisms involved in EV uptake. Internalization of fluorescently-labeled EVs was evaluated in HeLa cells, in 2D (monolayer) cell culture as well as 3D spheroids. Uptake was assessed using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, using chemical as well as RNA interference-based inhibition of key proteins involved in individual endocytic pathways. Experiments with chemical inhibitors revealed that EV uptake depends on cholesterol and tyrosine kinase activity, which are implicated in clathrin-independent endocytosis, and on Na+/H+ exchange and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity, which are important for macropinocytosis. Furthermore, EV internalization was inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of caveolin-1, flotillin-1, RhoA, Rac1 and PAK1, but not clathrin heavy chain. Together, these results suggest that EVs enter cells predominantly via clathrin-independent endocytosis and macropinocytosis. Identification of EV components that promote their uptake via pathways that lead to functional cargo transfer might allow development of more efficient therapeutics through EV-inspired engineering.

Pancreatic cancer-derived exosomes promote tumor metastasis and liver pre-metastatic niche formation.	Oncotarget	2017	Exosomes play important roles in cell-cell communication, and are likely mediators of the metastatic cascade in cancer. This study examined the role of exosomes in pancreatic cancer cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. We isolated and purified exosomes from two isogenic pancreatic cancer cell lines with different metastatic potentials. Uptake of exosomes from highly metastatic Panc02-H7 cells decreased adhesion and increased migration and invasion capacity in weakly metastatic Panc02 cells in vitro. Exosomes from highly metastatic pancreatic cancer cells induced liver pre-metastatic niche formation in naïve mice and promoted primary tumor growth and liver metastasis in vivo. We identified 4,517 proteins in exosomes from Panc02 and Panc02-H7 cells via iTRAQ quantitative proteomic analyses, 79 of which were differentially expressed between the two cell lines. Bioinformatics analyses showed that most of the differentially expressed proteins were involved in pancreatic cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis, and that metabolism-related signaling pathways were involved in exosome-mediated intracellular communication. Further studies will be needed to determine whether these proteins are potential pancreatic cancer diagnostic/prognostic markers or novel therapeutic targets.	PMC5609937

Hematopoietic stem cell-derived exosomes promote hematopoietic differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells in vitro via inhibiting the miR126/Notch1 pathway.	Acta Pharmacol Sin	2018	Cell-derived exosomes (EXs) can modulate target cell differentiation via microRNAs (miRs) that they carried. Previous studies have shown that miR126 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and plays a role in hematopoiesis via modulating the Notch pathway that participates in progenitors' cell fate decisions. In this study we investigated whether HSC-derived EXs (HSC-EXs) could affect the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into HSCs. We prepared HSC-EXscon, HSC-EXssc and HSC-EXsmiR126 from control HSCs and the HSCs transfected with scramble control or miR126 mimics, respectively. HSC-EXs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and analyzed using nanoparticle tracking analysis. We incubated the collected EXs with mouse ESCs over a 10-d differentiation induction period, during which HSC-EXs and a Notch pathway activator (Jagged1, 100 ng/mL) were added to the cultures every 3 d. After the 10-d differentiation period, the expression levels of miR126, SSEA1, CD117, Sca1, Notch1 and Hes1 in ESCs were assessed. The generated HSCs were validated by flow cytometry using antibodies against HSC markers (CD117, CD34 and Sca1). Our results revealed that: (1) transfection with miR126 mimics significantly increased miR126 levels in HSC-EXsmiR126. (2) HSC-EX co-culture promoted mouse ESCs differentiation into HSCs with the most prominent effect found in the HSC-EXsmiR126 co-culture. (3) HSC differentiation was verified by reduced SSEA1 expression and increased CD117 and Sca1 expression. (4) All the effects caused by HSC-EXs were accompanied by significant reduction of Notch1 and Hes1 expression, thus inhibition of the Notch1/Hes1 pathway, whereas activation of Notch by Jagged1 abolished the effects of HSC-EXsmiR126. In conclusion, HSC-EXs promote hematopoietic differentiation of mouse ESCs in vitro by inhibiting the miR126/Notch1 pathway.	PMC5888680

Biobehavioral modulation of the exosome transcriptome in ovarian carcinoma.	Cancer	2018	BACKGROUND: Social factors in the patient macroenvironment have been shown to influence molecular events in the tumor microenvironment and thereby influence cancer progression. However, biomarkers providing a window into the longitudinal effects of biobehavioral factors on tumor biology over time are lacking. Exosome analysis is a novel strategy for in vivo monitoring of dynamic changes in tumor cells. This study examined exosomal profiles from patients with low or high levels of social support for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) polarization and gene expression related to inflammation and β-adrenergic signaling. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from plasma sampled from a series of 40 women before primary surgical resection of advanced-stage, high-grade ovarian carcinoma. Samples were selected for analysis on the basis of extremes of low and high levels of social support. After exosomal isolation and RNA extraction, a microarray analysis of the transcriptome was performed. RESULTS: Primary analyses identified significant upregulation of 67 mesenchymal-characteristic gene transcripts and downregulation of 63 epithelial-characteristic transcripts in patients with low social support; this demonstrated increased EMT polarization (P = .0002). Secondary analyses using promoter sequence bioinformatics supported a priori hypotheses linking low social support to 1) increased activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB)/activating transcription factor (ATF) family transcription factors that mediate the β-adrenergic response to catecholamines via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A signaling pathway (mean fold change for CREB: 2.24 ± 0.65; P = .0019; mean fold change for ATF: 2.00 ± 0.55; P = .0049) and 2) increased activity of the proinflammatory nuclear factor κB/Rel family of transcription factors (mean fold change: 2.10 ± 0.70; P = .0109). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the possibility of leveraging exosomes as a noninvasive assessment of biobehavioral factors to help to direct personalized treatment approaches.

Exosomes and Metabolic Function in Mice Exposed to Alternating Dark-Light Cycles Mimicking Night Shift Work Schedules.	Front Physiol	2017	Sleep is an important modulator of metabolic function. Disruptions of sleep in circadian rhythm are common in modern societies and are associated with increased risk of developing cardiometabolic disorders. Exosomes are ubiquitous extracellular vesicles that may play a mechanistic role in metabolic derangements. We hypothesized that alternating dark-light cycles mimicking shift work in mice would alter fecal microbiota and colonic epithelium permeability and alter plasma exosome cargo and metabolic function. C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to (i) control day light (CL), or (ii) inverted dark-light every 2 weeks for 8 weeks (IN). Body weight, fat mass and HOMA-IR were measured, along with Tregs, metabolic, and resident macrophages in visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT). Fecal water samples were incubated with confluent colonic epithelium cell cultures in electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) arrays, and plasma exosomes were added to differentiated adipocytes and insulin-induced pAKT/AKT expression changes were assessed by western blots. Mice exposed to IN showed elevated HOMA-IR, and their fecal samples showed altered microbiota which promote increased permeability of the colonic epithelial cell barrier. Plasma exosomes decreased pAKT/AKT responses to exogenous insulin compared to CL, and altered expression of circadian clock genes. Inflammatory macrophages (Ly-6chigh) were increased in IN-exposed vWAT, while Tregs were decreased. Thus, gut microbiota and the cargo of plasma exosomes are altered by periodic shifts in environmental lighting, and effectively alter metabolic function, possibly via induction of systemic inflammation and altered clock expression in target tissues. Further exploration of exosomal miRNA signatures in shift workers and their putative metabolic organ cell targets appears warranted.	PMC5673652

MicroRNA expression profiling in exosomes derived from gastric cancer stem-like cells.	Oncotarget	2017	Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) have been identified as the initial cell in formation of cancer. Quiescent CSCs can "hide out" from traditional cancer therapy which may produce an initial response but are often unsuccessful in curing patients. Thus, levels of CSC in patients may be used as an indicator to measure the chance of recurrence of cancer after therapy. The goals of our work are to develop specific exosomal miRNA clusters for gastric CSCs that can potentially predict which patients are at high risk for developing gastric cancer (GC) in order to diagnose GC at an early stage. Here, upon sorting gastric CSCs, we initially isolated and characterized exosomes secreted by both gastric CSCs and their differentiated cells (DCs). By deep sequencing of each exosomal miRNA library, 11 typical differentially expressed miRNAs were identified as signature miRNAs for CSC. Gene target prediction, GO annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed possible functions associated with these signature miRNAs. Hence, upon research of exosomal miRNAs that would influence behavior of tumor cells and their microenvironment, this study shows that a specific miRNA signature is present in CSCs, and implies that a potential miRNA biomarker reflecting the stage of gastric cancer progression and metastasis could be developed in the foreseeable future.

Exosomes serve as nanoparticles to suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis in gastric cancer by delivering hepatocyte growth factor siRNA.	Cancer Sci	2018	Exosomes derived from cells have been found to mediate signal transduction between cells and to act as efficient carriers to deliver drugs and small RNA. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is known to promote the growth of both cancer cells and vascular cells, and the HGF-cMET pathway is a potential clinical target. Here, we characterized the inhibitory effect of HGF siRNA on tumor growth and angiogenesis in gastric cancer. In addition, we showed that HGF siRNA packed in exosomes can be transported into cancer cells, where it dramatically downregulates HGF expression. A cell co-culture model was used to show that exosomes loaded with HGF siRNA suppress proliferation and migration of both cancer cells and vascular cells. Moreover, exosomes were able to transfer HGF siRNA in vivo, decreasing the growth rates of tumors and blood vessels. The results of our study demonstrate that exosomes have potential for use in targeted cancer therapy by delivering siRNA.	PMC5834801

Role of exosomes and exosomal microRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma: Potential in diagnosis and antitumour treatments (Review).	Int J Mol Med	2018	Communication between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and their environment is essential for the development and progression of HCC. Exosomes, which are microvesicles secreted by a number of cell types, are carriers of intercellular information and regulate the tumour microenvironment. Studies have demonstrated that exosomes are involved in the communication between HCC cells, endothelial cells and stem cells, and that they serve important roles in the metastasis and invasion, immune evasion and immunotherapy of HCC. In addition, the mechanism of HCC‑derived exosome‑mediated microRNA (miRNA) transfer is important in the environmental modulation of HCC growth and progression. As exosomes can be used for detecting and monitoring HCC, they can potentially serve as specific biomarkers for early‑stage tumours and the tumour metastasis of HCC. Moreover, mesenchymal stem cell‑derived exosomes can be transfected with miRNAs to inhibit HCC development. Therefore, as nucleic acid delivery vehicles, exosomes show a tremendous potential for effective treatment against HCC. In the present review, recent advances in our understanding of the source, composition and function of exosomes in HCC, and their potential value in the early diagnosis and treatment of HCC, are summarized.

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2018	BACKGROUND: Adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs)-derived exosomes (ADSC-Exos) account for the proangiogenic potential of stem cell. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ADSC-derived exosomes (ADSC-Exos) on the survival in fat grafting. METHODS: A nude mouse model of subcutaneous fat grafting was adopted. Hypoxic preconditioned ADSC-Exos and ADSC-Exos were injected around the grafted tissue. The fat graft sample was weighed and examined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry. Laser Doppler flowmetry and CD31 immunofluorescence staining were used to analyze neovascularization. RESULTS: ADSC-Exo and hypoxic ADSC-Exo groups had a significantly higher weight of fat graft and more perilipin-positive adipocytes than the control groups from 2 to 8 weeks after grafting, and the hypoxic ADSC-Exo group had better outcomes (all P < 0.05). H&E staining showed that ADSC-Exos attenuated infiltration of inflammatory cells around the fat grafts. Laser Doppler flowmetry showed that the two ADSC-Exo groups had better blood perfusion in the graft tissue than the control groups (all P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence demonstrated that the hypoxic ADSC-Exo group had significantly more CD31-positive cells than the ADSC-Exo group. In vitro study showed that hypoxic ADSC-Exos treatment significantly increased the migration (at 12 and 24 h) and in vitro capillary network formation (at 12 h) in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as compared with the ADSC-Exo group and control group (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Co-transplantation of ADSC-Exos can effectively promote the survival of graft, neovascularization and attenuated inflammation in the fat grafts. Hypoxia treatment can further enhance the beneficial effect of ADSC-Exos.

Stem Cell Reports	2018	Genetic deficiency of dystrophin leads to disability and premature death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), affecting the heart as well as skeletal muscle. Here, we report that clinical-stage cardiac progenitor cells, known as cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), improve cardiac and skeletal myopathy in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Injection of CDCs into the hearts of mdx mice augments cardiac function, ambulatory capacity, and survival. Exosomes secreted by human CDCs reproduce the benefits of CDCs in mdx mice and in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived Duchenne cardiomyocytes. Surprisingly, CDCs and their exosomes also transiently restored partial expression of full-length dystrophin in mdx mice. The findings further motivate the testing of CDCs in Duchenne patients, while identifying exosomes as next-generation therapeutic candidates.	PMC5918344

AAPS J	2018	Current cancer diagnostic methods are challenged by low sensitivity, high false positive rate, limited tumor information, uncomfortable or invasive procedures, and high cost. Liquid biopsy that analyzes circulating biomarkers in body fluids represents a promising solution to these challenges. Exosomes are one of the promising cancer biomarkers for liquid biopsy because they are cell-secreted, nano-sized, extracellular vesicles that stably exist in all types of body fluids. Exosomes transfer DNAs, RNAs, proteins, and lipids from parent cells to recipient cells for intercellular communication and play important roles in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. Many liquid biopsy biosensors have been developed to offer non- or minimally-invasive, highly sensitive, simple, rapid, and cost-effective cancer diagnostics. This review summarized recent advances of liquid biopsy biosensors with a focus on the detection of exosomal proteins as biomarkers for cancer screening, diagnosis, and prognosis. We reviewed six major types of liquid biopsy biosensors including immunofluorescence biosensor, colorimetric biosensor, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) biosensor, electrochemical biosensor, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) biosensor. We shared our perspectives on future improvement of exosome-based liquid biopsy biosensors to accelerate their clinical translation.

Targeting regenerative exosomes to myocardial infarction using cardiac homing peptide.	Theranostics	2018	Rationale: Cardiac stem cell-derived exosomes have been demonstrated to promote cardiac regeneration following myocardial infarction in preclinical studies. Recent studies have used intramyocardial injection in order to concentrate exosomes in the infarct. Though effective in a research setting, this method is not clinically appealing due to its invasive nature. We propose the use of a targeting peptide, cardiac homing peptide (CHP), to target intravenously-infused exosomes to the infarcted heart. Methods: Exosomes were conjugated with CHP through a DOPE-NHS linker. Ex vivo targeting was analyzed by incubating organ sections with the CHP exosomes and analyzing with fluorescence microscopy. In vitro assays were performed on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9C2 cells. For the animal study, we utilized an ischemia/reperfusion rat model. Animals were treated with either saline, scramble peptide exosomes, or CHP exosomes 24 h after surgery. Echocardiography was performed 4 h after surgery and 21 d after surgery. At 21 d, animals were sacrificed, and organs were collected for analysis. Results: By conjugating the exosomes with CHP, we demonstrate increased retention of the exosomes within heart sections ex vivo and in vitro with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. In vitro studies showed improved viability, reduced apoptosis and increased exosome uptake when using CHP-XOs. Using an animal model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, we measured the heart function, infarct size, cellular proliferation, and angiogenesis, with improved outcomes with the CHP exosomes. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a novel method for increasing delivery of for treatment of myocardial infarction. By targeting exosomes to the infarcted heart, there was a significant improvement in outcomes with reduced fibrosis and scar size, and increased cellular proliferation and angiogenesis.	PMC5858505

Loading MiR-210 in Endothelial Progenitor Cells Derived Exosomes Boosts Their Beneficial Effects on Hypoxia/Reoxygeneation-Injured Human Endothelial Cells via Protecting Mitochondrial Function.	Cell Physiol Biochem	2018	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Stem cell-derived exosomes (EXs) offer protective effects on various cells via their carried microRNAs (miRs). Meanwhile, miR-210 has been shown to reduce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction. In this study, we determined the potential effects of endothelial progenitor cell-derived EXs (EPC-EXs) on hypoxia/ reoxygenation (H/R) injured endothelial cells (ECs) and investigated whether these effects could be boosted by miR-210 loading. METHODS: Human EPCs were used to generate EPC-EXs, or transfected with scrambler control or miR-210 mimics to generate EPC-EXssc and EPC-EXsmiR-210. H/R-injured human ECs were used as a model for functional analysis of EXs on apoptosis, viability, ROS production and angiogenic ability (migration and tube formation) by flow cytometry, MTT, dihydroethidium and angiogenesis assay kits, respectively. For mechanism analysis, the mitochondrion morphology, membrane potential (MMP), ATP level and the expression of fission/fusion proteins (dynamin-related protein 1: drp1 and mitofusin-2: mfn2) were assessed by using JC-1 staining, ELISA and western blot, respectively. RESULTS: 1) Transfection of miR-210 mimics into EPCs induced increase of miR-210 in EPC-EXsmiR-210 without change of average size; 2) EPC-EXsmiR-210, but not EPC-EXs or EPC-EXssc, significantly elevated miR-210 level in ECs; 3) EPC-EXsmiR-210 were more effective than EPC-EXs and EPC-EXssc in reducing H/R-induced EC apoptosis, ROS overproduction and angiogenic dysfunction; 4) EPC-EXs decreased mitochondrial fragmentation, elevated MMP and ATP level, as well as improved mitochondrial mfn2 and drp1 dysregulation, which were more effective in EPC-EXsmiR-210. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that EPC-EXs protect ECs against H/R injury via improving mitochondrial function and miR-210 enrichment could boost their effects.

JCI Insight	2018	Exosomes are extracellular vesicles produced by all cells with a remarkable ability to efficiently transfer genetic material, including exogenously loaded siRNA, to cancer cells. Here, we report on a bioreactor-based, large-scale production of clinical-grade exosomes employing good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards. A standard operating procedure was established to generate engineered exosomes with the ability to target oncogenic Kras (iExosomes). The clinical-grade GMP iExosomes were tested in multiple in vitro and in vivo studies to confirm suppression of oncogenic Kras and an increase in the survival of several mouse models with pancreatic cancer. We perform studies to determine the shelf life, biodistribution, toxicology profile, and efficacy in combination with chemotherapy to inform future clinical testing of GMP iExosomes. Collectively, this report illustrates the process and feasibility of generating clinical-grade exosomes for various therapies of human diseases.	PMC5931131

Enhanced Production of Exosome-Associated AAV by Overexpression of the Tetraspanin CD9.	Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev	2018	Research on cell-free vesicles revealed a multitude of characteristics, in particular of microvesicles and exosomes, that range from their potential as biomarkers to a function in horizontal transfer of genetic information from cell to cell and also include supportive functions in viral infection. Exosome-associated adeno-associated viruses (exo-AAVs) are of particular interest for the past couple of years, because they introduced a new source of highly potent recombinant AAVs with improved features, including accelerated transduction rates and more efficient immune escape. However, key factors like the mode of action, efficiency of production, or engineering of exo-AAVs remain elusive to a large extent. Here, we used the established system of CD9 overexpression to boost the exosome output of AAV producing HEK-AAV cells. The CD9-powered high-exosome environment was established during exo-AAV1 production, and we could demonstrate that the yield of exo-AAVs dramatically increased when compared to standard exo-AAVs. Furthermore, we report that exo-AAV-CD9GFP was more efficient in transduction of cells in the same titer ranges as standard exo-AAVs. Our results provide a technological approach for the generation of exo-AAVs with superior performance.	PMC5918177

Hookworm Secreted Extracellular Vesicles Interact With Host Cells and Prevent Inducible Colitis in Mice.	Front Immunol	2018	Gastrointestinal (GI) parasites, hookworms in particular, have evolved to cause minimal harm to their hosts, allowing them to establish chronic infections. This is mediated by creating an immunoregulatory environment. Indeed, hookworms are such potent suppressors of inflammation that they have been used in clinical trials to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and celiac disease. Since the recent description of helminths (worms) secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosome-like EVs from different helminths have been characterized and their salient roles in parasite-host interactions have been highlighted. Here, we analyze EVs from the rodent parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, which has been used as a model for human hookworm infection. N. brasiliensis EVs (Nb-EVs) are actively internalized by mouse gut organoids, indicating a role in driving parasitism. We used proteomics and RNA-Seq to profile the molecular composition of Nb-EVs. We identified 81 proteins, including proteins frequently present in exosomes (like tetraspanin, enolase, 14-3-3 protein, and heat shock proteins), and 27 sperm-coating protein-like extracellular proteins. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 52 miRNA species, many of which putatively map to mouse genes involved in regulation of inflammation. To determine whether GI nematode EVs had immunomodulatory properties, we assessed their potential to suppress GI inflammation in a mouse model of inducible chemical colitis. EVs from N. brasiliensis but not those from the whipworm Trichuris muris or control vesicles from grapes protected against colitic inflammation in the gut of mice that received a single intraperitoneal injection of EVs. Key cytokines associated with colitic pathology (IL-6, IL-1β, IFNγ, and IL-17a) were significantly suppressed in colon tissues from EV-treated mice. By contrast, high levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were detected in Nb-EV-treated mice. Proteins and miRNAs contained within helminth EVs hold great potential application in development of drugs to treat helminth infections as well as chronic non-infectious diseases resulting from a dysregulated immune system, such as IBD.

The exosome pathway in K562 cells is regulated by Rab11.	J Cell Sci	2002	During maturation, reticulocytes lose some membrane proteins that are not required on the mature red cell surface. The proteins are released into the extracellular medium associated with vesicles that are formed by budding of the endosomal membrane into the lumen of the compartment; this process results in the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane results in secretion of the small internal vesicles, termed exosomes. K562 cells release exosomes with similar characteristics to reticulocyte exosomes, in particular the transferrin receptor (TfR) is found associated with the vesicles. Interestingly, this cell line has been shown to possess high amounts of Rab11 compared with other Rab proteins. To assess the regulation of transferrin receptor release via exosome secretion by Rab11 in this cell type, K562 cells were stably transfected with GFP-Rab11wt or the GTP- and GDP-locked mutants. The distribution of the proteins was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Transferrin recycling and the number of TfRs present on the surface of the transfected cells were reduced by overexpression of either Rab11wt or the mutants. The amount of released exosomes was analyzed by measuring different molecular markers present on these vesicles either biochemically or by western blot. Overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant Rab11S25N inhibited exosome release, whereas the secretion of exosomes was slightly stimulated in cells transfected with Rab11wt. Taken together, the results demonstrate that in K562 cells Rab11 modulates the exosome pathway although the exact step involved is still not known.

Characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nop17p, a novel Nop58p-interacting protein that is involved in Pre-rRNA processing.	J Mol Biol	2005	In eukaryotes, pre-rRNA processing depends on cis-acting elements and on a large number of non-ribosomal trans-acting factors, including endonucleases and exonucleases, RNA helicases, rRNA modifying enzymes and components of snoRNPs. The exosome is a conserved eukaryotic protein complex containing multiple 3'-5' exonucleases, which has been implicated in pre-rRNA, snoRNA and snRNA processing, as well as in mRNA degradation. In order to identify new proteins involved in rRNA processing, we have screened a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library, to isolate proteins interacting with the exosome subunit Rrp43p. In this screen, a novel nucleolar protein, Nop17p, was identified which also interacts with the box C/D snoRNP protein Nop58p. The NOP17 gene is not essential for cell viability but its deletion causes a temperature-sensitive phenotype. Pre-rRNA processing analyses revealed that rRNA formation is affected in the Deltanop17 strain subjected to the non-permissive temperature, although it is not blocked completely. In addition, primer extension analyses of RNA isolated from Nop17p-depleted cells subjected to the non-permissive temperature indicates that the pre-rRNA is undergoing different modification or degradation processes in these cells as compared to the parental strain. Nop17p was recently described in the same complex as Nop58p and, interestingly, its depletion leads to mislocalization of Nop1p, Nop56p, Nop58p and Snu13p, which are the core proteins of the box C/D ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP), indicating that Nop17p function is required either for nucleolar retention or for the proper assembly of the box C/D snoRNP.

Retrovirology	2006	BACKGROUND: Retroviruses have evolved various mechanisms to optimize their transfer to new target cells via late endosomes. Here, we analyzed the transfer of ZAM, a retroelement from Drosophila melanogaster, from ovarian follicle cells to the oocyte at stage 9-10 of oogenesis, when an active yolk transfer is occurring between these two cell types. RESULTS: Combining genetic and microscopic approaches, we show that a functional secretory apparatus is required to tether ZAM to endosomal vesicles and to direct its transport to the apical side of follicle cells. There, ZAM egress requires an intact follicular epithelium communicating with the oocyte. When gap junctions are inhibited or yolk receptors mutated, ZAM particles fail to sort out the follicle cells. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results indicate that retrotransposons do not exclusively perform intracellular replication cycles but may usurp exosomal/endosomal traffic to be routed from one cell to another.

Tumor exosomes inhibit differentiation of bone marrow dendritic cells.	J Immunol	2007	The production of exosomes by tumor cells has been implicated in tumor-associated immune suppression. In this study, we show that, in mice, exosomes produced by TS/A murine mammary tumor cells target CD11b(+) myeloid precursors in the bone marrow (BM) in vivo, and that this is associated with an accumulation of myeloid precursors in the spleen. Moreover, we demonstrate that TS/A exosomes block the differentiation of murine myeloid precursor cells into dendritic cells (DC) in vitro. Addition of tumor exosomes at day 0 led to a significant block of differentiation into DC, whereas addition at later time points was less effective. Similarly, exosomes produced by human breast tumor cells inhibited the differentiation of human monocytes in vitro. The levels of IL-6 and phosphorylated Stat3 were elevated 12 h after the tumor exosome stimulation of murine myeloid precursors, and tumor exosomes were less effective in inhibiting differentiation of BM cells isolated from IL-6 knockout mice. Addition of a rIL-6 to the IL-6 knockout BM cell culture restored the tumor exosome-mediated inhibition of DC differentiation. These data suggest that tumor exosome-mediated induction of IL-6 plays a role in blocking BM DC differentiation.

Int J Nanomedicine	2007	Exosomes are naturally occurring nanovesicles that can be tailored to display a broad range of drug targets, including G protein-coupled receptors. Such vesicles provide a new source of complex membrane proteins that are maintained in their native conformation. Given the difficulties to isolate receptors for drug target validation and discovery, receptor presentation on exosome emerges as a promising new tool for drug screening. The potential of this technology is illustrated here with recombinant exosomes presenting the somatostatin receptor 2 as an example. The receptor-containing vesicles were identified as exosomes since they also bear Lactadherin, a hallmark of exosome nanovesicles. The amount of somatostatin receptor 2 on exosomes was similar to the amount of the most abundant known exosome membrane proteins. The receptor was functional and similar in size to the form found on cell surface. Finally, recombinant exosomes were used in several assay formats that exemplify their capacity as a new receptor presentation platform for drug discovery. These include the induction and detection of antibody as well as screening of antibody repertoires without the need to purify membrane proteins.	PMC2676799

Detection of microRNA expression in human peripheral blood microvesicles.	PLoS One	2008	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate translation of mRNA and protein. Loss or enhanced expression of miRNAs is associated with several diseases, including cancer. However, the identification of circulating miRNA in healthy donors is not well characterized. Microvesicles, also known as exosomes or microparticles, circulate in the peripheral blood and can stimulate cellular signaling. In this study, we hypothesized that under normal healthy conditions, microvesicles contain miRNAs, contributing to biological homeostasis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Microvesicles were isolated from the plasma of normal healthy individuals. RNA was isolated from both the microvesicles and matched mononuclear cells and profiled for 420 known mature miRNAs by real-time PCR. Hierarchical clustering of the data sets indicated significant differences in miRNA expression between peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma microvesicles. We observed 71 miRNAs co-expressed between microvesicles and PBMC. Notably, we found 33 and 4 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs in the plasma microvesicles and mononuclear cells, respectively. Prediction of the gene targets and associated biological pathways regulated by the detected miRNAs was performed. The majority of the miRNAs expressed in the microvesicles from the blood were predicted to regulate cellular differentiation of blood cells and metabolic pathways. Interestingly, a select few miRNAs were also predicted to be important modulators of immune function. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to identify and define miRNA expression in circulating plasma microvesicles of normal subjects. The data generated from this study provides a basis for future studies to determine the predictive role of peripheral blood miRNA signatures in human disease and will enable the definition of the biological processes regulated by these miRNA.

The surface-exposed chaperone, Hsp60, is an agonist of the microglial TREM2 receptor.	J Neurochem	2009	Triggering receptor expressed in myeloid (TREM) cells 2, a receptor expressed by myeloid cells, osteoclasts and microglia, is known to play a protective role in bones and brain. Mutations of the receptor (or of its coupling protein, DAP12) sustain in fact a genetic disease affecting the two organs, the polycystic lipomembraneous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL or Nasu-Hakola disease). So far, specific agonist(s) of TREM2 have not been identified and its (their) transduction mechanisms are largely unknown. Heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) is a mitochondrial chaperone that can also be harboured at the cell surface. By using constructs including the extracellular domain of TREM2 and the Fc domain of IgGs we have identified Hsp60 as the only TREM2-binding protein exposed at the surface of neuroblastoma N2A cells and astrocytes, and lacking in U373 astrocytoma. Treatment with Hsp60 was found to stimulate the best known TREM2-dependent process, phagocytosis, however, only in the microglial N9 cells rich in the receptor. Upon TREM2 down-regulation, the Hsp60-induced stimulation of N9 phagocytosis was greatly attenuated. Hsp60 is also released by many cell types, segregated within exosomes or shedding vesicles which might then undergo dissolution. However, the affinity of its binding (K(d) = 3.8 microM) might be too low for the soluble chaperone released from the vesicles to the extracellular space to induce a significant activation of TREM2. It might in contrast be appropriate for the binding of TREM2 to Hsp60 exposed at the surface of cells closely interacting with microglia. The ensuing stimulation of phagocytosis could play protective effects on the brain.

Differential mechanisms of shedding of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored NKG2D ligands.	J Biol Chem	2010	Tumor cells release NKG2D ligands to evade NKG2D-mediated immune surveillance. The purpose of our investigation was to explore the cellular mechanisms of release used by various members of the ULBP family. Using biochemical and cellular approaches in both transfectant systems and tumor cell lines, this paper shows that ULBP1, ULBP2, and ULBP3 are released from cells with different kinetics and by distinct mechanisms. Whereas ULBP2 is mainly shed by metalloproteases, ULBP3 is abundantly released as part of membrane vesicles known as exosomes. Interestingly, exosomal ULBP3 protein is much more potent for down-modulation of the NKG2D receptor than soluble ULBP2 protein. This is the first report showing functionally relevant differences in the biochemistry of the three members of the ULBP family and confirms that in depth study of the biochemical features of individual NKG2D ligands will be necessary to understand and manipulate the biology of these proteins for therapy.

20617119	Arturo Casadevall				Vesicular Trans-Cell Wall Transport in Fungi: A Mechanism for the Delivery of Virulence-Associated Macromolecules?	Lipid Insights	2008	Fungal cells are encaged in rigid, complex cell walls. Until recently, there was remarkably little information regarding the trans-fungal cell wall transfer of intracellular macromolecules to the extracellular space. Recently, several studies have begun to elucidate the mechanisms that fungal cells utilize to secrete a wide variety of macromolecules through the cell wall. The combined use of transmission electron microscopy, serology, biochemistry, proteomics and lipidomics have revealed that the fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Sporothrix schenckii, as well as the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, each produces extracellular vesicles that carry lipids, proteins, polysaccharides and pigment-like structures of unquestionable biological significance. Compositional analysis of the C. neoformans and H. capsulatum extracellular vesicles suggests that they may function as 'virulence bags', with the potential to modulate the host-pathogen interaction in favor of the fungus. The cellular origin of the extracellular vesicles remains unknown, but morphological and biochemical features indicate that they are similar to the well-described mammalian exosomes.	PMC2898286

AlphaB-crystallin is found in detergent-resistant membrane microdomains and is secreted via exosomes from human retinal pigment epithelial cells.	J Biol Chem	2011	αB-crystallin (αB) is known as an intracellular Golgi membrane-associated small heat shock protein. Elevated levels of this protein have been linked with a myriad of neurodegenerative pathologies including Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, and age-related macular degeneration. The membrane association of αB has been known for more than 3 decades, yet its physiological import has remained unexplained. In this investigation we show that αB is secreted from human adult retinal pigment epithelial cells via microvesicles (exosomes), independent of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi protein export pathway. The presence of αB in these lipoprotein structures was confirmed by its susceptibility to digestion by proteinase K only when exosomes were exposed to Triton X-100. Transmission electron microscopy was used to localize αB in immunogold-labeled intact and permeabilized microvesicles. The saucer-shaped exosomes, with a median diameter of 100-200 nm, were characterized by the presence of flotillin-1, α-enolase, and Hsp70, the same proteins that associate with detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (DRMs), which are known to be involved in their biogenesis. Notably, using polarized adult retinal pigment epithelial cells, we show that the secretion of αB is predominantly apical. Using OptiPrep gradients we demonstrate that αB resides in the DRM fraction. The secretion of αB is inhibited by the cholesterol-depleting drug, methyl β-cyclodextrin, suggesting that the physiological function of this protein and the regulation of its export through exosomes may reside in its association with DRMs/lipid rafts.

Methods Mol Biol	2011	While the existence of exosomes has been known for over three decades, they have garnered recent interest due to their potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. The expression and release of specific tumor-derived proteins into the peripheral circulation has served as the centerpiece of cancer screening and diagnosis. Recently, tissue-associated microRNA (miRNA) has been shown to be characteristic of tumor type and developmental origin, as well as exhibit diagnostic potential. Tumors actively release exosomes, exhibiting proteins and RNAs derived from the originating cell, into the peripheral circulation and other biologic fluids. Recently, we have demonstrated the presence of miRNAs within the RNA fraction of circulating tumor-derived exosomes. Currently, in over 75 investigations compiled in ExoCarta, over 2,300 proteins and 270 miRNAs have been linked with exosomes derived from biologic fluids. Our previous work has indicated that these circulating exosomal proteins and miRNAs can serve as surrogates for the tumor cell-associated counterparts, extending their diagnostic potential to asymptomatic individuals. In this chapter, we compare currently utilized methods for purifying exosomes for postisolation analyses. The exosomes derived from these approaches were assessed for quantity and quality of specific RNA populations and specific marker proteins. These results suggest that, while each method purifies exosomal material, circulating exosomes isolated by ExoQuick precipitation produces exosomal RNA and protein with greater purity and quantity than chromatography, ultracentrifugation, and DynaBeads. While this precipitation approach isolates exosomes in general and does not exhibit specificity for the originating cell, the increased quantity and quality of exosomal proteins and RNA should enhance the sensitivity and accuracy of down-stream analyses, such as qRT-PCR profiling of miRNA and mass spectrometric and electrophoretic analyses of exosomal proteins.

Induction of a tumour-specific CTL response by exosomes isolated from heat-treated malignant ascites of gastric cancer patients.	Int J Hyperthermia	2011	PURPOSE: Tumour cell-derived exosomes may represent a novel type of cancer vaccine. However, the immunogenicity of exosomes derived from tumour cells has been shown to be poor. Therefore, in this study, exosome immunogenicity following heat treatment of exosomes from malignant ascites obtained from gastric cancer patients was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumour-derived exosomes were isolated from heat-treated and untreated malignant ascites of gastric cancer patients using serial centrifugation and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Next, in vitro experiments were performed to investigate the influence of heat treatment on exosome immunogenicity. RESULTS: Exosomes from heat-treated malignant ascites of gastric cancer patients (HS exosomes) were found to contain higher concentrations of heat shock proteins, Hsp70 and Hsp60, than exosomes derived from untreated malignant ascites obtained from gastric cancer patients. Additional in vitro studies suggest that exosomes derived from heat-treated malignant ascites are able to promote dendritic cell (DC) maturation and induce a tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results demonstrate that exposure to heat stress can improve the immunogenicity of exosomes obtained from malignant ascites of gastric cancer patients.

J Transl Med	2012	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are released from multiple cell types, contain protein and RNA species, and have been exploited as a novel reservoir for disease biomarker discovery. They can transfer information between cells and may cause pathology, for example, a role for exosomes has been proposed in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Although studied in several biofluids, exosomes have not been extensively studied in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from humans. The objective of this study was to determine: 1) whether human CSF contains exosomes and 2) the variability in exosomal protein content across individuals. METHODS: CSF was collected from 5 study participants undergoing thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (around 200 - 500 ml per participant) and low-density membrane vesicles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. The presence of exosomes was determined by western blot for marker proteins, isopycnic centrifugation on a sucrose step gradient and transmission electron microscopy with immuno-labelling. Whole protein profiling was performed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR). RESULTS: Flotillin 1 and tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), two exosomal marker proteins, were identified in the ultracentrifugation pellet using western blot. These markers localized to a density consistent with exosomes following isopycnic centrifugation. Transmission electron microscopy visualized structures consistent with exosomes in size and appearance that labelled positive for flotillin 1. Therefore, the pellet that resulted from ultracentrifugation of human CSF contained exosomes. FT-ICR profiling of this pellet was performed and 84-161 ions were detected per study participant. Around one third of these ions were only present in a single study participant and one third were detected in all five. With regard to ion quantity, the median coefficient of variation was 81% for ions detected in two or more samples. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes were identified in human CSF and their proteome is a potential new reservoir for biomarker discovery in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, techniques used to concentrate exosomes from CSF need refinement to reduce variability. In this study we used relatively large starting volumes of human CSF, future studies will focus on exosome isolation from smaller 'real life' clinical samples; a key challenge in the development of exosomes as translational tools.

Microparticles as immune regulators in infectious disease - an opinion.	Front Immunol	2011	Despite their clear relationship to immunology, few existing studies have examined the potential role of microparticles (MP) in infectious disease. MP have a different size range from exosomes and apoptotic bodies, with which they are often grouped and arise by different mechanisms in association with inflammatory cytokine action or stress on the source cell. Infection with pathogens usually leads to the expression of a range of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as significant stress in both infected and uninfected cells. It is thus reasonable to infer that infection-associated inflammation also leads to MP production. MP are produced by most of the major cell types in the immune system, and appear to be involved at both innate and adaptive levels, potentially serving different functions in each. Thus, they do not appear to have a universal function; instead their functions are source- or stimulus-dependent, although likely to be primarily either pro- or anti-inflammatory. We argue that in infectious diseases, MP may be able to deliver antigen, derived from the biological cargo acquired from their cells of origin, to antigen-presenting cells. Another potential benefit of MP would be to transfer and/or disseminate phenotype and function to target cells. However, MP may also potentially be manipulated, particularly by intracellular pathogens, for survival advantage.	PMC3342294

Tissue factor-bearing exosome secretion from human mechanically stimulated bronchial epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo.	J Allergy Clin Immunol	2012	BACKGROUND: Tissue factor (TF), a primary initiator of blood coagulation, also plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis. TF expression in the airways is associated with asthma, a disease characterized in part by subepithelial angiogenesis. OBJECTIVES: To determine potential sources of TF and the mechanisms of its availability in the lung microenvironment. METHODS: Normal human bronchial epithelial cells grown in air-liquid interface culture were subjected to a compressive stress of 30 cm H(2)O; this is comparable to that generated in the airway epithelium during bronchoconstriction in asthma. Conditioned media and cells were harvested to measure TF mRNA and TF protein. We also tested bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and airway biopsies from asthmatic patients and healthy controls for TF. RESULTS: TF mRNA was upregulated 2.2-fold after 3 hours of stress compared with unstressed cells. Intracellular and secreted TF proteins were enhanced 1.6-fold and more than 50-fold, respectively, compared with those of control cells after the onset of compression. The amount of TF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with asthma was found at mean concentrations that were 5 times greater than those of healthy controls. Immunohistochemical staining of endobronchial biopsies identified epithelial localization of TF with increased expression in asthma. Exosomes isolated from the conditioned media of normal human bronchial epithelial cells and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic subjects by ultracentrifugation contained TF. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro and in vivo studies show that mechanically stressed bronchial epithelial cells are a source of secreted TF and that exosomes are potentially a key carrier of the TF signal.

EMBO Rep	2012	GW182 binds to Argonaute (AGO) proteins and has a central role in miRNA-mediated gene silencing. Using lentiviral shRNA-induced GW182 knockdown in HEK293 cells, this study identifies a new role of GW182 in regulating miRNA stability. Stably knocking down GW182 or its paralogue TNRC6B reduces transfected miRNA-mimic half-lives. Replenishment of GW182 family proteins, as well as one of its domain Δ12, significantly restores the stability of transfected miRNA-mimic. GW182 knockdown reduces miRNA secretion via secretory exosomes. Targeted siRNA screening identifies a 3'-5' exoribonuclease complex responsible for the miRNA degradation only when GW182 is knocked down. Immunoprecipitation further confirms that the presence of GW182 in the RISC complex is critical in protecting Argonaute-bound miRNA.	PMC3512404

Front Oncol	2013	Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common and dismal brain tumors in adults. Further elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of GBM is mandatory to improve the overall survival of patients. A novel small non-coding RNA molecule, microRNA (miRNA), appears to represent one of the most attractive target molecules contributing to the pathogenesis of various types of tumors. Recent global analyses have revealed that several miRNAs are clinically implicated in GBM, with some reports indicating the association of miRNA dysregulation with acquired temozolomide (TMZ) resistance. More recent studies have revealed that miRNAs could play a role in cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, contributing to treatment resistance. In addition, greater impact might be expected from miRNA-targeted therapies based on tumor-derived exosomes that contain numerous functional miRNAs, which could be transferred between tumor cells and surrounding structures. Tumor-derived miRNAs are now considered to be a novel molecular mechanism promoting the progression of GBM. Establishment of miRNA-targeted therapies based on miRNA dysregulation of CSCs could provide effective therapeutic strategies for TMZ-resistant GBM. Recent progress has revealed that miRNAs are not only putative biological markers for diagnosis, but also one of the most promising targets for GBM treatment. Here in, we summarize the translational aspects of miRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of GBM.	PMC3566410

Eur J Immunol	2013	The nonclassical human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) is a tolerogenic molecule that can be released to the circulation by expressing cells. This molecule can form dimers but some other complexed HLA-G forms have been proposed to be present in vivo. Here, we further characterized these other complexed HLA-G forms in vivo. Ascitic and pleural exudates from patients were selected based on positivity for HLA-G by ELISA. Complexed HLA-G was detected in exosomes, which indicates an intracellular origin of these forms. 2D-PAGE analysis of exudates and isolated exosomes showed that these high molecular weight complexes were more heterogeneous than the HLA-G1 expressed by cell cultures. Treatment with deglycosylating enzymes did not change the molecular weight of HLA-G complexes. Immunoblot analysis of exudates and exosomes with an anti-ubiquitin antibody showed that at least some of these structures correspond to ubiquitinated HLA-G. HLA-G ubiquitination could be reproduced in vitro in HLA-G1-transfected cell lines, although with a lower modified/nonmodified protein proportion than in exudates. In summary, we demonstrate new circulating HLA-G forms in vivo that open a new perspective in the study of HLA-G function and analysis.

CD73 expression on extracellular vesicles derived from CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T cells contributes to their regulatory function.	Eur J Immunol	2013	CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells maintain immunological tolerance. In this study, the possibility that Treg cells control immune responses via the production of secreted membrane vesicles, such as exosomes, was investigated. Exosomes are released by many cell types, including T cells, and have regulatory functions. Indeed, TCR activation of both freshly isolated Treg cells and an antigen-specific Treg-cell line resulted in the production of exosomes as defined morphologically by EM and by the presence of tetraspanin molecules LAMP-1/CD63 and CD81. Expression of the ecto-5-nucleotide enzyme CD73 by Treg cells has been shown to contribute to their suppressive function by converting extracellular adenosine-5-monophosphate to adenosine, which, following interaction with adenosine receptors expressed on target cells, leads to immune modulation. CD73 was evident on Treg cell derived exosomes, accordingly when these exosomes were incubated in the presence of adenosine-5-monophosphate production of adenosine was observed. Most importantly, CD73 present on Treg cell derived exosomes was essential for their suppressive function hitherto exosomes derived from a CD73-negative CD4(+) T-cell line did not have such capabilities. Overall our findings demonstrate that CD73-expressing exosomes produced by Treg cells following activation contribute to their suppressive activity through the production of adenosine.

Am J Physiol Renal Physiol	2013	Micro (mi)RNAs are frequently dysregulated in the development of renal fibrosis. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles that could be isolated from urine secreted from all nephron segments. Here we sought to observe for the first time whether miRNA in urine exosome could serve as a potential biomarker of renal fibrosis. Urine samples were collected from 32 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who underwent kidney biopsy and 7 controls. Exosome was isolated and confirmed by immunogold staining of exosome marker. Members of miR-29, miR-200, and RNU6B as endogenous control were detected by RT quantitative PCR. Electronic microscopy verified a typical shape of exosome with average size of 65.1 nm and labeled it with anti-CD9 and anti-aquaporin 2 antibody. Members of miR-29 and miR-200 are readily measured with reduced levels compared with controls (P < 0.05) and can robustly distinguish CKD from controls [area under the curve (AUC) varied from 0.902 to 1 by receiver operating characteristics analysis]. miR-29c correlated with both estimated glomerular filtration rate (r = 0.362; P < 0.05) and degree of tubulointerstitial fibrosis (r = -0.359; P < 0.05) for CKD patients. Moreover, miRNA in exosome was decreased in mild fibrosis group compared with moderated to severe group. miR-29a and miR-29c could predict degree of tubulointerstitial fibrosis with AUC of 0.883 and 0.738 (P < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing mild from moderate to severe fibrosis were 93.8 and 81.3% with the use of miR-29a and 68.8 and 81.3% for miR-29c. Overall, miR-29c in urinary exosome correlates with both renal function and degree of histological fibrosis, suggesting it as a novel, noninvasive marker for renal fibrosis.

Exosome encased spherical nucleic acid gold nanoparticle conjugates as potent microRNA regulation agents.	Small	2014	Exosomes are a class of naturally occurring nanomaterials that play crucial roles in the protection and transport of endogenous macromolecules, such as microRNA and mRNA, over long distances. Intense effort is underway to exploit the use of exosomes to deliver synthetic therapeutics. Herein, transmission electron microscopy is used to show that when spherical nucleic acid (SNA) constructs are endocytosed into PC-3 prostate cancer cells, a small fraction of them (<1%) can be naturally sorted into exosomes. The exosome-encased SNAs are secreted into the extracellular environment from which they can be isolated and selectively re-introduced into the cell type from which they were derived. In the context of anti-miR21 experiments, the exosome-encased SNAs knockdown miR-21 target by approximately 50%. Similar knockdown of miR-21 by free SNAs requires a ≈3000-fold higher concentration.

Hypoxia-induced changes in the bioactivity of cytotrophoblast-derived exosomes.	PLoS One	2013	Migration of extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) into decidua and myometrium is a critical process in the conversion of maternal spiral arterioles and establishing placenta perfusion. EVT migration is affected by cell-to-cell communication and oxygen tension. While the release of exosomes from placental cells has been identified as a significant pathway in materno-fetal communication, the role of placental-derived exosomes in placentation has yet to be established. The aim of this study was to establish the effect of oxygen tension on the release and bioactivity of cytotrophoblast (CT)-derived exosomes on EVT invasion and proliferation. CT were isolated from first trimester fetal tissue (n = 12) using a trypsin-deoxyribonuclease-dispase/Percoll method. CT were cultured under 8%, 3% or 1% O2 for 48 h. Exosomes from CT-conditioned media were isolated by differential and buoyant density centrifugation. The effect of oxygen tension on exosome release (µg exosomal protein/10(6)cells/48 h) and bioactivity were established. HTR-8/SVneo (EVT) were used as target cells to establish the effect (bioactivity) of exosomes on invasion and proliferation as assessed by real-time, live-cell imaging (Incucyte™). The release and bioactivity of CT-derived exosomes were inversely correlated with oxygen tension (p<0.001). Under low oxygen tensions (i.e. 1% O2), CT-derived exosomes promoted EVT invasion and proliferation. Proteomic analysis of exosomes identified oxygen-dependent changes in protein content. We propose that in response to changes in oxygen tension, CTs modify the bioactivity of exosomes, thereby, regulating EVT phenotype. Exosomal induction of EVT migration may represent a normal process of placentation and/or an adaptive response to placental hypoxia.	PMC3823597

Curr Biol	2014	How cells communicate during development and regeneration is a critical question. One mechanism of intercellular communication is via exosomes, extracellular vesicles that originate by the fusion of multivesicular endosomes with the plasma membrane [1-8]. To model exosome-based intercellular communication, we used Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell cysts grown in 3D gels of extracellular matrix, which form tubules in response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We report that GPRC5B, an orphan G protein coupled receptor, is in exosomes produced by HGF-treated cysts and released into the cyst lumen. Exosomal GPRC5B is taken up by nearby cells and together with HGF promotes extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation and tubulogenesis, even under conditions where tubulogenesis would otherwise not occur. Recovery from injury, such as acute kidney injury (AKI), often recapitulates developmental processes. Here, we show that GPRC5B is elevated in urinary exosomes from patients with AKI. Our results elucidate how GPRC5B is carried by exosomes and augments HGF-induced morphogenesis. The unexpected role of exosomes in transporting GPRC5B between cells during morphogenesis and the ability of GPRC5B to predict the disease state of AKI elucidate a novel mechanism for intercellular communication during development and repair.

Dll4-containing exosomes induce capillary sprout retraction in a 3D microenvironment.	Sci Rep	2014	Delta-like 4 (Dll4), a membrane-bound Notch ligand, plays a fundamental role in vascular development and angiogenesis. Dll4 is highly expressed in capillary endothelial tip cells and is involved in suppressing neighboring stalk cells to become tip cells during angiogenesis. Dll4-Notch signaling is mediated either by direct cell-cell contact or by Dll4-containing exosomes from a distance. However, whether Dll4-containing exosomes influence tip cells of existing capillaries is unknown. Using a 3D microfluidic device and time-lapse confocal microscopy, we show here for the first time that Dll4-containing exosomes causes tip cells to lose their filopodia and trigger capillary sprout retraction in collagen matrix. We demonstrate that Dll4 exosomes can freely travel through 3D collagen matrix and transfer Dll4 protein to distant tip cells. Upon reaching endothelial sprout, it causes filopodia and tip cell retraction. Continuous application of Dll4 exosomes from a distance lead to significant reduction of sprout formation. This effect correlates with Notch signaling activation upon Dll4-containing exosome interaction with recipient endothelial cells. Furthermore, we show that Dll4-containing exosomes increase endothelial cell motility while suppressing their proliferation. These data revealed novel functions of Dll4 in angiogenesis through exosomes.	PMC3916896

Cancer Cell	2014	Cancer-secreted microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging mediators of cancer-host crosstalk. Here we show that miR-105, which is characteristically expressed and secreted by metastatic breast cancer cells, is a potent regulator of migration through targeting the tight junction protein ZO-1. In endothelial monolayers, exosome-mediated transfer of cancer-secreted miR-105 efficiently destroys tight junctions and the integrity of these natural barriers against metastasis. Overexpression of miR-105 in nonmetastatic cancer cells induces metastasis and vascular permeability in distant organs, whereas inhibition of miR-105 in highly metastatic tumors alleviates these effects. miR-105 can be detected in the circulation at the premetastatic stage, and its levels in the blood and tumor are associated with ZO-1 expression and metastatic progression in early-stage breast cancer.

Proteomes	2013	Radiation and drug resistance are significant challenges in the treatment of locally advanced, recurrent and metastatic breast cancer that contribute to mortality. Clinically, radiotherapy requires oxygen to generate cytotoxic free radicals that cause DNA damage and allow that damage to become fixed in the genome rather than repaired. However, approximately 40% of all breast cancers have hypoxic tumor microenvironments that render cancer cells significantly more resistant to irradiation. Hypoxic stimuli trigger changes in the cell death/survival pathway that lead to increased cellular radiation resistance. As a result, the development of noninvasive strategies to assess tumor hypoxia in breast cancer has recently received considerable attention. Exosomes are secreted nanovesicles that have roles in paracrine signaling during breast tumor progression, including tumor-stromal interactions, activation of proliferative pathways and immunosuppression. The recent development of protocols to isolate and purify exosomes, as well as advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics have facilitated the comprehensive analysis of exosome content and function. Using these tools, studies have demonstrated that the proteome profiles of tumor-derived exosomes are indicative of the oxygenation status of patient tumors. They have also demonstrated that exosome signaling pathways are potentially targetable drivers of hypoxia-dependent intercellular signaling during tumorigenesis. This article provides an overview of how proteomic tools can be effectively used to characterize exosomes and elucidate fundamental signaling pathways and survival mechanisms underlying hypoxia-mediated radiation resistance in breast cancer.

Electronic address: .	whitesidetl@upmc.edu		Isolation of biologically-active exosomes from human plasma.	J Immunol Methods	2014	Effects of exosomes present in human plasma on immune cells have not been examined in detail. Immunological studies with plasma-derived exosomes require their isolation by procedures involving ultracentrifugation. These procedures were largely developed using supernatants of cultured cells. To test biologic activities of plasma-derived exosomes, methods are necessary that ensure adequate recovery of exosome fractions free of contaminating larger vesicles, cell fragments and protein/nucleic acid aggregates. Here, an optimized method for exosome isolation from human plasma/serum specimens of normal controls (NC) or cancer patients and its advantages and pitfalls are described. To remove undesirable plasma-contaminating components, ultrafiltration of differentially-centrifuged plasma/serum followed by size-exclusion chromatography prior to ultracentrifugation facilitated the removal of contaminants. Plasma or serum was equally acceptable as a source of exosomes based on the recovered protein levels (in μg protein/mL plasma) and TEM image quality. Centrifugation on sucrose density gradients led to large exosome losses. Fresh plasma was the best source of morphologically-intact exosomes, while the use of frozen/thawed plasma decreased exosome purity but not their biologic activity. Treatments of frozen plasma with DNAse, RNAse or hyaluronidase did not improve exosome purity and are not recommended. Cancer patients' plasma consistently yielded more isolated exosomes than did NCs' plasma. Cancer patients' exosomes also mediated higher immune suppression as evidenced by decreased CD69 expression on responder CD4+ T effector cells. Thus, the described procedure yields biologically-active, morphologically-intact exosomes that have reasonably good purity without large protein losses and can be used for immunological, biomarker and other studies.

Methods Mol Biol	2014	Urinary exosomes are nanovesicles (40-100 nm) of endocytic origin that are secreted into the urine when a multivesicular body fuses with the membrane of cells from all nephron segments. Interest in urinary exosomes intensified after the discovery that they contain not only protein and mRNA but also microRNA (miRNA) markers of renal dysfunction and structural injury. Currently, the most widely used protocol for the isolation of urinary exosomes is based on ultracentrifugation, a method that is time consuming, requires expensive equipment, and has low scalability, which limits its applicability in the clinical practice. In this chapter, a simple, fast, and highly scalable step-by-step method for isolation of urinary exosomes is described. This method starts with a 10-min centrifugation of 10 ml urine, then the supernatant is saved (SN1), and the pellet is treated with dithiothreitol and heat to release and recover those exosomes entrapped by polymeric Tamm-Horsfall protein. The treated pellet is then resuspended and centrifuged, and the supernatant obtained (SN2) is combined with the first supernatant, SN1. Next, 3.3 ml of ExoQuick-TC, a commercial exosome precipitation reagent, is added to the total supernatant (SN1 + SN2), mixed well, and saved for at least 12 h at 4 °C. Finally, a pellet of exosomes is obtained after a 30-min centrifugation of the supernatant/ExoQuick-TC mix. We previously compared this method with five others used to isolate urinary exosomes and found that this is the simplest, fastest, and most effective alternative to ultracentrifugation-based protocols if the goal of the study is RNA profiling. A method for isolation and quantification of miRNAs and mRNAs from urinary exosomes is also described here. In addition, we provide a step-by-step description of exosomal miRNA profiling using universal reverse transcription and SYBR qPCR.

In vivo kinetic biodistribution of nano-sized outer membrane vesicles derived from bacteria.	Small	2015	Evaluation of kinetic distribution and behaviors of nanoparticles in vivo provides crucial clues into their roles in living organisms. Extracellular vesicles are evolutionary conserved nanoparticles, known to play important biological functions in intercellular, inter-species, and inter-kingdom communication. In this study, the first kinetic analysis of the biodistribution of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs)-bacterial extracellular vesicles-with immune-modulatory functions is performed. OMVs, injected intraperitoneally, spread to the whole mouse body and accumulate in the liver, lung, spleen, and kidney within 3 h of administration. As an early systemic inflammation response, increased levels of TNF-α and IL-6 are observed in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In addition, the number of leukocytes and platelets in the blood is decreased. OMVs and cytokine concentrations, as well as body temperature are gradually decreased 6 h after OMV injection, in concomitance with the formation of eye exudates, and of an increase in ICAM-1 levels in the lung. Following OMV elimination, most of the inflammatory signs are reverted, 12 h post-injection. However, leukocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are increased as a late reaction. Taken together, these results suggest that OMVs are effective mediators of long distance communication in vivo.

Importance of exosome depletion protocols to eliminate functional and RNA-containing extracellular vesicles from fetal bovine serum.	J Extracell Vesicles	2014	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including the nano-sized exosomes, have the capacity to transfer multiple functional molecules between cells. In cell culture experiments, fetal bovine serum (FBS) is often used to supplement cell culture medium as a nutrient, but it is important to know that the FBS also contain significant quantities of EVs. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the FBS EVs can influence cultured cell phenotype, and secondly to determine the efficiency of FBS-EV elimination protocols. Firstly, FBS that had not been depleted of EVs induced a migratory phenotype in a lung cancer epithelial cell line (A549 cells), an effect that could be mimicked by isolated FBS EVs alone. FBS-derived EVs also contained RNA, which was protected from consecutive proteinase K and RNase A treatment. Comparison of common isolation protocols suggested that an 18-hour centrifugation period eliminates approximately 95% of RNA-containing FBS EVs, whereas a 1.5-hour protocol is insufficient. In conclusion, this study shows that FBS EVs substantially influence cultured cell behaviour, but also that they can be virtually removed by an 18-hour ultracentrifugation protocol.	PMC4185091

Vps4A functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating the secretion and uptake of exosomal microRNAs in human hepatoma cells.	Hepatology	2015	The deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays an important role in human hepatocarcinogenesis. In this study, we highlight exosomes as mediators involved in modulating miRNA profiles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. First, we examined the different miRNA expression profiles in HCC cells and HCC cell-derived exosomes. Next, coculture experiments indicated that HCC cell-derived exosomes promoted the cell growth, migration, and invasion of HCC cells and had the ability to shuttle miRNAs to recipient cells. Further, our data showed that Vps4A, a key regulator of exosome biogenesis, was frequently down-regulated in HCC tissues. The reduction of Vps4A in HCC tissues was associated with tumor progression and metastasis. In vitro studies revealed that Vps4A repressed the growth, colony formation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. We further investigated the role and involvement of Vps4A in suppressing the bioactivity of exosomes and characterized its ability to weaken the cell response to exosomes. By small RNA sequencing, we demonstrated that Vps4A facilitated the secretion of oncogenic miRNAs in exosomes as well as accumulation and uptake of tumor suppressor miRNAs in cells. A subset of Vps4A-associated miRNAs was identified. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated that the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway was the most likely candidate pathway for modulation by these miRNAs. Indeed, we proved that the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway was inactivated by Vps4A overexpression. CONCLUSION: Exosome-mediated miRNA transfer is an important mechanism of self-modulation of the miRNA expression profiles in HCC cells, and Vps4A may function as a tumor suppressor, which utilizes exosomes as mediators to regulate the secretion and uptake of miRNAs in hepatoma cells; these observations provide new insights into the development of HCC.

Diabetic nephropathy is associated with increased urine excretion of proteases plasmin, prostasin and urokinase and activation of amiloride-sensitive current in collecting duct cells.	Nephrol Dial Transplant	2015	BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is associated with hypertension, expanded extracellular volume and impaired renal Na(+) excretion. It was hypothesized that aberrant glomerular filtration of serine proteases in DN causes proteolytic activation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the kidney by excision of an inhibitory peptide tract from the γ subunit. METHODS: In a cross-sectional design, urine, plasma and clinical data were collected from type 1 diabetic patients with DN (n = 19) and matched normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetics (controls, n = 20). Urine was examined for proteases by western immunoblotting, patch clamp and ELISA. Urine exosomes were isolated to elucidate potential cleavage of γENaC by a monoclonal antibody directed against the 'inhibitory' peptide tract. RESULTS: Compared with control, DN patients displayed significantly higher blood pressure and urinary excretion of plasmin(ogen), prostasin and urokinase that correlated directly with urine albumin. Western blotting confirmed plasmin, prostasin and urokinase in urine from the DN group predominantly. Urine from DN evoked a significantly larger amiloride-sensitive inward current in single collecting duct cells compared with controls. Immunoblotting of urine exosomes showed aquaporin 2 in all patient samples. Exosomes displayed a virtual absence of intact γENaC while moieties compatible with cleavage by furin only, were shown in both groups. Proteolytic cleavage by the extracellular serine proteases plasmin or prostasin was observed in DN samples predominantly. CONCLUSION: DN is associated with increased urinary excretion of plasmin, prostasin and urokinase and proteolytic activation of ENaC that might contribute to impaired renal Na(+) excretion and hypertension.

Methods Mol Biol	2015	Exosomes are 40-150 nm extracellular vesicles that are released from a multitude of cell types, and perform diverse cellular functions including intercellular communication, antigen presentation, and transfer of tumorigenic proteins, mRNA and miRNA. Exosomes are important regulators of the cellular niche, and their altered characteristics in many diseases, such as cancer, suggest their importance for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, and as drug delivery vehicles. Exosomes have been purified from biological fluids and in vitro cell cultures using a variety of strategies and techniques. In this chapter, we reveal the protocol and key insights into the isolation, purification and characterization of exosomes, distinct from shed microvesicles and apoptotic blebs. Using the colorectal cancer cell line LIM1863 as a cell model, a comprehensive evaluation of exosome isolation methods including ultracentrifugation (UC-Exos), OptiPrep™ density-based separation (DG-Exos), and immunoaffinity capture using anti-EpCAM-coated magnetic beads (IAC-Exos) were examined. All exosome isolation methodologies contained 40-150 nm vesicles based on electron microscopy, and positive for exosome markers (Alix, TSG101, HSP70) based on immunoblotting. This protocol employed a proteomic profiling approach to characterize the protein composition of exosomes, and label-free spectral counting to evaluate the effectiveness of each method in exosome isolation. Based on the number of MS/MS spectra identified for exosome markers and proteins associated with their biogenesis, trafficking, and release, IAC-Exos was shown to be the most effective method to isolate exosomes. However, the use of density-based separation (DG-Exos) provides significant advantages for exosome isolation when the use of immunoaffinity capture is limited (due to antibody availability and suitability of exosome markers).

Fibroblast-Derived Exosomes Contribute to Chemoresistance through Priming Cancer Stem Cells in Colorectal Cancer.	PLoS One	2015	Chemotherapy resistance observed in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) may be related to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), but the underlying mechanism(s) remain unclear. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are intimately involved in tumor recurrence, and targeting them increases chemo-sensitivity. We investigated whether fibroblasts might increase CSCs thus mediating chemotherapy resistance. CSCs were isolated from either patient-derived xenografts or CRC cell lines based on expression of CD133. First, CSCs were found to be inherently resistant to cell death induced by chemotherapy. In addition, fibroblast-derived conditioned medium (CM) promoted percentage, clonogenicity and tumor growth of CSCs (i.e., CD133+ and TOP-GFP+) upon treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) or oxaliplatin (OXA). Further investigations exhibited that exosomes, isolated from CM, similarly took the above effects. Inhibition of exosome secretion decreased the percentage, clonogenicity and tumor growth of CSCs. Altogether, our findings suggest that, besides targeting CSCs, new therapeutic strategies blocking CAFs secretion even before chemotherapy shall be developed to gain better clinical benefits in advanced CRCs.

Carcinogenesis	2015	Exosomes are increasingly recognized as important mediators of cell-cell communication in cancer progression through the horizontal transfer of RNAs and proteins to neighboring or distant cells. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant cancer, whose metastasis is largely influenced by the tumor microenvironment. The possible role of exosomes in the interactions between HCC tumor cell and its surrounding hepatic milieu are however largely unknown. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the exosomal RNA and proteome contents derived from three HCC cell lines (HKCI-C3, HKCI-8 and MHCC97L) and an immortalized hepatocyte line (MIHA) using Ion Torrent sequencing and mass spectrometry, respectively. RNA deep sequencing and proteomic analysis revealed exosomes derived from metastatic HCC cell lines carried a large number of protumorigenic RNAs and proteins, such as MET protooncogene, S100 family members and the caveolins. Of interest, we found that exosomes from motile HCC cell lines could significantly enhance the migratory and invasive abilities of non-motile MIHA cell. We further demonstrated that uptake of these shuttled molecules could trigger PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways in MIHA with increased secretion of active MMP-2 and MMP-9. Our study showed for the first time that HCC-derived exosomes could mobilize normal hepatocyte, which may have implication in facilitating the protrusive activity of HCC cells through liver parenchyma during the process of metastasis.

Extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer of functional RNA in the tumor microenvironment.	Oncoimmunology	2015	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to transfer various molecules, including functional RNA between cells and this process has been suggested to be particularly relevant in tumor-host interactions. However, data on EV-mediated RNA transfer has been obtained primarily by in vitro experiments or involving ex vivo manipulations likely affecting its biology, leaving their physiological relevance unclear. We engineered glioma and carcinoma tumor cells to express Cre recombinase showing their release of EVs containing Cre mRNA in various EV subfractions including exosomes. Transplantation of these genetically modified tumor cells into mice with a Cre reporter background leads to frequent recombination events at the tumor site. In both tumor models the majority of recombined cells are CD45+ leukocytes, predominantly Gr1+CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). In addition, multiple lineages of recombined cells can be observed in the glioma model. In the lung carcinoma model, recombined MDSCs display an enhanced immunosuppressive phenotype and an altered miRNA profile compared to their non-recombined counterparts. Cre-lox based tracing of tumor EV RNA transfer in vivo can therefore be used to identify individual target cells in the tumor microenvironment for further mechanistical or functional analysis.

J Transl Med	2015	BACKGROUND: It has been well documented that alcohol and its metabolites induce injury and inflammation in the liver. However, there is no potential biomarker to monitor the extent of liver injury in alcoholic hepatitis patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that are involved in various physiologic and pathologic processes. In the circulation, a great proportion of miRNAs is associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs)/exosomes. Here, we hypothesized that the exosome-associated miRNAs can be used as potential biomarkers in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from sera of alcohol-fed mice or pair-fed mice, and plasma of alcoholic hepatitis patients or healthy controls by ExoQuick. The exosomes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and Western blot and enumerated with a Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis system. Firefly™ microRNA Assay was performed on miRNA extracted from mice sera. TaqMan microRNA assay was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in plasma of cohort of patients with AH versus controls followed by construction of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the candidates. RESULTS: The total number of circulating EVs was significantly increased in mice after alcohol feeding. Those EVs mainly consisted of exosomes, the smaller size vesicle subpopulation of EVs. By performing microarray screening on exosomes, we found nine inflammatory miRNAs which were deregulated in sera of chronic alcohol-fed mice compared to controls including upregulated miRNAs: miRNA-192, miRNA-122, miRNA-30a, miRNA-744, miRNA-1246, miRNA 30b and miRNA-130a. The ROC analyses indicated excellent diagnostic value of miRNA-192, miRNA-122, and miRNA-30a to identify alcohol-induced liver injury. We further validated findings from our animal model in human samples. Consistent with the animal model, total number of EVs, mostly exosomes, was significantly increased in human subjects with AH. Both miRNA-192 and miRNA-30a were significantly increased in the circulation of subjects with AH. miRNA-192 showed promising value for the diagnosis of AH. CONCLUSION: Elevated level of EVs/exosomes and exosome-associated miRNA signature could serve as potential diagnostic markers for AH. In addition to the biomarker diagnostic capabilities, these findings may facilitate development of novel strategies for diagnostics, monitoring, and therapeutics of AH.	PMC4533956

J Neurovirol	2016	In the era of combined antiretroviral therapy (CART), many of the complications due to HIV-1 infection have diminished. One exception is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). HAND is a spectrum of disorders in cognitive function that ranges from asymptomatic disease to severe dementia (HAD). The milder form of HAND has actually remained the same or slightly increased in prevalence in the CART era. Even in individuals who have maintained undetectable HIV RNA loads, viral proteins such as Nef and Tat can continue to be expressed. In this report, we show that Nef protein and nef messenger RNA (mRNA) are packaged into exosomes that remain in circulation in patients with HAD. Plasma-derived Nef exosomes from patients with HAD have the ability to interact with the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and deliver nef mRNA. The mRNA can induce expression of Nef in target cells and subsequently increase expression and secretion of beta-amyloid (Aβ) and Aβ peptides. Increase secretion of amyloid peptide could contribute to cognitive impairment seen in HAND.	PMC4783240

J Biol Chem	2016	Membrane-coated extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by cells can serve as vehicles for delivery of biological materials and signals. Recently, we demonstrated that alcohol-treated hepatocytes cross-talk with immune cells via exosomes containing microRNA (miRNAs). Here, we hypothesized that alcohol-exposed monocytes can communicate with naive monocytes via EVs. We observed increased numbers of EVs, mostly exosomes, secreted by primary human monocytes and THP-1 monocytic cells in the presence of alcohol in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. EVs derived from alcohol-treated monocytes stimulated naive monocytes to polarize into M2 macrophages as indicated by increased surface expression of CD68 (macrophage marker), M2 markers (CD206 (mannose receptor) and CD163 (scavenger receptor)), secretion of IL-10, and TGFβ and increased phagocytic activity. miRNA profiling of the EVs derived from alcohol-treated THP-1 monocytes revealed high expression of the M2-polarizing miRNA, miR-27a. Treatment of naive monocytes with control EVs overexpressing miR-27a reproduced the effect of EVs from alcohol-treated monocytes on naive monocytes and induced M2 polarization, suggesting that the effect of alcohol EVs was mediated by miR-27a. We found that miR-27a modulated the process of phagocytosis by targeting CD206 expression on monocytes. Importantly, analysis of circulating EVs from plasma of alcoholic hepatitis patients revealed increased numbers of EVs that contained high levels of miR-27a as compared with healthy controls. Our results demonstrate the following: first, alcohol increases EV production in monocytes; second, alcohol-exposed monocytes communicate with naive monocytes via EVs; and third, miR-27a cargo in monocyte-derived EVs can program naive monocytes to polarize into M2 macrophages.

Thromb Res	2016	INTRODUCTION: Microvesicles including exosomes and microparticles, participate in the placental-maternal crosstalk in normal pregnancies and gestational vascular complications (GVC). Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is known to reduce the risk of placenta-mediated pregnancy complications. This study was aimed to characterize microvesicles of pregnant women receiving LMWH and explore microvesicle involvement in trophoblast and endothelial cell function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microvesicles were isolated from blood samples obtained from non-pregnant women, healthy pregnant women (HP) and pregnant woman treated with LMWH. Microvesicle protein contents were assessed by protein array and ELISA. Microvesicle effects on early stage trophoblasts, term trophoblasts and endothelial cell migration, angiogenesis and apoptosis were evaluated. RESULTS: Microvesicles derived from the group treated with LMWH contained higher levels of several proangiogenic proteins compared to those of HP women. Exposure of endothelial cells to circulating microvesicles derived from HP and LMWH treated groups induced significantly higher cell migration and branch tube formation compared to untreated cells. The effect of microvesicles from HP- and LMWH groups on early-stage trophoblast migration was similar. Microvesicles derived from these two study groups significantly decreased early-stage trophoblast apoptosis, while microvesicles derived from the HP-group (but not from the LMWH-group) significantly increased the term trophoblast apoptosis (TUNEL assay) compared to untreated cells. CONCLUSION: Therapy with LMWH affects patients' microvesicle content, leading to normalization of invasion, angiogenesis activity and survival of endothelial and trophoblast cells in vitro. The effects of LMWH on microvesicles may point to an additional mechanism of heparin action in high-risk pregnancy.

Electronic address: .	lmao@umaryland.edu		Triple SILAC quantitative proteomic analysis reveals differential abundance of cell signaling proteins between normal and lung cancer-derived exosomes.	J Proteomics	2016	Exosomes are 30-100 nm sized membrane vesicles released by cells into the extracellular space that mediate intercellular communication via transfer of proteins and other biological molecules. To better understand the role of these microvesicles in lung carcinogenesis, we employed a Triple SILAC quantitative proteomic strategy to examine the differential protein abundance between exosomes derived from an immortalized normal bronchial epithelial cell line and two non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines harboring distinct activating mutations in the cell signaling molecules: Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In total, we were able to quantify 721 exosomal proteins derived from the three cell lines. Proteins associated with signal transduction, including EGFR, GRB2 and SRC, were enriched in NSCLC exosomes, and could actively regulate cell proliferation in recipient cells. This study's investigation of the NSCLC exosomal proteome has identified enriched protein cargo that can contribute to lung cancer progression, which may have potential clinical implications in biomarker development for patients with NSCLC. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The high mortality associated with lung cancer is a result of late-stage diagnosis of the disease. Current screening techniques used for early detection of lung cancer lack the specificity for accurate diagnosis. Exosomes are nano-sized extracellular vesicles, and the increased abundance of select protein cargo in exosomes derived from cancer cells may be used for diagnostic purposes. In this paper, we applied quantitative proteomic analysis to elucidate abundance differences in exosomal protein cargo between two NSCLC cell lines with distinctive oncogene mutations and an immortalized normal bronchial epithelial cell line. This study revealed proteins associated with cell adhesion, the extracellular matrix, and a variety of signaling molecules were enriched in NSCLC exosomes. The present data reveals a protein profile associated with NSCLC exosomes that suggests a role these vesicles have in the progression of lung carcinogenesis, as well as identifies several promising candidates that could be utilized as a multi-marker protein panel in a diagnostic platform for NSCLC.

Virus Genes	2016	Exosomes are small secreted cellular vesicles for intercellular communications which contain proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs). Recent studies have shown that exosomes play an important role in the transmission of infectious agents including hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and so on. However, the role of exosomes in the transfer of enterovirus 71 (EV71) between host cells remains unknown. In this study, we show that the exosomes derived from EV71-infected rhabdomyosarcoma cells contain EV71 RNA and capsid protein VP1, determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (QRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. The shedding of exosomes containing virus can establish a productive infection in human neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH). A comparative analysis of neutralization by EV71-specific immunoglobulins showed different levels of neutralization of exosomes-mediated infection compared with free virus. In conclusion, exosomes from EV71-infected cells may play an important role in virus dissemination and are partially resisted to antibody neutralization. Our results suggest that there is an exosomal route of EV71 transmission infection.

Engineering hybrid exosomes by membrane fusion with liposomes.	Sci Rep	2016	Exosomes are a valuable biomaterial for the development of novel nanocarriers as functionally advanced drug delivery systems. To control and modify the performance of exosomal nanocarriers, we developed hybrid exosomes by fusing their membranes with liposomes using the freeze-thaw method. Exosomes embedded with a specific membrane protein isolated from genetically modified cells were fused with various liposomes, confirming that membrane engineering methods can be combined with genetic modification techniques. Cellular uptake studies performed using the hybrid exosomes revealed that the interactions between the developed exosomes and cells could be modified by changing the lipid composition or the properties of the exogenous lipids. These results suggest that the membrane-engineering approach reported here offers a new strategy for developing rationally designed exosomes as hybrid nanocarriers for use in advanced drug delivery systems.

Biol Open	2016	The interaction between glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) and glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) is an essential aspect of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Therefore, understanding how GECs communicate with GMCs in the diabetic environment is crucial for the development of new targets for the prevention and treatment of DN. Exosomes, nanometer-sized extracellular membrane vesicles secreted by various cell types, play important roles in cell-to-cell communication via the transfer of mRNA, microRNA and protein. In this study, we demonstrate that high glucose (HG)-treated GECs secrete a higher number of exosomes highly enriched in TGF-β1 mRNA compared with normal glucose (NG)-treated GECs. Exosomes released by HG-treated GECs can promote α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, proliferation and extracellular matrix protein overproduction in GMCs through the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway. Thus, we provide new insights into the pathogenesis of DN that involves intercellular transfer of TGF-β1 mRNA in the GEC-to-GMC direction via exosomes.	PMC4890664

J Cell Biol	2016	Exosomes are nanovesicles released by virtually all cells, which act as intercellular messengers by transfer of protein, lipid, and RNA cargo. Their quantitative efficiency, routes of cell uptake, and subcellular fate within recipient cells remain elusive. We quantitatively characterize exosome cell uptake, which saturates with dose and time and reaches near 100% transduction efficiency at picomolar concentrations. Highly reminiscent of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, exosomes are recruited as single vesicles to the cell body by surfing on filopodia as well as filopodia grabbing and pulling motions to reach endocytic hot spots at the filopodial base. After internalization, exosomes shuttle within endocytic vesicles to scan the endoplasmic reticulum before being sorted into the lysosome as their final intracellular destination. Our data quantify and explain the efficiency of exosome internalization by recipient cells, establish a new parallel between exosome and virus host cell interaction, and suggest unanticipated routes of subcellular cargo delivery.

J Neurovirol	2016	HIV-1 Tat is an indispensible transactivator for HIV gene transcription and replication. It has been shown to exit cells as a free protein and enter neighboring cells or interact with surface receptors of neighboring cells to regulate gene expression and cell function. In this study, we report, for the first time, exosome-associated Tat release and uptake. Using a HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase reporter-based cell assay and Western blotting or in combination with exosome inhibitor, OptiPrep gradient fractionation, and exosome depletion, we demonstrated significant presence of HIV-1 Tat in exosomes derived from Tat-expressing primary astrocytes, Tat-transfected U373.MG and 293T, and HIV-infected MT4. We further showed that exosome-associated Tat from Tat-expressing astrocytes was capable of causing neurite shortening and neuron death, further supporting that this new form of extracellular Tat is biologically active. Lastly, we constructed a Tat mutant deleted of its basic domain and determined the role of the basic domain in Tat trafficking into exosomes. Basic domain-deleted Tat exhibited no apparent effects on Tat trafficking into exosomes, while maintained its dominant-negative function in Tat-mediated LTR transactivation. Taken together, these results show a significant fraction of Tat is secreted and present in the form of exosomes and may contribute to the stability of extracellular Tat and broaden the spectrum of its target cells.

Vet Parasitol	2016	Avian coccidiosis is caused by Eimeria, a unicellular, apicomplexan protist which primarily infects intestinal epithelia resulting in nutrient malabsorption and reduced growth of commercial poultry. Vaccination of chickens with exosomes isolated from antigen presenting cells containing parasite antigens (Ags) represents a promising alternative strategy to control avian coccidiosis, but is restricted in its commercial application due to limitations on production scale-up for mass immunization programs. Here, we report the biochemical and physiologic characteristics of exosomes derived from serum of Eimeria tenella-infected chickens and their feasibility for inducing protective immunity to experimental coccidiosis. Exosomes isolated from the serum of E. tenella-infected chickens contained a subset of protein Ags found in the intact parasite. Serum-derived exosomes containing these E. tenella Ags localized to the intestine and spleen following intramuscular injection into naïve chickens. In vitro ELISPOT assays revealed increased numbers of IL-2-, IL-4-, IL-6-, and IFN-γ-secreting cells in the intestine and spleen of exosome-administered chickens, compared with vehicle controls. Pre-immunization of chickens with serum exosomes from E. tenella-infected chickens increased both body weight gain and feed conversion efficiency, and reduced both fecal parasite shedding and gut lesion scores following parasite infection, compared with vehicle controls. Finally, immunization with CD80(+) serum exosomes stimulated greater numbers of cytokine-producing cells, and higher levels of protective immunity to E. tenella infection, compared with CD80(-) exosomes. These results suggest the possibility of producing an effective, parasite-free vaccine against avian coccidiosis under field conditions using serum-derived CD80(+) exosomes containing parasite Ags.

Induction of IFNT-Stimulated Genes by Conceptus-Derived Exosomes during the Attachment Period.	PLoS One	2016	Biochemical and/or physical communication between the conceptus and the uterine endometrium is required for conceptus implantation to the maternal endometrium, leading to placentation and the establishment of pregnancy. We previously reported that in vitro co-culture system with bovine trophoblast CT-1 cells, primary uterine endometrial epithelial cells (EECs), and uterine flushings (UFs) mimics in vivo conceptus attachment process. To identify molecules in UFs responsible for this change, we first characterized protein contents of UFs from day 17 cyclic (C17) and pregnant (P17) ewes through the use of two dimensional-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), followed by Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. These analyses identified 266 proteins specific for P17 UFs, from which 172 proteins were identified as exosomal proteins. Among 172 exosomal proteins, 8 proteins that had been identified as exosomal proteins were chosen for further analysis, including macrophage-capping protein (CAPG), aldo-keto reductase family 1, member B1 protein (AKR1B1), bcl-2-like protein 15 (BCL2L15), carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2), isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (EEF2), moesin (MSN), and ezrin (EZR). CAPG and AKR1B1 were again confirmed in P15 and P17 UFs, and more importantly CAPG and AKR1B1, mRNA and protein, were found only in P15 and P17 conceptuses. Moreover, exosomes were isolated from C15, C17, P15, or P17 UFs. Only P15 and P17 exosomes, originated from the conceptus, contained interferon tau (IFNT) as well as CAPG and AKR1B1, and up-regulated STAT1, STAT2, MX1, MX2, BST2, and ISG15 transcripts in EECs. These observations indicate that in addition to endometrial derived exosomes previously described, conceptus-derived exosomes are present in UFs and could function to modify endometrial response. These results suggest that exosomes secreted from conceptuses as well as endometria are involved in cell to cell interactions for conceptus implantation to the maternal endometrium.	PMC4924817

Exosome engineering for efficient intracellular delivery of soluble proteins using optically reversible protein-protein interaction module.	Nat Commun	2016	Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of functional macromolecules is a promising method for treating a variety of human diseases. Among nanoparticles, cell-derived exosomes have recently been highlighted as a new therapeutic strategy for the in vivo delivery of nucleotides and chemical drugs. Here we describe a new tool for intracellular delivery of target proteins, named 'exosomes for protein loading via optically reversible protein-protein interactions' (EXPLORs). By integrating a reversible protein-protein interaction module controlled by blue light with the endogenous process of exosome biogenesis, we are able to successfully load cargo proteins into newly generated exosomes. Treatment with protein-loaded EXPLORs is shown to significantly increase intracellular levels of cargo proteins and their function in recipient cells in vitro and in vivo. These results clearly indicate the potential of EXPLORs as a mechanism for the efficient intracellular transfer of protein-based therapeutics into recipient cells and tissues.	PMC4961865

Isolation and characterization of vesicular and non-vesicular microRNAs circulating in sera of partially hepatectomized rats.	Sci Rep	2016	Circulating microRNAs are protected from degradation by their association with either vesicles or components of the RNAi machinery. Although increasing evidence indicates that cell-free microRNAs are transported in body fluids by different types of vesicles, current research mainly focuses on the characterization of exosome-associated microRNAs. However, as isolation and characterization of exosomes is challenging, it is yet unclear whether exosomes or other vesicular elements circulating in serum are the most reliable source for discovering disease-associated biomarkers. In this study, circulating microRNAs associated to the vesicular and non-vesicular fraction of sera isolated from partially hepatectomized rats were measured. Here we show that independently from their origin, levels of miR-122, miR-192, miR-194 and Let-7a are up-regulated two days after partial hepatectomy. The inflammation-associated miR-150 and miR-155 are up-regulated in the vesicular-fraction only, while the regeneration-associated miR-21 and miR-33 are up-regulated in the vesicular- and down-regulated in the non-vesicular fraction. Our study shows for the first time the modulation of non-vesicular microRNAs in animals recovering from partial hepatectomy, suggesting that, in the search for novel disease-associated biomarkers, the profiling of either vesicular or non-vesicular microRNAs may be more relevant than the analysis of microRNAs isolated from unfractionated serum.

Moreover, extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HBV-infected hepatocytes contained viral nucleic acids and induced NKG2D ligand expression in macrophages by stimulating MyD88, TICAM-1, and MAVS-dependent pathways. In addition, depletion of exosomes from EVs markedly reduced NKG2D ligand expression, suggesting the importance of exosomes for NK cell activation. In contrast, infection of hepatocytes with HBV increased immunoregulatory microRNA levels in EVs and exosomes, which were transferred to macrophages, thereby suppressing IL-12p35 mRNA expression in macrophages to counteract the host innate immune response. IFN-γ increased the hepatic expression of DDX60 and augmented the DDX60-dependent degradation of cytoplasmic HBV RNA. Our results elucidated the crucial role of exosomes in antiviral innate immune response against HBV. ACCESSION NUMBER: Accession number of RNA-seq data is DRA004164 (DRA in DDBJ).	PMC5005343

Exosomes derived from MSCs ameliorate retinal laser injury partially by inhibition of MCP-1.	Sci Rep	2016	Although accumulated evidence supports the notion that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) act in a paracrine manner, the mechanisms are still not fully understood. Recently, MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos), a type of microvesicle released from MSCs, were thought to carry functional proteins and RNAs to recipient cells and play therapeutic roles. In the present study, we intravitreally injected MSCs derived from either mouse adipose tissue or human umbilical cord, and their exosomes to observe and compare their functions in a mouse model of laser-induced retinal injury. We found that both MSCs and their exosomes reduced damage, inhibited apoptosis, and suppressed inflammatory responses to obtain better visual function to nearly the same extent in vivo. Obvious down-regulation of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 in the retina was found after MSC-Exos injection. In vitro, MSC-Exos also down-regulated MCP-1 mRNA expression in primarily cultured retinal cells after thermal injury. It was further demonstrated that intravitreal injection of an MCP-1-neutralizing antibody promoted the recovery of retinal laser injury, whereas the therapeutic effect of exosomes was abolished when MSC-Exos and MCP-1 were administrated simultaneously. Collectively, these results suggest that MSC-Exos ameliorate laser-induced retinal injury partially through down-regulation of MCP-1.	PMC5043341

Sci Rep	2016	The aim of the present study was to develop a LC-MS/MS-based proteomic analysis method of urinary exosomal proteins that has the potential to discover disease biomarkers. In short, urinary exosomes from healthy subjects were isolated by immunocapture on magnetic beads, detected by immunofluorescence and TEM, trypsin digested directly on the beads for an accelerated time with no addition of detergents before performing an LC-MS analysis of the trypsinate. To our knowledge, this is the first proteomic analysis of proteins displayed on the outer surface of exosomes. The outer exosome proteome may contain proteins that are of higher biomarker value compared to soluble cargo protein as the proteins projecting into the extracellular milieu might be more directly involved in physiological functions of exosomes. The proteomic analysis identified 49 proteins that were considered significant; the majority is involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism or in immune responses. Thirty of the proteins are linked to diseases. The developed proteomic method exploiting urinary exosomes might be of great value in search for diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers of especially metabolic and immune-related diseases.	PMC5090863

Feto-Maternal Trafficking of Exosomes in Murine Pregnancy Models.	Front Pharmacol	2016	Timing and initiation of labor are well-orchestrated by signals communicated between the fetal and maternal compartments; however, how these signals are communicated is not completely understood. Fetal exosomes, intercellular signaling vesicles, may play a key role in the process. The objective of this study was to evaluate exosome trafficking in vivo from fetal to maternal compartments. Pregnant CD-1 mice were intra-amniotically injected on gestational day 16 and 17 with exosomes isolated from primary human amnion epithelial cells fluorescently labeled with the lipophilic dye 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR). All our analyses were performed on samples collected on Day 18. After 24 h, mice were imaged using Bruker MS FX PRO In vivo Imager and tissues were collected. In vivo imaging of mouse showed fluorescence in the uterus, on the exosome-injected side whereas the uterine tissues from the uninjected side and saline and dye alone injected animals remained negative. Histological analysis of placenta showed exosome migration from the fetal to the maternal side of the placenta. Fluorescence released from exosomes was seen in maternal blood samples as well as in maternal uterus and kidneys. This study demonstrates that exosomal cargo can be carried through systemic route from the fetal to the maternal side of the uterine tissues during pregnancy, supporting the idea that fetal signals can be delivered via exosomes.

Exosomal and Non-Exosomal Urinary miRNAs in Prostate Cancer Detection and Prognosis.	Prostate	2017	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs, involved in post-transcriptional regulation of many target genes. METHODS: Five miRNAs that have been consistently found deregulated in PCa (miR-21, miR-141, miR-214, miR-375, and let-7c) were analyzed in urinary pellets from 60 prostate cancer (PCa) patients and 10 healthy subjects by qRT-PCR. Besides, urinary exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation and analyzed for those miRNAs. RESULTS: Significant upregulation of miR-21, miR-141, and miR-375 was found comparing PCa patients with healthy subjects in urinary pellets, while miR-214 was found significantly downregulated. Regarding urinary exosomes, miR-21 and miR-375 were also significantly upregulated in PCa but no differences were found for miR-141. Significant differences were found for let-7c in PCa in urinary exosomes while no differences were observed in urinary pellets. A panel combining miR-21 and miR-375 is suggested as the best combination to distinguish PCa patients and healthy subjects, with an AUC of 0.872. Furthermore, the association of miRNAs with clinicopathological characteristics was investigated. MiR-141 resulted significantly correlated with Gleason score in urinary pellets and let-7c with clinical stage in urinary exosomes. Additionally, miR-21, miR-141, and miR-214 were found significantly deregulated in intermediate/high-risk PCa versus low-risk/healthy subjects in urinary pellets. Significant differences between both groups were found in urinary exosomes for miR-21, miR-375, and let-7c. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the analysis of miRNAs-especially miRNA-21 and miR-375- in urine could be useful as biomarkers in PCa.

Electronic address: .	cmaguire@mgh.harvard.edu		Rescue of Hearing by Gene Delivery to Inner-Ear Hair Cells Using Exosome-Associated AAV.	Mol Ther	2017	Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a safe and effective vector for gene therapy for retinal disorders. Gene therapy for hearing disorders is not as advanced, in part because gene delivery to sensory hair cells of the inner ear is inefficient. Although AAV transduces the inner hair cells of the mouse cochlea, outer hair cells remain refractory to transduction. Here, we demonstrate that a vector, exosome-associated AAV (exo-AAV), is a potent carrier of transgenes to all inner ear hair cells. Exo-AAV1-GFP is more efficient than conventional AAV1-GFP, both in mouse cochlear explants in vitro and with direct cochlear injection in vivo. Exo-AAV shows no toxicity in vivo, as assayed by tests of auditory and vestibular function. Finally, exo-AAV1 gene therapy partially rescues hearing in a mouse model of hereditary deafness (lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5/tetraspan membrane protein of hair cell stereocilia [Lhfpl5/Tmhs-/-]). Exo-AAV is a powerful gene delivery system for hair cell research and may be useful for gene therapy for deafness.	PMC5368844

High levels of the AR-V7 Splice Variant and Co-Amplification of the Golgi Protein Coding YIPF6 in AR Amplified Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases.	Prostate	2017	BACKGROUND: The relation between androgen receptor (AR) gene amplification and other mechanisms behind castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), such as expression of constitutively active AR variants and steroid-converting enzymes has been poorly examined. Specific aim was to examine AR amplification in PC bone metastases and to explore molecular and functional consequences of this, with the long-term goal of identifying novel molecular targets for treatment. METHODS: Gene amplification was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization in cryo-sections of clinical PC bone metastases (n = 40) and by PCR-based copy number variation analysis. Whole genome mRNA expression was analyzed using H12 Illumina Beadchip arrays and specific transcript levels were quantified by qRT-PCR. Protein localization was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. The YIPF6 mRNA expression was transiently knocked down and stably overexpressed in the 22Rv1 cell line as representative for CRPC, and effects on cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion were determined in vitro. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from cell cultures using size-exclusion chromatography and enumerated by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Protein content was identified by LC-MS/MS analysis. Blood coagulation was measured as activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Functional enrichment analysis was performed using the MetaCore software. RESULTS: AR amplification was detected in 16 (53%) of the bone metastases examined from CRPC patients (n = 30), and in none from the untreated patients (n = 10). Metastases with AR amplification showed high AR and AR-V7 mRNA levels, increased nuclear AR immunostaining, and co-amplification of genes such as YIPF6 in the AR proximity at Xq12. The YIPF6 protein was localized to the Golgi apparatus. YIPF6 overexpression in 22Rv1 cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation and colony formation, and in enhanced EV secretion. EVs from YIPF6 overproducing 22Rv1 cells were enriched for proteins involved in blood coagulation and, accordingly, decreased the APTT in a dose-dependent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: AR amplified CRPC bone metastases show high AR-V7 expression that probably gives resistance to AR-targeting drugs. Co-amplification of the Golgi protein coding YIPF6 gene with the AR may enhance the secretion of pro-coagulative EVs from cancer cells and thereby stimulate tumor progression and increase the coagulopathy risk in CRPC patients.

Mol Cell Proteomics	2017	Parts of Southeast Asia have the highest incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the world because of infection by the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini (Ov). Ov-associated CCA is the culmination of chronic Ov-infection, with the persistent production of the growth factors and cytokines associated with persistent inflammation, which can endure for years in Ov-infected individuals prior to transitioning to CCA. Isobaric labeling and tandem mass spectrometry of liver tissue from a hamster model of CCA was used to compare protein expression profiles from inflammed tissue (Ovinfected but not cancerous) versus cancerous tissue (Ov-induced CCA). Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were used to verify dysregulated proteins in the animal model and in human tissue. We identified 154 dysregulated proteins that marked the transition from Ov-infection to Ov-induced CCA, i.e. proteins dysregulated during carcinogenesis but not Ov-infection. The verification of dysregulated proteins in resected liver tissue from humans with Ov-associated CCA showed the numerous parallels in protein dysregulation between human and animal models of Ov-induced CCA. To identify potential circulating markers for CCA, dysregulated proteins were compared with proteins isolated from exosomes secreted by a human CCA cell line (KKU055) and 27 proteins were identified as dysregulated in CCA and present in exosomes. These data form the basis of potential diagnostic biomarkers for human Ov-associated CCA. The profile of protein dysregulation observed during chronic Ovinfection and then in Ov-induced CCA provides insight into the etiology of an infection-induced inflammation-related cancer.	PMC5417829

Assessment of renal response with urinary exosomes in patients with AL amyloidosis: A proof of concept.	Am J Hematol	2017	Immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a fatal complication of B-cell proliferation secondary to deposition of amyloid fibrils in various organs. Urinary exosomes (UEX) are the smallest of the microvesicles excreted in the urine. Previously, we found UEX of patients with AL amyloidosis contained immunoglobulin light chain (LC) oligomers that patients with multiple myeloma did not have. To further explore the role of the LC oligomers, UEX was isolated from an AL amyloidosis patient with progressive renal disease despite achieving a complete response. LC oligomers were identified. Mass spectrometry (MS) of the UEX and serum identified two monoclonal lambda LCs. Proteomics of the trypsin digested amyloid fragments in the kidney by laser microdissection and MS analysis identified a λ6 LC. The cDNA from plasma cell clone was from the IGLV- 6-57 family and it matched the amino acid sequences of the amyloid peptides. The predicted mass of the peptide product of the cDNA matched the mass of one of the two LCs identified in the UEX and serum. UEX combined with MS were able to identify 2 monoclonal lambda LCs that current clinical methods could not. It also identified the amyloidogenic LC which holds potential for response assessment in the future.

MicroRNA-183-5p Increases with Age in Bone-Derived Extracellular Vesicles, Suppresses Bone Marrow Stromal (Stem) Cell Proliferation, and Induces Stem Cell Senescence.	Tissue Eng Part A	2017	Microvesicle- and exosome-mediated transport of microRNAs (miRNAs) represents a novel cellular and molecular pathway for cell-cell communication. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their miRNAs might change with age, contributing to age-related stem cell dysfunction. EVs were isolated from the bone marrow interstitial fluid (supernatant) of young (3-4 months) and aged (24-28 months) mice to determine whether the size, concentration, and miRNA profile of EVs were altered with age in vivo. Results show that EVs isolated from bone marrow are CD63 and CD9 positive, and the concentration and size distribution of bone marrow EVs are similar between the young and aged mice. Bioanalyzer data indicate that EVs from both young and aged mice are highly enriched in miRNAs, and the miRNA profile of bone marrow EVs differs significantly between the young and aged mice. Specifically, the miR-183 cluster (miR-96/-182/-183) is highly expressed in aged EVs. In vitro assays demonstrate that aged EVs are endocytosed by primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), and these aged EVs inhibit the osteogenic differentiation of young BMSCs. Transfection of BMSCs with miR-183-5p mimic reduces cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, increases senescence, and decreases protein levels of the miR-183-5p target heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1). In vitro assays utilizing H2O2-induced oxidative stress show that H2O2 treatment of BMSCs increases the abundance of miR-183-5p in BMSC-derived EVs, and Amplex Red assays demonstrate that H2O2 is elevated in the bone marrow microenvironment with age. Together, these data indicate that aging and oxidative stress can significantly alter the miRNA cargo of EVs in the bone marrow microenvironment, which may in turn play a role in stem cell senescence and osteogenic differentiation by reducing Hmox1 activity.

Mesenchymal stem cells release exosomes that transfer miRNAs to endothelial cells and promote angiogenesis.	Oncotarget	2017	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been found to benefit patients with a variety of ischemic diseases via promoting angiogenesis. It is also well established that exosomes secreted from MSCs deliver bioactive molecules, including microRNAs (miRs) to recipient cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that exosomes secreted from MSCs deliver miRs into endothelial cells and mediate angiogenesis. The pro-angiogenic stimulatory capacity of exosomes was investigated using tube-like structure formation and spheroid-based sprouting of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and in vivo Matrigel plug assay. The secretion of pro-angiogenic miRs (pro-angiomiRs) from MSCs into culture medium and transfer of the miRs to HUVECs were confirmed using real-time quantitative PCR. Supplementation of the exosome secretion blocker GW4869 (10 μM) reduced the pro-angiomiRs in the MSC-derived conditioned medium (CdMMSC). Addition of exosomes isolated from CdMMSC could directly 1) promote HUVEC tube-like structure formation in vitro; 2) mobilize endothelial cells into Matrigel plug subcutaneously transplanted into mice; and 3) increase blood flow inside Matrigel plug. Fluorescence tracking showed that the exosomes were internalized rapidly by HUVECs causing an upregulated expression of pro-angiomiRs in HUVECs. Loss-and-gain function of the pro-angiomiRs (e.g., miR-30b) in MSCs significantly altered the pro-angiogenic properties of these MSC-derived exosomes, which could be associated with the regulation of their targets in HUVECs. These results suggest that exosomal transfer of pro-angiogenic miRs plays an important role in MSC mediated angiogenesis and stem cell-to-endothelial cell communication.	PMC5542178

Exosomes contribute to endothelial integrity and acute chest syndrome risk: Preliminary findings.	Pediatr Pulmonol	2017	BACKGROUND: Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) is one of the leading causes of death among children with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Disruption of microvascular integrity is critical to the pathophysiology of ACS, but the factors governing its phenotypic variability are incompletely understood. Because circulating exosomes have been implicated in vascular dysfunction in various diseases, we hypothesized that exosomes induce endothelial dysfunction in patients who experience ACS. PROCEDURE: Cross-sectional cohort study including 33 outpatients with SCD (without new health-related complaints or recent transfusions) and a cohort of control patients. Exosomes were isolated from platelet-free plasma. RESULTS: ImageStream showed that exosome counts were greatly increased in patients with SCD compared with controls, but there were few differences in the concentrations of exosomes between patients who had experienced ACS (ACS(+)) and those who had not (ACS(-)). Exosomes were added to human microvascular endothelial cells, and the exosomal effects on monolayer integrity was determined using Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS). Exosomes from SCD patients without ACS differed minimally from control patients; however, exosomes from ACS(+) decreased endothelial cell resistance compared to ACS(-), (Relative resistance: ACS(+): 0.981 ± 0.055 vs ACS(-): 1.124 ± 0.042; P = 0.006). Treatment of endothelial cultures with exosomes from ACS(-) patients increased endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) mRNA expression, while ACS(+)-derived exosomes were not able to increase eNOS expression above that of controls. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that patients with SCD have circulating exosomes that produce differential effects that may contribute to the pathophysiology of ACS and may serve as risk-related biomarkers.

Acta Biomater	2017	Cadmium selenide (CdSe) based quantum dots modified with polyethylene glycol and chemically linked to interleukin-13 (IL13) were prepared with the aim of identifying the high affinity receptor (IL13Rα2) which is expressed in glioma stem cells and exosomes secreted by these cancer stem cells. IL13 conjugated quantum dots (IL13QD) were thoroughly characterized for their physicochemical properties including particle size and surface morphology. Furthermore, the specific binding of the IL13QD to glioma cells and to glioma stem cells (GSC) was verified using a competitive binding study. The exosomes were isolated from the GSC conditioned medium and the expression of IL13Rα2 in the GSC and exosomes was verified. The binding property of IL13QD to the tumor associated exosomes was initially confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The force of attraction between the quantum dots and U251 glioma cells and the exosomes was investigated by atomic force microscopy, which indicated a higher force of binding interaction between the IL13QD and IL13Rα2 expressing glioma cells and exosomes secreted by glioma stem cells. Flow cytometry of the IL13QD and exosomes from the culture media and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with glioma tumors indicated a distinctly populated complex pattern different from that of non-targeted quantum dots and bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated quantum dots confirming specific binding potential of the IL13QD to the tumor associated exosomes. The results of this study demonstrate that IL13QD can serve as an ex vivo marker for glioma stem cells and exosomes that can inform diagnosis and prognosis of patients harboring malignant disease. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Functionalized quantum dots are flexible semiconductor nanomaterials which have an immense application in biomedical research. In particular, when they are functionalized with biomolecules like proteins or antibodies, they have the specialized ability to detect the expression of receptors and antigens in cells and tissues. In this study we designed a cytokine (interleukin-13) functionalized quantum dot to detect a cancer associated receptor expressed in cancer stem cells and the extracellular vesicles (exosomes) secreted by the cancer cells themselves. The binding pattern of these cytokine modified quantum dots to the cancer stem cells and exosomes alters the physical properties of the complex in the fixed and suspended form. This altered binding pattern can be monitored by a variety of techniques, including transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and flow cytometry, and subsequent characterization of this quantum dot binding profile provides useful data that can be utilized as a fingerprint to detect cancer disease progression. This type of functionalized quantum dot fingerprint is especially useful for invasive cancers including brain and other metastatic cancers and may allow for earlier detection of disease progression or recurrence, thus saving the lives of patients suffering from this devastating disease.

Hypoxia-Induced Changes in the Fibroblast Secretome, Exosome, and Whole-Cell Proteome Using Cultured, Cardiac-Derived Cells Isolated from Neonatal Mice.	J Proteome Res	2017	Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) represent a major subpopulation of cells in the developing and adult heart. Cardiomyocyte (CM) and CF intercellular communication occurs through paracrine interactions and modulate myocyte development and stress response. Detailed proteomic analysis of the CF secretome in normal and stressed conditions may offer insights into the role of CF in heart development and disease. Primary neonatal mouse CFs were isolated and cultured for 24 h in 21% (normoxic) or 2% (hypoxic) O2. Conditioned medium was separated to obtain exosomes (EXO) and EXO-depleted secretome fractions. Multidimensional protein identification technology was performed on secreted fractions. Whole cell lysate data were also generated to provide subcellular context to the secretome. Proteomic analysis identified 6163 unique proteins in total. Statistical (QSpec) analysis identified 494 proteins differentially expressed between fractions and oxygen conditions. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed hypoxic conditions selectively increase expression of proteins with extracellular matrix and signaling annotations. Finally, we subjected CM pretreated with CF secreted factors to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Viability assays suggested altered viability due to CF-derived factors. CF secretome proteomics revealed differential expression based on mode of secretion and oxygen levels in vitro.

Human milk exosomes and their microRNAs survive digestion in vitro and are taken up by human intestinal cells.	Mol Nutr Food Res	2017	SCOPE: Human milk exosomes provide a natural means of genetic material transfer to infants; however, the effect of gastric/pancreatic digestion milk exosomes stability and their microRNA content is largely unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We took a simulated gastric/pancreatic digestion protocol to perform in vitro digestion of milk exosomes, explore intestinal epithelial uptake, and further elucidate microRNA responses to digestion at early-, mid-, late lactation by massive parallel sequencing. Both undigested and digested exosomes enter human intestinal crypt-like cells (HIEC), with evidence of nuclear localization. We identified 288 mature microRNAs from all 24 exosome samples, and an additional 610 at low abundance. A large number of synapse development- and immune-related microRNAs were identified. hsa-miR-22-3p was the most abundant microRNA, and the top 15 microRNAs contributed ∼11% of the sequencing reads. Upon digestion, the overall microRNA abundance in human milk exosomes was stable. CONCLUSION: Our results for the first time reveal the survivability and complexity of human milk exosome microRNAs upon simulated gastric/pancreatic digestion, and the dynamics during lactation stages. The results suggest a previously underexplored area of infant response to genetic material in human milk exosomes.

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2017	Studies involving the functional analysis of exosomal contents including proteins, DNA, and RNA have been reported. Most membrane proteins and lipids are glycosylated, which controls their physical properties and functions, but little is known about glycans on exosomes owing to the difficulty of analysing them. To shed light on these issues, we collected exosomes from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from human adipose tissue for glycan profiling using evanescent-field fluorescence-assisted lectin array as well as analysis of their uptake in vivo. Initial analyses showed that the mean diameter of the collected exosomes was 178 nm and they presented with typical exosomal and MSC markers. Regarding the glycan profiling, exosomes interacted more strongly than the membrane of the original MSCs did with a range of lectins, especially sialic acid-binding lectins. The findings also showed that cellular exosome uptake involved recognition by HeLa cell-surface-bound sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin (Ig)-like lectins (siglecs). Confirming this siglec-related uptake, in vivo experiments involving subcutaneous injection of the fluorescently labelled exosomes into mice showed their transport into lymph nodes and internalization by antigen-presenting cells, particularly those expressing CD11b. Closer analysis revealed the colocalization of the exosomes with siglecs, indicating their involvement in the uptake. These findings provide us with an improved understanding of the importance of exosomal transport and targeting in relation to glycans on exosomal surfaces, potentially enabling us to standardize exosomes when using them for therapeutic purposes.

J Reprod Immunol	2017	Term labor in humans is associated with increased oxidative stress (OS) -induced senescence and damages to amnion epithelial cells (AECs). Senescent fetal cells release alarmin high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and cell-free fetal telomere fragments (cffTF) which can be carried by exosomes to other uterine tissues to produce parturition-associated inflammatory changes. This study characterized AEC-derived exosomes under normal and OS conditions and their packaging of HMGB1 and cffTF. Primary AECs were treated with either standard media or oxidative stress-induced media (exposure to cigarette smoke extract for 48h). Senescence was determined, and exosomes were isolated and characterized. To colocalize HMGB1 and cffTF in amnion exosomes, immunofluorescent staining and in situ hybridization were performed, followed by confocal microscopy. Next generation sequencing (NGS) determined exosomal cffTF and other cell-free amnion cell DNA specificity. Regardless of condition, primary AECs produce exosomes with a classic size, shape, and markers. OS and senescence caused the translocation of HMGB1 and cffTF from AECs' nuclei to cytoplasm compared to untreated cells, which was inhibited by antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Linescans confirmed colocalization of HMGB1 and cffTF in exosomes were higher in the cytoplasm after CSE treatment compared to untreated AECs. NGS determined that besides cffTF, AEC exosomes also carry genomic and mitochondrial DNA, regardless of growth conditions. Sterile inflammatory markers HMGB1 and cffTF from senescent fetal cells are packaged inside exosomes. We postulate that this exosomal cargo can act as a fetal signal at term and can cause labor-associated changes in neighboring tissues.	PMC5632595

Of the five candidate miRs identified by differential packaging in exosomes, only miR-26a-5p and miR-101-3p were significantly increased in AML-derived samples while miR-23b-5p, miR-339-3p and miR-425-5p were significantly decreased. Validation of the predicted change in gene expression of the potential targets was investigated by interrogating gene expression levels from public datasets of marrow-derived CD34-selected cells from patients with AML (n = 69) and healthy donors (n = 40). Two molecules with decreased gene expression in AML (EZH2 and GSK3β) were predicted by the miR profiling and have been previously implicated in AML while three molecules were increased in AML-derived cells and have not been previously associated with leukemogenesis (KRBA2, RRBP1 and HIST2H 2BE). In summary, profiling miRs in exosomes from AML-derived MSCs allowed us to identify candidate miRs with potential relevance in AML that could yield new insights regarding leukemogenesis or new treatment strategies.

Chemotherapy administration to breast cancer patients affects extracellular vesicles thrombogenicity and function.	Oncotarget	2017	Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent type of malignancy in women. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are subcellular membrane blebs that include exosomes and microparticles. STUDY AIMS: To elucidate the effects of chemotherapy administration on BC patients' EVs characteristics and their effects on endothelial cells (EC) functions. METHODS: EVs were isolated from the blood samples of 54 BC patients treated by chemotherapy (25 neo-adjuvant, 29 adjuvant) and from 20 healthy women (control group). Blood samples were taken before chemotherapy and on the day of last chemotherapy administration. In some patients, samples were also evaluated 24 hours after chemotherapy treatment. EVs were characterized by cell origin, thrombogenicity and cytokine content. EVs effects on coagulation, migration, apoptosis and proliferation of endothelial cells were assessed as well. RESULTS: Patient characteristics of the two subgroups were similar except for tumor size. Change in EV expression of BC markers, MUC1 and EpCAM, were found in patient subgroups. EC-EVs were significantly higher in both patient subgroups compared to healthy controls. Higher EVs pro-coagulant activity was found at the end of chemotherapy and a significant increase in the ratio between tissue factor (TF) and TF pathway inhibitor was documented after the first 24hours of exposure to doxorubicin treatment. Furthermore, EVs of neo-adjuvant patients obtained before chemotherapy contained more pro-angiogenic proteins, reduced endothelial cells apoptosis and increased their migration compared to EVs obtained at the same timing from adjuvant patients. CONCLUSIONS: EVs may serve as a biomarker for chemotherapy-related thrombogenicity and may indicate vascular damage even before chemotherapy.	PMC5609919

Front Aging Neurosci	2017	Community dwelling older individuals from the North Florida region were examined for health status and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), was performed on each participant. A subpopulation (58 females and 39 males) met the criteria for age (60-89) and no evidence of mild cognitive impairment, with a MoCA score ≥23. Despite the stringent criteria for participation, MoCA scores were negatively correlated within the limited age range. Extracellular microvesicles were isolated from the plasma and samples were found to be positive for the exosome marker CD63, with an enrichment of particles within the size range for exosomes. miRNA was extracted and examined using next generation sequencing with a stringent criterion (average of ≥10 counts per million reads) resulting in 117 miRNA for subsequent analysis. Characterization of expression confirmed pervious work concerning the relative abundance and overall pattern of expression of miRNA in plasma. Correlation analysis indicated that most of the miRNAs (74 miRNAs) were positively correlated with age (p <0.01). Multiple regression was employed to identify the relationship of miRNA expression and MoCA score, accounting for age. MoCA scores were negatively correlated with 13 miRNAs. The pattern of expression for cognition-related miRNA did not match that previously described for Alzheimer's disease. Enrichment analysis was employed to identify miRNA-gene interactions to reveal possible links to brain function.	PMC5632661

Electronic address: .	amasamune@med.tohoku.ac.jp		Exosomes derived from pancreatic cancer cells induce activation and profibrogenic activities in pancreatic stellate cells.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2018	Pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) interact with pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), which play a pivotal role in pancreatic fibrogenesis, to develop the cancer-conditioned tumor microenvironment. Exosomes are membrane-enclosed nanovesicles, and have been increasingly recognized as important mediators of cell-to-cell communications. The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of PCC-derived exosomes on cell functions in PSCs. Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned medium of Panc-1 and SUIT-2 PCCs. Human primary PSCs were treated with PCC-derived exosomes. PCC-derived exosomes stimulated the proliferation, migration, activation of ERK and Akt, the mRNA expression of α-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and fibrosis-related genes, and procollagen type I C-peptide production in PSCs. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the microarray data identified transforming growth factor β1 and tumor necrosis factor as top upstream regulators. PCCs increased the expression of miR-1246 and miR-1290, abundantly contained in PCC-derived exosomes, in PSCs. Overexpression of miR-1290 induced the expression of ACTA2 and fibrosis-related genes in PSCs. In conclusion, PCC-derived exosomes stimulate activation and profibrogenic activities in PSCs. Exosome-mediated interactions between PSCs and PCCs might play a role in the development of the tumor microenvironment.

Infect Immun	2018	Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a Gram-negative bacterium, which can invade and survive within macrophages. Pathogenic salmonellae induce the secretion of specific cytokines from these phagocytic cells and interfere with the host secretory pathways. In this study, we describe the extracellular proteome of human macrophages infected with S Typhimurium, followed by analysis of canonical pathways of proteins isolated from the extracellular milieu. We demonstrate that some of the proteins secreted by macrophages upon S Typhimurium infection are released via exosomes. Moreover, we show that infected macrophages produce CD63+ and CD9+ subpopulations of exosomes at 2 h postinfection. Exosomes derived from infected macrophages trigger the Toll-like receptor 4-dependent release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) from naive macrophages and dendritic cells, but they also stimulate secretion of such cytokines as RANTES, IL-1ra, MIP-2, CXCL1, MCP-1, sICAM-1, GM-CSF, and G-CSF. Proinflammatory effects of exosomes are partially attributed to lipopolysaccharide, which is encapsulated within exosomes. In summary, we show for the first time that proinflammatory exosomes are formed in the early phase of macrophage infection with S Typhimurium and that they can be used to transfer cargo to naive cells, thereby leading to their stimulation.

Resistance to HER2-targeted anti-cancer drugs is associated with immune evasion in cancer cells and their derived extracellular vesicles.	Oncoimmunology	2017	Neuromedin U (NmU) -a neuropeptide belonging to the neuromedin family- plays a substantial role in HER2-positive breast cancer, correlating with increased aggressiveness, resistance to HER2-targeted therapies and overall significantly poorer outcome for patients. However, the mechanism through which it exerts these effects remains unclear. To elucidate this, initially we used HER2-positive breast cancer cells stably over-expressing NmU. These cells and their released extracellular vesicles (EVs) had increased amounts of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGFβ1 and the lymphocyte activation inhibitor PD-L1. Furthermore, these cells also showed enhanced resistance to antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by trastuzumab, indicating a role of NmU in enhancing immune evasion. All these features were also found in HER2-targeted drug-resistant cells which we previously found to express higher levels of NmU than their drug-sensitive counterparts. Interestingly, EVs from drug-resistant cells were able to increase levels of TGFβ1 in drug-sensitive cells. In our neo-adjuvant clinical trial, TGFβ1 levels were significantly higher in EVs isolated from the serum of patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancers who went on to not respond to HER2-targeted drug treatment, compared with those who experienced complete or partial response. Taken together, our results report a new mechanism-of-action for NmU in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer that enhances resistance to the anti-tumor immune response. Furthermore, EV levels of TGFβ1 correlating with patients' response versus resistance to HER2-targeted drugs suggests a potential use of EV-TGFβ1 as a minimally-invasive companion diagnostic for such treatment in breast cancer.

Exosomal microRNAs derived from colorectal cancer-associated fibroblasts: role in driving cancer progression.	Aging (Albany NY)	2017	Colorectal cancer is a global disease with increasing incidence. Mortality is largely attributed to metastatic spread and therefore, a mechanistic dissection of the signals which influence tumor progression is needed. Cancer stroma plays a critical role in tumor proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance. Here, we sought to identify and characterize exosomal microRNAs as mediators of stromal-tumor signaling. In vitro, we demonstrated that fibroblast exosomes are transferred to colorectal cancer cells, with a resultant increase in cellular microRNA levels, impacting proliferation and chemoresistance. To probe this further, exosomal microRNAs were profiled from paired patient-derived normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts, from an ongoing prospective biomarker study. An exosomal cancer-associated fibroblast signature consisting of microRNAs 329, 181a, 199b, 382, 215 and 21 was identified. Of these, miR-21 had highest abundance and was enriched in exosomes. Orthotopic xenografts established with miR-21-overexpressing fibroblasts and CRC cells led to increased liver metastases compared to those established with control fibroblasts. Our data provide a novel stromal exosome signature in colorectal cancer, which has potential for biomarker validation. Furthermore, we confirmed the importance of stromal miR-21 in colorectal cancer progression using an orthotopic model, and propose that exosomes are a vehicle for miR-21 transfer between stromal fibroblasts and cancer cells.

Adv Drug Deliv Rev	2018	Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) originate from the primary tumor mass and enter into the peripheral bloodstream. Compared to other "liquid biopsy" portfolios such as exosome, circulating tumor DNA/RNA (ctDNA/RNA), CTCs have incomparable advantages in analyses of transcriptomics, proteomics, and signal colocalization. Hence, CTCs hold the key to understanding the biology of metastasis and play a vital role in cancer diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and prognosis. Size-based enrichment features are prominent in CTC isolation. It is a label-free, simple and fast method. Enriched CTCs remain unmodified and viable for a wide range of subsequent analyses. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the differences of size and deformability between CTCs and blood cells, which would facilitate the development of technologies of size-based CTC isolation. Then we review representative size-/deformability-based technologies available for CTC isolation and highlight the recent achievements in molecular analysis of isolated CTCs. To wrap up, we discuss the substantial challenges facing the field, and elaborate on prospects.

Astroglial major histocompatibility complex class I following immune activation leads to behavioral and neuropathological changes.	Glia	2018	In the central nervous system, major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecules are mainly expressed in neurons, and neuronal MHCI have roles in synapse elimination and plasticity. However, the pathophysiological significance of astroglial MHCI remains unclear. We herein demonstrate that MHCI expression is up-regulated in astrocytes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) following systemic immune activation by an intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) or hydrodynamic interferon (IFN)-γ gene delivery in male C57/BL6J mice. In cultured astrocytes, MHCI/H-2D largely co-localized with exosomes. To investigate the role of astroglial MHCI, H-2D, or sH-2D was expressed in the mPFC of male C57/BL6J mice using an adeno-associated virus vector under the control of a glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter. The expression of astroglial MHCI in the mPFC impaired sociability and recognition memory in mice. Regarding neuropathological changes, MHCI expression in astrocytes significantly activated microglial cells, decreased parvalbumin-positive cell numbers, and reduced dendritic spine density in the mPFC. A treatment with GW4869 that impairs exosome synthesis ameliorated these behavioral and neuropathological changes. These results suggest that the overexpression of MHCI in astrocytes affects microglial proliferation as well as neuronal numbers and spine densities, thereby leading to social and cognitive deficits in mice, possibly via exosomes created by astrocytes.

Electronic address: .	gerardo.palazzo@uniba.it		Counting of peripheral extracellular vesicles in Multiple Sclerosis patients by an improved nanoplasmonic assay and dynamic light scattering.	Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces	2018	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are vesicles naturally secreted by the majority of human cells. Being composed by a closed phospholipid bilayer secluding proteins and RNAs they are used to transfer molecular information to other cells, thereby influencing the recipient cell functions. Despite the increasingly recognized relevance of EVs, the clarification of their physiological role is hampered by the lack of suitable analytical tools for their quantification and characterization. In this study, we have implemented a nanoplasmonic assay, previously proposed for the purity of the EV fractions, to achieve a robust analytical protocol in order to quantify the total phospholipid concentration (CPL) and the EVs number. We show how the coupling of the nanoplasmonic assay with serial dilutions of the unknown sample allows, by simple visual inspection, to detect deviations from the physiological EVs content. The use of a response that depends on the absorbance values at three wavelengths permits to reduce the limit of detection of CPL to 5 μM (total) and the limit of quantification to 35 μM. We also propose a method that takes into account the spread in EV size when the concentration of phospholipids is turned into a concentration of vesicles. The proposed analytical protocol is successfully applied to a small cohort of Multiple Sclerosis patients examined in different stages of their clinical diseases.

Isolation of Exosome-Like Nanoparticles and Analysis of MicroRNAs Derived from Coconut Water Based on Small RNA High-Throughput Sequencing.	J Agric Food Chem	2018	In this study, the presence of microRNAs in coconut water was identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the results of high-throughput small RNA sequencing. In addition, the differences in microRNA content between immature and mature coconut water were compared. A total of 47 known microRNAs belonging to 25 families and 14 new microRNAs were identified in coconut endosperm. Through analysis using a target gene prediction software, potential microRNA target genes were identified in the human genome. Real-time PCR showed that the level of most microRNAs was higher in mature coconut water than in immature coconut water. Then, exosome-like nanoparticles were isolated from coconut water. After ultracentrifugation, some particle structures were seen in coconut water samples using 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate fluorescence staining. Subsequent scanning electron microscopy observation and dynamic light scattering analysis also revealed some exosome-like nanoparticles in coconut water, and the mean diameters of the particles detected by the two methods were 13.16 and 59.72 nm, respectively. In conclusion, there are extracellular microRNAs in coconut water, and their levels are higher in mature coconut water than in immature coconut water. Some exosome-like nanoparticles were isolated from coconut water, and the diameter of these particles was smaller than that of animal-derived exosomes.

Oncogene	2018	Benefiting from more precise imaging and radiotherapy, patients with locoregionally nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have a significantly higher survival rate. Nonetheless, distant metastasis is still the predominant mode of failure. Advances in cancer research have highlighted that pathological angiogenesis is necessary for tumor metastasis by offering oxygen, nutrients, or cell metastatic conduits. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding RNAs, are increasingly implicated in modulation of angiogenesis in physiological and pathological conditions. Currently, we detected that miR-23a was highly enriched in NPC tissues at the metastatic or premetastatic stage, and its levels in NPC were associated with microvessel density. Subsequently, we proved that alteration of miR-23a expression modulated the growth, migration, and tube formation of HUVECs in vitro and affected the blood vessel outgrowth in the zebrafish model. Considering the possibility that extracellular miR-23a was horizontally transferred from CNE2 cells to HUVECs, we analyzed miR-23a encapsulated in exosomes, showing that overexpression of exosomal miR-23a in NPC promoted angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we provided evidences that miR-23a regulated angiogenesis by directly targeting testis-specific gene antigen (TSGA10). Taken together, our findings revealed that metastasis-associated miR-23a from NPC-derived exosomes plays an important role in mediating angiogenesis by targeting TSGA10.

Exosomal DMBT1 from human urine-derived stem cells facilitates diabetic wound repair by promoting angiogenesis.	Theranostics	2018	Chronic non-healing wounds represent one of the most common complications of diabetes and need advanced treatment strategies. Exosomes are key mediators of cell paracrine action and can be directly utilized as therapeutic agents for tissue repair and regeneration. Here, we explored the effects of exosomes from human urine-derived stem cells (USC-Exos) on diabetic wound healing and the underlying mechanism. Methods: USCs were characterized by flow cytometry and multipotent differentiation potential analyses. USC-Exos were isolated from the conditioned media of USCs and identified by transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry. A series of functional assays in vitro were performed to assess the effects of USC-Exos on the activities of wound healing-related cells. Protein profiles in USC-Exos and USCs were examined to screen the candidate molecules that mediate USC-Exos function. The effects of USC-Exos on wound healing in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were tested by measuring wound closure rates, histological and immunofluorescence analyses. Meanwhile, the role of the candidate protein in USC-Exos-induced regulation of angiogenic activities of endothelial cells and diabetic wound healing was assessed. Results: USCs were positive for CD29, CD44, CD73 and CD90, but negative for CD34 and CD45. USCs were able to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes. USC-Exos exhibited a cup- or sphere-shaped morphology with a mean diameter of 51.57 ± 2.93 nm and positive for CD63 and TSG101. USC-Exos could augment the functional properties of wound healing-related cells including the angiogenic activities of endothelial cells. USC-Exos were enriched in the proteins that are involved in regulation of wound healing-related biological processes. Particularly, a pro-angiogenic protein called deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1) was highly expressed in USC-Exos. Further functional assays showed that DMBT1 protein was required for USC-Exos-induced promotion of angiogenic responses of cultured endothelial cells, as well as angiogenesis and wound healing in diabetic mice. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that USC-Exos may represent a promising strategy for diabetic soft tissue wound healing by promoting angiogenesis via transferring DMBT1 protein.	PMC5858170

Exosomal Tat protein activates latent HIV-1 in primary, resting CD4+ T lymphocytes.	JCI Insight	2018	Replication competent HIV-1 persists in a subpopulation of CD4+ T lymphocytes despite prolonged antiretroviral treatment. This residual reservoir of infected cells harbors transcriptionally silent provirus capable of reigniting productive infection upon discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy. Certain classes of drugs can activate latent virus but not at levels that lead to reductions in HIV-1 reservoir size in vivo. Here, we show the utility of CD4+ receptor targeting exosomes as an HIV-1 latency reversal agent (LRA). We engineered human cellular exosomes to express HIV-1 Tat, a protein that is a potent transactivator of viral transcription. Preparations of exosomal Tat-activated HIV-1 in primary, resting CD4+ T lymphocytes isolated from antiretroviral-treated individuals with prolonged periods of viral suppression and led to the production of replication competent HIV-1. Furthermore, exosomal Tat increased the potency of selected LRA by over 30-fold in terms of HIV-1 mRNA expression, thereby establishing it as a potentially new class of biologic product with possible combinatorial utility in targeting latent HIV-1.

Exosomes Released by Gastric Cancer Cells Induce Transition of Pericytes Into Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts.	Med Sci Monit	2018	BACKGROUND Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are functionally and structurally essential for tumor progression. There are 3 main origins of CAFs: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition cells, and tissue-resident cells. Pericytes retain characteristics of progenitor cells and can differentiate into other cells under normal physiological conditions and into myofibroblasts under pathological conditions. Exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by transferring membrane components and nucleic acids between different cells. In this study, we evaluated whether cancer cell-derived exosomes are involved in regulating the transition of pericytes to CAFs. MATERIAL AND METHODS Exosomes from GES-1 and SGC7901 cells were isolated by serial centrifugation and purified from the supernatant by the 30% sucrose/D2O cushion method. A transmission electron microscope was used to observe exosome morphologies, and nanoparticle tracking analysis was used to analyze size distribution of exosomes. Western blot analysis, immunofluorescent staining, and qPCR were employed to detect CAFs marker expression and signaling pathways involved in CAFs transition. RESULTS Gastric cancer cell-derived exosomes enhanced pericytes proliferation and migration and induced the expression of CAFs marker in pericytes. We then demonstrated that the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways were activated by tumor-derived exosomes, and BMP pathway inhibition reverses cancer exosomes-induced CAFs transition. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that gastric cancer cells induce the transition of pericytes to CAFs by exosomes-mediated BMP transfer and PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathway activation, and suggest that pericytes may be an important source of CAFs.

Macrophage-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Induce Long-Lasting Immunity Against Hepatitis C Virus Which Is Blunted by Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids.	Front Immunol	2018	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication. In this study, we aimed to further characterize the role of macrophage-derived EVs in immune responses against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the potential of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to modulate this modality of innate immunity. To this end, EVs were isolated from interferon-stimulated macrophage cultures or from serum of patients with acute or chronic hepatitis C. EVs were characterized by electron microscopy, flow cytometry, RNA-sequencing, and Western blot analysis. The effect of EVs on replication of HCV was assessed in coculture models. Functional analyses were performed to assess the impact of PUFAs on EV-mediated antiviral immunity. We found that macrophages secreted various cytokines shortly after stimulation with type I and II IFN, which orchestrated a fast but short-lasting antiviral state. This rapid innate immune answer was followed by the production of macrophage-derived EVs, which induced a late, but long-lasting inhibitory effect on HCV replication. Of note, exposure of macrophages to PUFAs, which are important regulators of immune responses, dampened EV-mediated antiviral immune responses. Finally, EVs from patients with hepatitis C exhibited long-lasting antiviral activities during IFN therapy as well. The antiviral effect of EVs from Caucasian and Japanese patients differed, which may be explained by different nutritional uptake of PUFAs. In conclusion, our data indicate that macrophage-derived EVs mediate long-lasting inhibitory effects on HCV replication, which may bridge the time until efficient adaptive immune responses are established, and which can be blunted by PUFAs.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2018	Obesity is characterized by an accumulation of macrophages in adipose, some of which form distinct crown-like structures (CLS) around fat cells. While multiple discrete adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) subsets are thought to exist, their respective effects on adipose tissue, and the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie the functional differences between ATM subsets, are not well understood. We report that obese fat tissue of mice and humans contain multiple distinct populations of ATMs with unique tissue distributions, transcriptomes, chromatin landscapes, and functions. Mouse Ly6c ATMs reside outside of CLS and are adipogenic, while CD9 ATMs reside within CLS, are lipid-laden, and are proinflammatory. Adoptive transfer of Ly6c ATMs into lean mice activates gene programs typical of normal adipocyte physiology. By contrast, adoptive transfer of CD9 ATMs drives gene expression that is characteristic of obesity. Importantly, human adipose tissue contains similar ATM populations, including lipid-laden CD9 ATMs that increase with body mass. These results provide a higher resolution of the cellular and functional heterogeneity within ATMs and provide a framework within which to develop new immune-directed therapies for the treatment of obesity and related sequela.

Intestinal epithelial exosomes carry MHC class II/peptides able to inform the immune system in mice.	Gut	2003	BACKGROUND: Intestinal epithelial cells secrete exosome-like vesicles. The aim of this study was to characterise murine intestinal epithelial exosomes and to analyse their capacity to inform the immune system in vivo in mice. METHODS: Epithelial exosomes were obtained from the murine epithelial cell line MODE K incubated in the presence or absence of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) together with pepsin/trypsin ovalbumin hydrolysate (hOVA) to mimic luminal digestion. Exosomes isolated from MODE K conditioned media (EXO-hOVA and EXO-hOVA-IFN) were characterised by western blot, peptide mapping, and mass spectrometry. They were injected intraperitoneally to C3H/HeN mice to test their immunocompetence. RESULTS: MODE K epithelial exosomes displayed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II (upregulated by IFN-gamma) molecules and tetraspan proteins (CD9, CD81, CD82) potentially involved in the binding to target cells. A33 antigen, an Ig-like molecule highly specific for intestinal epithelial cells, was enriched in exosomes and was also found in mice mesenteric lymph nodes, suggesting exosome migration towards the gut associated lymphoid tissues. Intraperitoneal injection of EXO-hOVA or EXO-hOVA-IFN did not induce humoral or cellular tolerance to OVA in mice. In contrast, exosomes obtained after incubation with IFN-gamma (EXO-hOVA-IFN), bearing abundant MHC class II/OVA complexes, induced a specific humoral immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Epithelial exosomes are antigen presenting vesicles bearing MHC class II/peptide complexes that prime for an immunogenic rather than tolerogenic response in the context of a systemic challenge. In the intestine, both the mucosal microenvironment and local effector cells are probably key players in determining the outcome of the immune response to exosome derived epitopes.	PMC1773888

Blood Cells Mol Dis	2005 Sep-Oct	Exosomes are vesicles of endocytic origin secreted spontaneously by dendritic cells (DCs). We have shown previously that exosomes can transfer antigen or MHC-peptide complexes between DCs, thus potentially amplifying the immune response. We had also identified milk fat globule EGF/factor VIII (MFG-E8), also called lactadherin, as one of the major exosomal proteins. MFG-E8 has two domains: an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence that binds integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 (expressed by human DCs and macrophages) and a phosphatidyl-serine (PS) binding sequence through which it associates to PS-containing membranes (among which exosomes). MFG-E8 is thus a good candidate molecule to address exosomes to DCs. Here, we show that MFG-E8 is expressed by immature bone-marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) and secreted in association with exosomes in vitro. We have generated mice expressing an inactive form of MFG-E8, fused to beta-galactosidase. Analyzing these mice, we demonstrate that MFG-E8 is expressed in vivo in splenic DCs. In a mouse DC-dependent, antigen-specific, CD4 T cell-stimulation assay, exosomes produced by MFG-E8-deficient BMDCs were barely less efficient than exosomes bearing MFG-E8. We conclude that MFG-E8 is efficiently targeted to exosomes but is not essential to address exosomes to mouse BMDCs. Involvement of MFG-E8/lactadherin in exosome targeting to other DC subpopulations, or to human DCs, is still possible.

We aimed to discover biomarkers in urinary exosomes to detect acute kidney injury (AKI), which has a high mortality and morbidity. Animals were injected with cisplatin. Urinary exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation. Protein changes were evaluated by two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis and changed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The identified candidate biomarkers were validated by Western blotting in individual urine samples from rats subjected to cisplatin injection; bilateral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R); volume depletion; and intensive care unit (ICU) patients with and without AKI. We identified 18 proteins that were increased and nine proteins that were decreased 8 h after cisplatin injection. Most of the candidates could not be validated by Western blotting. However, exosomal Fetuin-A increased 52.5-fold at day 2 (1 day before serum creatinine increase and tubule damage) and remained elevated 51.5-fold at day 5 (peak renal injury) after cisplatin injection. By immunoelectron microscopy and elution studies, Fetuin-A was located inside urinary exosomes. Urinary Fetuin-A was increased 31.6-fold in the early phase (2-8 h) of I/R, but not in prerenal azotemia. Urinary exosomal Fetuin-A also increased in three ICU patients with AKI compared to the patients without AKI. We conclude that (1) proteomic analysis of urinary exosomes can provide biomarker candidates for the diagnosis of AKI and (2) urinary Fetuin-A might be a predictive biomarker of structural renal injury.

MHC class II+ exosomes in plasma suppress inflammation in an antigen-specific and Fas ligand/Fas-dependent manner.	J Immunol	2007	Exosomes are 50- to 100-nm vesicles that are formed within the late endocytic compartment and released from a variety of cell types. Previously, we demonstrated that exosomes derived from dendritic cells transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing IL-10, IL-4, or Fas ligand (FasL) produce anti-inflammatory exosomes able to reduce inflammation in a murine paw delayed-type hypersensitivity model, suppress the onset on murine collagen-induced arthritis, and reduce the severity of established collagen-induce arthritis. In this study, we examined the ability of endogenous, blood-borne exosomes to regulate the immune response. Exosomes isolated from plasma of mice immunized to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, but not from naive or OVA-immunized mice, were able to suppress the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity inflammatory response. The anti-inflammatory effect was mediated by MHC class II(+) plasma exosomes that were also FasL(+) and CD11b(+), but CD11c(-). Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effect of the MHC class II(+) plasma-derived exosomes was, in part, dependent upon the presence of FasL in the exosomes and Fas in the recipient mouse. These results suggest that exosomes in the plasma, produced by MHC class II(+) and CD11b(+) cells, have the ability to suppress the immune response in an Ag-specific manner in part through a Fas/FasL-dependent manner.

Urinary exosomal transcription factors, a new class of biomarkers for renal disease.	Kidney Int	2008	Urinary exosomes are excreted from all nephron segments and constitute a rich source of intracellular kidney injury biomarkers. To study whether they contain transcription factors, we collected urine from two acute kidney injury models (cisplatin or ischemia-reperfusion), two podocyte injury models (puromycin-treated rats or podocin-Vpr transgenic mice) and from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, acute kidney injury and matched controls. Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation and found to contain activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and Wilms Tumor 1 (WT-1) proteins detected by Western blot. These factors were found in the concentrated exosomal fraction, but not in whole urine. ATF3 was continuously present in urine exosomes of the rat models following acute injury at times earlier than the increase in serum creatinine. ATF3 was found in exosomes isolated from patients with acute kidney injury but not from patients with chronic kidney disease or controls. Urinary WT-1 was present in animal models before significant glomerular sclerosis and in 9/10 patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis but not in 8 controls. Our findings suggest that transcription factor ATF3 may provide a novel renal tubular cell biomarker for acute kidney injury while WT-1 may detect early podocyte injury. Measurement of urinary exosomal transcription factors may offer insight into cellular regulatory pathways.	PMC2562924

Methods Enzymol	2008	Controlled degradation of RNA is important for the regulation of gene expression in Bacteria and Eukarya, but information about these processes is limited in the domain of Archaea. To address this, we studied the half-life of different mRNAs in halophilic Archaea after blocking transcription with actinomycin D. We found that the stability of mRNAs of the gvp operons in Haloferax mediterranei varies under different growth conditions. To understand regulated mRNA decay in Archaea, we need to identify stability determinants within mRNAs and proteins, mainly ribonucleases (RNases), which recognize these determinants. First, we wanted to identify archaeal RNases independently of their sequence similarity to known RNases from Bacteria and Eukarya. To this end we performed fractionation of proteins from Halobacterium salinarum and tested the fractions for RNase activity with an internally labeled in vitro-synthesized mRNA. After three purification steps, we isolated an endoribonucleolytically active protein with similarities to the eukaryotic initiation factor 5A. Further characterization was performed with recombinant halobacterial IF-5A, which was purified from H. salinarum or Escherichia coli. Mutational analysis confirmed unambiguously its RNase activity. In another study, we aimed to purify a double-strand-specific endoribonuclease from Sulfolobus solfataricus. Seven purification steps led to the isolation of two different dehydrogenases with RNase properties. Interestingly, their RNase activity resembled that of aIF-5A and of highly diluted RNase A. RNA was cleaved preferentially between C and A nucleotides in single-stranded regions, and the activity was inhibited at MgCl(2) concentrations >5 mM and at KCl concentrations >200 mM. However, it was possible to distinguish the activity of the archaeal proteins from the activity of RNase A. In a different approach, we used a bioinformatics prediction of the archaeal exosome to purify this protein complex from S. solfataricus. Isolation by coimmunoprecipitation revealed the presence of four orthologs of eukaryotic exosomal subunits and at least one archaea-specific subunit. We characterized the S. solfataricus exosome as a major enzyme involved in phosphorolytic RNA degradation and in RNA polyadenylation. Here we describe in detail the techniques used to achieve these results.

J Neural Transm (Vienna)	2010	Cells can exchange information not only by means of chemical and/or electrical signals, but also via microvesicles released into the intercellular space. The present paper, for the first time, provides evidence that Glioblastoma and Astrocyte cells release microvesicles, which carry mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These microvesicles have been characterised as exosomes in view of the presence of some protein markers of exosomes, such as Tsg101, CD9 and Alix. Thus, the important finding has been obtained that bonafide exosomes, constitutively released by Glioblastoma cells and Astrocytes, can carry mtDNA, which can be, therefore, transferred between cells. This datum may help the understanding of some diseases due to mitochondrial alterations.

Methods Mol Biol	2010	Exosomes represent an important and readily isolated subset of the urinary proteome that has the potential to shed much insight on the health status of the kidney. Each segment of the nephron sheds exosomes into the urine. Exosomes are rich in potential biomarkers, especially membrane proteins such as transporters and receptors that may be up- or downregulated during disease states. Two differential centrifugation methods are available for simple purification of exosomes: one uses ultracentrifugation, and the other uses a nanomembrane concentrator. Validation methods include western blots of pan-exosome markers and segment-specific exosome markers, and negative staining electron microscopy.

Biogenesis of a specialized plant-fungal interface during host cell internalization of Golovinomyces orontii haustoria.	Cell Microbiol	2011	Powdery mildew fungi are biotrophic pathogens that require living plant cells for their growth and reproduction. Elaboration of a specialized cell called a haustorium is essential for their pathogenesis, providing a portal into host cells for nutrient uptake and delivery of virulence effectors. Haustoria are enveloped by a modified plant plasma membrane, the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM), and an extrahaustorial matrix (EHMx), across which molecular exchange must occur, but the origin and composition of this interfacial zone remains obscure. Here we present a method for isolating Golovinomyces orontii haustoria from Arabidopsis leaves and an ultrastructural characterization of the haustorial interface. Haustoria were progressively encased by deposits of plant cell wall polymers, delivered by secretory vesicles and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that ultimately become entrapped within the encasement. The EHM and EHMx were not labelled by antibodies recognizing eight plant cell wall and plasma membrane antigens. However, plant resistance protein RPW8.2 was specifically recruited to the EHMs of mature haustoria. Fungal cell wall-associated molecular patterns such as chitin and β-1,3-glucans were exposed at the surface of haustoria. Fungal MVBs were abundant in haustoria and putative exosome vesicles were detected in the paramural space and EHMx, suggesting the existence of an exosome-mediated secretion pathway.

Selective transfer of exosomes from oligodendrocytes to microglia by macropinocytosis.	J Cell Sci	2011	The transfer of antigens from oligodendrocytes to immune cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Here, we show that oligodendrocytes secrete small membrane vesicles called exosomes, which are specifically and efficiently taken up by microglia both in vitro and in vivo. Internalisation of exosomes occurs by a macropinocytotic mechanism without inducing a concomitant inflammatory response. After stimulation of microglia with interferon-γ, we observe an upregulation of MHC class II in a subpopulation of microglia. However, exosomes are preferentially internalised in microglia that do not seem to have antigen-presenting capacity. We propose that the constitutive macropinocytotic clearance of exosomes by a subset of microglia represents an important mechanism through which microglia participate in the degradation of oligodendroglial membrane in an immunologically 'silent' manner. By designating the capacity for macropinocytosis and antigen presentation to distinct cells, degradation and immune function might be assigned to different subtypes of microglia.

Proteomic characterization of thymocyte-derived microvesicles and apoptotic bodies in BALB/c mice.	J Proteomics	2011	Several studies have characterized exosomes derived from different cell sources. In this work we set the goal of proteomic characterization of two less studied populations of membrane vesicles, microvesicles (100-800 nm) and apoptotic bodies (> 800 nm) released by thymus cells of BALB/c mice. The vesicles were isolated by the combination of differential centrifugation and gravity driven multistep filtration of the supernatant of thymus cell cultures. The size distribution of vesicle preparations was determined by transmission electron microscopy. Proteins were released from the vesicles, digested in solution, and analyzed using nano-HPLC/MS(MS). Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify functions related to membrane vesicle proteins. In apoptotic bodies and microvesicles we have identified 142 and 195 proteins, respectively. A striking overlap was detected between the proteomic compositions of the two subcellular structures as 108 proteins were detected in both preparations. Identified proteins included autoantigens implicated in human autoimmune diseases, key regulators of T-cell activation, molecules involved in known immune functions or in leukocyte rolling and transendothelial transmigration. The presence and abundance of proteins with high immunological relevance within thymocyte-derived apoptotic bodies and microvesicles raise the possibility that these subcellular structures may substantially modulate T-cell maturation processes within the thymus.

Mechanism of transfer of functional microRNAs between mouse dendritic cells via exosomes.	Blood	2012	Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent APCs. Whereas immature DCs down-regulate T-cell responses to induce/maintain immunologic tolerance, mature DCs promote immunity. To amplify their functions, DCs communicate with neighboring DCs through soluble mediators, cell-to-cell contact, and vesicle exchange. Transfer of nanovesicles (< 100 nm) derived from the endocytic pathway (termed exosomes) represents a novel mechanism of DC-to-DC communication. The facts that exosomes contain exosome-shuttle miRNAs and DC functions can be regulated by exogenous miRNAs, suggest that DC-to-DC interactions could be mediated through exosome-shuttle miRNAs, a hypothesis that remains to be tested. Importantly, the mechanism of transfer of exosome-shuttle miRNAs from the exosome lumen to the cytosol of target cells is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that DCs release exosomes with different miRNAs depending on the maturation of the DCs. By visualizing spontaneous transfer of exosomes between DCs, we demonstrate that exosomes fused with the target DCs, the latter followed by release of the exosome content into the DC cytosol. Importantly, exosome-shuttle miRNAs are functional, because they repress target mRNAs of acceptor DCs. Our findings unveil a mechanism of transfer of exosome-shuttle miRNAs between DCs and its role as a means of communication and posttranscriptional regulation between DCs.	PMC3265200

Mol Immunol	2012	Exosomes are small RNA containing vesicles of endocytic origin, which can take part in cell-to-cell communication partly by the transfer of exosomal RNA between cells. Exosomes are released by many cells and can also be found in several biological fluids including blood plasma and breast milk. Exosomes differ compared to their donor cells not only in size but also in RNA, protein and lipid composition. The aim of the current study was to determine the optimal RNA extraction method for analysis of exosomal RNA, to support future studies determining the biological roles of the exosomal RNA. Different methods were used to extract exosomal and cellular RNA. All methods evaluated extracted high quality and purity RNA as determined by RNA integrity number (RIN) and OD values for cellular RNA using capillary electrophoresis and spectrophotometer. Interestingly, the exosomal RNA yield differed substantially between the different RNA isolation methods. There was also a difference in the exosomal RNA patterns in the electropherograms, indicating that the tested methods extract exosomal RNA with different size distribution. A pure column based approach resulted in the highest RNA yield and the broadest RNA size distribution, whereas phenol and combined phenol and column based approaches lost primarily large RNAs. Moreover, the use of phenol and combined techniques resulted in reduced yield of exosomal RNA, with a more narrow size distribution pattern resulting in an enrichment of small RNA including microRNA. In conclusion, the current study presents a unique comparison of seven different methods for extraction of exosomal RNA. As the different isolation methods give extensive variation in exosomal RNA yield and patterns, it is crucial to select an isolation approach depending on the research question at hand.

Nanoparticle-induced exosomes target antigen-presenting cells to initiate Th1-type immune activation.	Small	2012	The mechanisms associated with the induction of systemic immune responses by nanoparticles are not fully understood, but their elucidation is critical to address safety issues associated with the broader medical application of nanotechnology. In this study, a key role of nanoparticle-induced exosomes (extracellularly secreted membrane vesicles) as signaling mediators in the induction of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) immune activation is demonstrated. In vivo exposure to magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONs) results in significant exosome generation in the alveolar region of Balb/c mice. These act as a source of nanoparticle-induced, membrane-bound antigen/signaling cargo, which transfer their components to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the reticuloendothelial system. Through exosome-initiated signals, immature dendritic cells (iDCs) undergo maturation and differentiation to the DC1 subtype, while macrophages go through classical activation and differentiation to the M1 subtype. Simultaneously, iDCs and macrophages release various Th1 cytokines (including interleukin-12 and tumor necrosis factor α) driving T-cell activation and differentiation. Activated APCs (especially DC1 and M1 subtypes) consequently prime T-cell differentiation towards a Th1 subtype, thereby resulting in an orchestrated Th1-type immune response. Th1-polarized immune activation is associated with delayed-type hypersensitivity, which might underlie the long-term inflammatory effects frequently associated with nanoparticle exposure. These studies suggest that nanoparticle-induced exosomes provoke the immune activation and inflammatory responses that can accompany nanoparticle exposure.

Small RNA deep sequencing reveals a distinct miRNA signature released in exosomes from prion-infected neuronal cells.	Nucleic Acids Res	2012	Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders affecting both humans and animals. The cellular prion protein, PrP(C), and the abnormal infectious form, PrP(Sc), are found associated with exosomes, which are small 50-130 nm vesicles released from cells. Exosomes also contain microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of non-coding RNA, and have been utilized to identify miRNA signatures for diagnosis of disease. While some miRNAs are deregulated in prion-infected brain tissue, the role of miRNA in circulating exosomes released during prion disease is unknown. Here, we investigated the miRNA profile in exosomes released from prion-infected neuronal cells. We performed the first small RNA deep sequencing study of exosomes and demonstrated that neuronal exosomes contain a diverse range of RNA species including retroviral RNA repeat regions, messenger RNA fragments, transfer RNA fragments, non-coding RNA, small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA, small cytoplasmic RNA, silencing RNA as well as known and novel candidate miRNA. Significantly, we show that exosomes released by prion-infected neuronal cells have increased let-7b, let-7i, miR-128a, miR-21, miR-222, miR-29b, miR-342-3p and miR-424 levels with decreased miR-146 a levels compared to non-infected exosomes. Overall, these results demonstrate that circulating exosomes released during prion infection have a distinct miRNA signature that can be utilized for diagnosis and understanding pathogenic mechanisms in prion disease.

Two distinct populations of exosomes are released from LIM1863 colon carcinoma cell-derived organoids.	Mol Cell Proteomics	2013	Exosomes are naturally occurring biological nanomembranous vesicles (∼40 to 100 nm) of endocytic origin that are released from diverse cell types into the extracellular space. They have pleiotropic functions such as antigen presentation and intercellular transfer of protein cargo, mRNA, microRNA, lipids, and oncogenic potential. Here we describe the isolation, via sequential immunocapture using anti-A33- and anti-EpCAM-coupled magnetic beads, of two distinct populations of exosomes released from organoids derived from human colon carcinoma cell line LIM1863. The exosome populations (A33-Exos and EpCAM-Exos) could not be distinguished via electron microscopy and contained stereotypical exosome markers such as TSG101, Alix, and HSP70. The salient finding of this study, revealed via gel-based LC-MS/MS, was the exclusive identification in EpCAM-Exos of the classical apical trafficking molecules CD63 (LAMP3), mucin 13 and the apical intestinal enzyme sucrase isomaltase and increased expression of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and the apically restricted pentaspan membrane glycoprotein prominin 1. In contrast, the A33-Exos preparation was enriched with basolateral trafficking molecules such as early endosome antigen 1, the Golgi membrane protein ADP-ribosylation factor, and clathrin. Our observations are consistent with EpCAM- and A33-Exos being released from the apical and basolateral surfaces, respectively, and the EpCAM-Exos proteome profile with widely published stereotypical exosomes. A proteome analysis of LIM1863-derived shed microvesicles (sMVs) was also performed in order to clearly distinguish A33- and EpCAM-Exos from sMVs. Intriguingly, several members of the MHC class I family of antigen presentation molecules were exclusively observed in A33-Exos, whereas neither MHC class I nor MHC class II molecules were observed via MS in EpCAM-Exos. Additionally, we report for the first time in any extracellular vesicle study the colocalization of EpCAM, claudin-7, and CD44 in EpCAM-Exos. Given that these molecules are known to complex together to promote tumor progression, further characterization of exosome subpopulations will enable a deeper understanding of their possible role in regulation of the tumor microenvironment.

Neoplasia	2013	Tumor exosomes educate selected host tissues toward a prometastatic phenotype. We demonstrated this for exosomes of the metastatic rat adenocarcinoma BSp73ASML (ASML), which modulate draining lymph nodes and lung tissue to support settlement of poorly metastatic BSp73ASML-CD44v4-v7 knockdown (ASML-CD44v(kd)) cells. Now, we profiled mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) of ASML(wt) and ASML-CD44v(kd) exosomes to define the pathway(s), whereby exosomes prepare the premetastatic niche. ASML exosomes, recovered in draining lymph nodes after subcutaneous injection, preferentially are taken up by lymph node stroma cells (LnStr) and lung fibroblasts (LuFb) that were chosen as exosome targets. ASML(wt) and ASML-CD44v(kd) exosomes contain a restricted mRNA and miRNA repertoire that differs significantly between the two lines and exosomes thereof due to CD44v6 influencing gene and miRNA transcription/posttranscriptional regulation. Exosomal mRNA and miRNA are recovered in target cells, where transferred miRNA significantly affected mRNA translation. Besides others, this was exemplified for abundant ASML(wt)-exosomal miR-494 and miR-542-3p, which target cadherin-17 (cdh17). Concomitantly, matrix metalloproteinase transcription, accompanying cdh17 down-regulation, was upregulated in LnStr transfected with miR-494 or miR-542-3p or co-cultured with tumor exosomes. Thus, tumor exosomes target non-transformed cells in premetastatic organs and modulate premetastatic organ cells predominantly through transferred miRNA, where miRNA from a metastasizing tumor prepares premetastatic organ stroma cells for tumor cell hosting. Fitting the demands of metastasizing tumor cells, transferred exosomal miRNA mostly affected proteases, adhesion molecules, chemokine ligands, cell cycle- and angiogenesis-promoting genes, and genes engaged in oxidative stress response. The demonstration of function-competent exosomal miRNA in host target cells encourages exploiting exosomes as a therapeutic gene delivery system.	PMC3593151

BMC Genomics	2013	BACKGROUND: Exosomes, endosome-derived membrane microvesicles, contain specific RNA transcripts that are thought to be involved in cell-cell communication. These RNA transcripts have great potential as disease biomarkers. To characterize exosomal RNA profiles systemically, we performed RNA sequencing analysis using three human plasma samples and evaluated the efficacies of small RNA library preparation protocols from three manufacturers. In all we evaluated 14 libraries (7 replicates). RESULTS: From the 14 size-selected sequencing libraries, we obtained a total of 101.8 million raw single-end reads, an average of about 7.27 million reads per library. Sequence analysis showed that there was a diverse collection of the exosomal RNA species among which microRNAs (miRNAs) were the most abundant, making up over 42.32% of all raw reads and 76.20% of all mappable reads. At the current read depth, 593 miRNAs were detectable. The five most common miRNAs (miR-99a-5p, miR-128, miR-124-3p, miR-22-3p, and miR-99b-5p) collectively accounted for 48.99% of all mappable miRNA sequences. MiRNA target gene enrichment analysis suggested that the highly abundant miRNAs may play an important role in biological functions such as protein phosphorylation, RNA splicing, chromosomal abnormality, and angiogenesis. From the unknown RNA sequences, we predicted 185 potential miRNA candidates. Furthermore, we detected significant fractions of other RNA species including ribosomal RNA (9.16% of all mappable counts), long non-coding RNA (3.36%), piwi-interacting RNA (1.31%), transfer RNA (1.24%), small nuclear RNA (0.18%), and small nucleolar RNA (0.01%); fragments of coding sequence (1.36%), 5' untranslated region (0.21%), and 3' untranslated region (0.54%) were also present. In addition to the RNA composition of the libraries, we found that the three tested commercial kits generated a sufficient number of DNA fragments for sequencing but each had significant bias toward capturing specific RNAs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that a wide variety of RNA species are embedded in the circulating vesicles. To our knowledge, this is the first report that applied deep sequencing to discover and characterize profiles of plasma-derived exosomal RNAs. Further characterization of these extracellular RNAs in diverse human populations will provide reference profiles and open new doors for the development of blood-based biomarkers for human diseases.

J Virol	2013	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human gammaherpesvirus, establishes a lifelong latent infection in B lymphocytes and epithelial cells following primary infection. Several lines of evidence suggest that exosomes derived from EBV-infected cells are internalized and transfer viral factors, including EBV-encoded latent membrane protein and microRNAs, to the recipient cells. However, the detailed mechanism by which exosomes are internalized and their physiological impact on the recipient cells are still poorly understood. In this study, we visualized the internalization of fluorescently labeled exosomes derived from EBV-uninfected and EBV-infected B cells of type I and type III latency into EBV-negative epithelial cells. In this way, we demonstrated that exosomes derived from all three cell types were internalized into the target cells in a similar fashion. Internalization of exosomes was significantly suppressed by treatment with an inhibitor of dynamin and also by the knockdown of caveolin-1. Labeled exosomes were colocalized with caveolae and subsequently trafficked through endocytic pathways. Moreover, we observed that exosomes derived from type III latency cells upregulated proliferation and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in the recipient cells more significantly than did those derived from EBV-negative and type I latency cells. We also identified the EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) gene as responsible for induction of ICAM-1 expression. Taken together, our data indicate that exosomes released from EBV-infected B cells are internalized via caveola-dependent endocytosis, which, in turn, contributes to phenotypic changes in the recipient cells through transferring one or more viral factors.

PLoS One	2013	Normal and malignant cells release a variety of different vesicles into their extracellular environment. The most prominent vesicles are the microvesicles (MVs, 100-1000 nm in diameter), which are shed of the plasma membrane, and the exosomes (70-120 nm in diameter), derivates of the endosomal system. MVs have been associated with intercellular communication processes and transport numerous proteins, lipids and RNAs. As essential component of immune-escape mechanisms tumor-derived MVs suppress immune responses. Additionally, tumor-derived MVs have been found to promote metastasis, tumor-stroma interactions and angiogenesis. Since members of the carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-family have been associated with similar processes, we studied the distribution and function of CEACAMs in MV fractions of different human epithelial tumor cells and of human and murine endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that in association to their cell surface phenotype, MVs released from different human epithelial tumor cells contain CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6, while human and murine endothelial cells were positive for CEACAM1 only. Furthermore, MVs derived from CEACAM1 transfected CHO cells carried CEACAM1. In terms of their secretion kinetics, we show that MVs are permanently released in low doses, which are extensively increased upon cellular starvation stress. Although CEACAM1 did not transmit signals into MVs it served as ligand for CEACAM expressing cell types. We gained evidence that CEACAM1-positive MVs significantly increase the CD3 and CD3/CD28-induced T-cell proliferation. All together, our data demonstrate that MV-bound forms of CEACAMs play important roles in intercellular communication processes, which can modulate immune response, tumor progression, metastasis and angiogenesis.

Clin Biochem	2014	OBJECTIVES: Exosomes are small membrane bound vesicles secreted by most cell types. Exosomes contain various functional proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) that could be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Currently, a standard method for serum exosome isolation is differential ultracentrifugation, but a search for alternative, less time-consuming and labour extensive exosomal isolation method for use in clinical settings is ongoing. The effect of serum exosome isolation method on obtained miRNA profile is not yet clear. The aim of this study was to determine to which extent selected exosome isolation methods influence the serum exosomal miRNA profile. DESIGN AND METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from blood serum of healthy individuals by ultracentrifugation and ExoQuick Precipitation methods. The expression profile of 375 miRNAs was determined by real time PCR using Exiqon miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Human panel I assays. RESULTS: Although a strong correlation of exosomal miRNA profiles was observed between the two isolation methods, distinct clusters of miRNA levels between the used methods were identified. The detected levels of two miRNAs, miR-92a and miR-486-5p, were significantly influenced by the exosome isolation method used. CONCLUSIONS: Both exosome isolation methods are suitable for serum exosomal miRNA profiling. Differences found in miRNA patterns between the two methods indicate that the observed exosomal miRNA profile is slightly affected by the extracellular vesicle isolation method.

Characterization and deep sequencing analysis of exosomal and non-exosomal miRNA in human urine.	Kidney Int	2014	Micro RNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to circulate in biological fluids and are enclosed in vesicles such as exosomes; they are present in urine and represent a noninvasive methodology to detect biomarkers for diagnostic testing. The low abundance of RNA in urine creates difficulties in its isolation, of which exosomal miRNA is a small fraction, making downstream RNA assays challenging. Here, we investigate methods to maximize exosomal isolation and RNA yield for next-generation deep sequencing. Upon characterizing exosomal proteins and total RNA content in urine, several commercially available kits were tested for their RNA extraction efficiency. We subsequently used the methods with the highest miRNA content to profile baseline miRNA expression using next-generation deep sequencing. Comparisons of miRNA profiles were also made with exosomes isolated by differential ultracentrifugation methodology and a commercially available column-based protocol. Overall, miRNAs were found to be significantly enriched and intact in urine-derived exosomes compared with cell-free urine. The presence of other noncoding RNAs such as small nuclear and small nucleolar RNA in the exosomes, in addition to coding sequences related to kidney and bladder conditions, was also detected. Our study extensively characterizes the RNA content of exosomes isolated from urine, providing the potential to identify miRNA biomarkers in human urine.

J Extracell Vesicles	2013	INTRODUCTION: Extracellular vesicles (EV) are phospholipid bilayer-enclosed vesicles recognized as new mediators in intercellular communication and potential biomarkers of disease. They are found in many body fluids and mainly studied in fractions isolated from blood plasma in view of their potential in medicine. Due to the limitations of available analytical methods, morphological information on EV in fresh plasma is still rather limited. OBJECTIVES: To image EV and determine the morphology, structure and size distribution in fresh plasma by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). METHODS: Fresh citrate- and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anticoagulated plasma or EV isolated from these plasmas were rapidly cryo-immobilized by vitrification and visualized by cryo-EM. RESULTS: EV isolated from fresh plasma were highly heterogeneous in morphology and size and mostly contain a discernible lipid bilayer (lipid vesicles). In fresh plasma there were 2 types of particles with a median diameter of 30 nm (25-260 nm). The majority of these particles are electron dense particles which most likely represent lipoproteins. The minority are lipid vesicles, either electron dense or electron lucent, which most likely represent EV. Lipid vesicles were occasionally observed in close proximity of platelets in citrate and EDTA-anticoagulated platelet-rich plasma. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) was employed to determine the 3D structure of platelet secretory granules. CONCLUSIONS: Cryo-EM is a powerful technique that enables the characterization of EV in fresh plasma revealing structural details and considerable morphological heterogeneity. Only a small proportion of the submicron structures in fresh plasma are lipid vesicles representing EV.	PMC3895263
24620748	Nathan R Wall	Department of Biochemistry, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA, USA. .	nwall@llu.edu		Early diagnostic value of survivin and its alternative splice variants in breast cancer.	BMC Cancer	2014	BACKGROUND: The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein Survivin and its splice variants are differentially expressed in breast cancer tissues. Our previous work showed Survivin is released from tumor cells via small membrane-bound vesicles called exosomes. We, therefore, hypothesize that analysis of serum exosomal Survivin and its splice variants may provide a novel biomarker for early diagnosis of breast cancer. METHODS: We collected sera from forty breast cancer patients and ten control patients who were disease free for 5 years after treatment. In addition, twenty-three paired breast cancer tumor tissues from those same 40 patients were analyzed for splice variants. Serum levels of Survivin were analyzed using ELISA and exosomes were isolated from this serum using the commercially available ExoQuick kit, with subsequent Western blots and immunohistochemistry performed. RESULTS: Survivin levels were significantly higher in all the breast cancer samples compared to controls (p < 0.05) with exosome amounts significantly higher in cancer patient sera compared to controls (p < 0.01). While Survivin and Survivin-∆Ex3 splice variant expression and localization was identical in serum exosomes, differential expression of Survivin-2B protein existed in the exosomes. Similarly, Survivin and Survivin-∆Ex3 proteins were the predominant forms detected in all of the breast cancer tissues evaluated in this study, whereas a more variable expression of Survivin-2B level was found at different cancer stages. CONCLUSION: In this study we show for the first time that like Survivin, the Survivin splice variants are also exosomally packaged in the breast cancer patients' sera, mimicking the survivin splice variant pattern that we also report in breast cancer tissues. Differential expression of exosomal-Survivin, particularly Survivin-2B, may serve as a diagnostic and/or prognostic marker, a "liquid biopsy" if you will, in early breast cancer patients. Furthermore, a more thorough understanding of the role of this prominent antiapoptotic pathway could lead to the development of potential therapeutics for breast cancer patients.	PMC3995700

Fertil Steril	2014	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether human blastocysts secrete microRNA (miRNAs) into culture media and whether these reflect embryonic ploidy status and can predict in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. DESIGN: Experimental study of human embryos and IVF culture media. SETTING: Academic IVF program. PATIENT(S): 91 donated, cryopreserved embryos that developed into 28 tested blastocysts, from 13 couples who had previously completed IVF cycles. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Relative miRNA expression in IVF culture media. RESULT(S): Blastocysts were assessed by chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization analysis, and the culture media from 55 single-embryo transfer cycles was tested for miRNA expression using an array-based quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. The expression of the identified miRNA was correlated with pregnancy outcomes. Ten miRNA were identified in the culture media; two were specific to spent media (miR-191 and miR-372), and one was only present in media before the embryos had been cultured (miR-645). MicroRNA-191 was more highly concentrated in media from aneuploid embryos, and miR-191, miR-372, and miR-645 were more highly concentrated in media from failed IVF/non-intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles. Additionally, miRNA were found to be more highly concentrated in ICSI and day-5 media samples when compared with regularly inseminated and day-4 samples, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): MicroRNA can be detected in IVF culture media. Some of these miRNA are differentially expressed according to the fertilization method, chromosomal status, and pregnancy outcome, which makes them potential biomarkers for predicting IVF success.

Human prominin-1 (CD133) is detected in both neoplastic and non-neoplastic salivary gland diseases and released into saliva in a ubiquitinated form.	PLoS One	2014	Prominin-1 (CD133) is physiologically expressed at the apical membranes of secretory (serous and mucous) and duct cells of major salivary glands. We investigated its expression in various human salivary gland lesions using two distinct anti-prominin-1 monoclonal antibodies (80B258 and AC133) applied on paraffin-embedded sections and characterized its occurrence in saliva. The 80B258 epitope was extensively expressed in adenoid cystic carcinoma, in lesser extent in acinic cell carcinoma and pleomorphic adenoma, and rarely in mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The 80B258 immunoreactivity was predominately detected at the apical membrane of tumor cells showing acinar or intercalated duct cell differentiation, which lined duct- or cyst-like structures, and in luminal secretions. It was observed on the whole cell membrane in non-luminal structures present in the vicinity of thin-walled blood vessels and hemorrhagic areas in adenoid cystic carcinoma. Of note, AC133 labeled only a subset of 80B258-positive structures. In peritumoral salivary gland tissues as well as in obstructive sialadenitis, an up-regulation of prominin-1 (both 80B258 and AC133 immunoreactivities) was observed in intercalated duct cells. In most tissues, prominin-1 was partially co-expressed with two cancer markers: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and mucin-1 (MUC1). Differential centrifugation of saliva followed by immunoblotting indicated that all three markers were released in association with small membrane vesicles. Immuno-isolated prominin-1-positive vesicles contained CEA and MUC1, but also exosome-related proteins CD63, flotillin-1, flotillin-2 and the adaptor protein syntenin-1. The latter protein was shown to interact with prominin-1 as demonstrated by its co-immunoisolation. A fraction of saliva-associated prominin-1 appeared to be ubiquitinated. Collectively, our findings bring new insights into the biochemistry and trafficking of prominin-1 as well as its immunohistochemical profile in certain types of salivary gland tumors and inflammatory diseases.

Plasma exosomal α-synuclein is likely CNS-derived and increased in Parkinson's disease.	Acta Neuropathol	2014	Extracellular α-synuclein is important in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and also as a potential biomarker when tested in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The performance of blood plasma or serum α-synuclein as a biomarker has been found to be inconsistent and generally ineffective, largely due to the contribution of peripherally derived α-synuclein. In this study, we discovered, via an intracerebroventricular injection of radiolabeled α-synuclein into mouse brain, that CSF α-synuclein was readily transported to blood, with a small portion being contained in exosomes that are relatively specific to the central nervous system (CNS). Consequently, we developed a technique to evaluate the levels of α-synuclein in these exosomes in individual plasma samples. When applied to a large cohort of clinical samples (267 PD, 215 controls), we found that in contrast to CSF α-synuclein concentrations, which are consistently reported to be lower in PD patients compared to controls, the levels of plasma exosomal α-synuclein were substantially higher in PD patients, suggesting an increased efflux of the protein to the peripheral blood of these patients. Furthermore, although no association was observed between plasma exosomal and CSF α-synuclein, a significant correlation between plasma exosomal α-synuclein and disease severity (r = 0.176, p = 0.004) was observed, and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity achieved by plasma exosomal α-synuclein were comparable to those determined by CSF α-synuclein. Further studies are clearly needed to elucidate the mechanism involved in the transport of CNS α-synuclein to the periphery, which may lead to a more convenient and robust assessment of PD clinically.

J Transl Med	2014	BACKGROUND: Human placenta releases specific nanovesicles (i.e. exosomes) into the maternal circulation during pregnancy, however, the presence of placenta-derived exosomes in maternal blood during early pregnancy remains to be established. The aim of this study was to characterise gestational age related changes in the concentration of placenta-derived exosomes during the first trimester of pregnancy (i.e. from 6 to 12 weeks) in plasma from women with normal pregnancies. METHODS: A time-series experimental design was used to establish pregnancy-associated changes in maternal plasma exosome concentrations during the first trimester. A series of plasma were collected from normal healthy women (10 patients) at 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 weeks of gestation (n = 70). We measured the stability of these vesicles by quantifying and observing their protein and miRNA contents after the freeze/thawing processes. Exosomes were isolated by differential and buoyant density centrifugation using a sucrose continuous gradient and characterised by their size distribution and morphology using the nanoparticles tracking analysis (NTA; Nanosight™) and electron microscopy (EM), respectively. The total number of exosomes and placenta-derived exosomes were determined by quantifying the immunoreactive exosomal marker, CD63 and a placenta-specific marker (Placental Alkaline Phosphatase PLAP). RESULTS: These nanoparticles are extraordinarily stable. There is no significant decline in their yield with the freeze/thawing processes or change in their EM morphology. NTA identified the presence of 50-150 nm spherical vesicles in maternal plasma as early as 6 weeks of pregnancy. The number of exosomes in maternal circulation increased significantly (ANOVA, p = 0.002) with the progression of pregnancy (from 6 to 12 weeks). The concentration of placenta-derived exosomes in maternal plasma (i.e. PLAP+) increased progressively with gestational age, from 6 weeks 70.6 ± 5.7 pg/ml to 12 weeks 117.5 ± 13.4 pg/ml. Regression analysis showed that weeks is a factor that explains for >70% of the observed variation in plasma exosomal PLAP concentration while the total exosome number only explains 20%. CONCLUSIONS: During normal healthy pregnancy, the number of exosomes present in the maternal plasma increased significantly with gestational age across the first trimester of pregnancy. This study is a baseline that provides an ideal starting point for developing early detection method for women who subsequently develop pregnancy complications, clinically detected during the second trimester. Early detection of women at risk of pregnancy complications would provide an opportunity to develop and evaluate appropriate intervention strategies to limit acute adverse sequel.	PMC4283151

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2014	Development of effective strategies to mobilize the immune system as a therapeutic modality in cancer necessitates a better understanding of the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to the complex interplay between cancer cells and the immune response. Recently, effort has been directed at unraveling the functional role of exosomes and their cargo of messengers in this interplay. Exosomes are small vesicles (30-200 nm) that mediate local and long-range communication through the horizontal transfer of information, such as combinations of proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs. Here, we develop a tractable theoretical framework to study the putative role of exosome-mediated cell-cell communication in the cancer-immunity interplay. We reduce the complex interplay into a generic model whose three components are cancer cells, dendritic cells (consisting of precursor, immature, and mature types), and killer cells (consisting of cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, effector B cells, and natural killer cells). The framework also incorporates the effects of exosome exchange on enhancement/reduction of cell maturation, proliferation, apoptosis, immune recognition, and activation/inhibition. We reveal tristability-possible existence of three cancer states: a low cancer load with intermediate immune level state, an intermediate cancer load with high immune level state, and a high cancer load with low immune-level state, and establish the corresponding effective landscape for the cancer-immunity network. We illustrate how the framework can contribute to the design and assessments of combination therapies.	PMC4210007

Therapeutic potential of human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) from cancer patients: a pilot study.	PLoS One	2014	Mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue (ADSCs) are an important source of cells for regenerative medicine. The therapeutic effect of culture-expanded adipose derived stem cells has been shown; however, optimal xeno-free culture conditions remain to be determined. Cancer patients, specifically those undergoing invasive surgery, constitute a subgroup of patients who could benefit from autologous stem cell transplantation. Although regenerative potential of their ADSCs could be affected by the disease and/or treatment, we are not aware of any study that has evaluated the therapeutic potential of ADSCs isolated from cancer patients in reference to that of ADSCs derived from healthy subjects. Here we report that ADSCs isolated from subabdominal adipose tissue of patients with urological neoplasms yielded similar growth kinetics, presented equivalent mesenchymal surface markers and showed similar differentiation potential into distinct mesodermal cell lineages: adipocytes, chondroblasts and osteoblasts than ADSCs isolated from adipose tissue of age-matched non-oncogenic participants, all under xeno-free growth culture conditions. Molecular karyotyping of patient expanded ADSCs genomes showed no disease-related alterations indicating their safety. In addition, vesicles <100 nm identified as exosomes (EXOs) which may be at least partly responsible for the attributed therapeutic paracrine effects of the ADSCs were effectively isolated from ADSCs and showed equivalent miRNA content regardless they were derived from cancer patients or non-oncogenic participants indicating that the repair capabilities of xeno-free expanded ADSCs are not compromised by patient condition and therefore their xeno-free culture expanded ADSCs should be suitable for autologous stem cell transplantation in a clinical setting.

Electronic address: .	stan@florey.edu.au		PTEN secretion in exosomes.	Methods	2015	PTEN was discovered as a membrane-associated tumor suppressor protein nearly two decades ago, but the concept that it can be secreted and taken up by recipient cells is revolutionary. Since then, various laboratories have reported that PTEN is indeed secreted and available for uptake by other cells in at least two different guises. First, PTEN may be packaged and exported within extracellular vesicles (EV) called exosomes. Second, PTEN may also be secreted as a naked protein in a longer isoform called PTEN-long. While the conditions favouring the secretion of PTEN-long remain unknown, PTEN secretion in exosomes is enhanced by the Ndfip1/Nedd4 ubiquitination system. In this report, we describe conditions for packaging PTEN in exosomes and their potential use for mediating non cell-autonomous functions in recipient cells. We suggest that this mode of PTEN transfer may potentially provide beneficial PTEN for tumor suppression, however it may also propagate deleterious versions of mutated PTEN causing tumorigenesis.

Extracellular vesicles from bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells transport tumor regulatory microRNA, proteins, and metabolites.	Oncotarget	2015	Human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) have been shown to support breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, partly through their secretome. hMSCs have a remarkable ability to survive for long periods under stress, and their secretome is tumor supportive. In this study, we have characterized the cargo of extracellular vesicular (EV) fraction (that is in the size range of 40-150nm) of serum deprived hMSCs (SD-MSCs). Next Generation Sequencing assays were used to identify small RNA secreted in the EVs, which indicated presence of tumor supportive miRNA. Further assays demonstrated the role of miRNA-21 and 34a as tumor supportive miRNAs. Next, proteomic assays revealed the presence of ≈150 different proteins, most of which are known tumor supportive factors such as PDGFR-β, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2. Lipidomic assays verified presence of bioactive lipids such as sphingomyelin. Furthermore, metabolite assays identified the presence of lactic acid and glutamic acid in EVs. The co-injection xenograft assays using MCF-7 breast cancer cells demonstrated the tumor supportive function of these EVs. To our knowledge this is the first comprehensive -omics based study that characterized the complex cargo of extracellular vesicles secreted by hMSCs and their role in supporting breast cancers.

Virology	2015	Exosomes are membranous extracellular nanovesicles secreted by diverse cell types. Exosomes from healthy human semen have been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication and to impair progeny virus infectivity. In this study, we examined the ability of healthy human semen exosomes to restrict HIV-1 and LP-BM5 murine AIDS virus transmission in three different model systems. We show that vaginal cells internalize exosomes with concomitant transfer of functional mRNA. Semen exosomes blocked the spread of HIV-1 from vaginal epithelial cells to target cells in our cell-to-cell infection model and suppressed transmission of HIV-1 across the vaginal epithelial barrier in our trans-well model. Our in vivo model shows that human semen exosomes restrict intravaginal transmission and propagation of murine AIDS virus. Our study highlights an antiretroviral role for semen exosomes that may be harnessed for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat HIV-1 transmission.	PMC4461544

Integrin β4 and vinculin contained in exosomes are potential markers for progression of prostate cancer associated with taxane-resistance.	Int J Oncol	2015	Treatment with taxanes for castration-resistant prostate cancer often leads to the development of resistance. It has been recently demonstrated that exosomes present in the body fluids contain proteins and RNAs in the cells from which they are derived and could serve as a diagnostic marker for various diseases. In the present study, we aimed to identify proteins contained in exosomes that could be markers for progression and taxane-resistance of prostate cancer. Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation from the culture medium of taxane-resistant human prostate cancer PC-3 cells (PC-3R) and their parental PC-3 cells. Isolated exosomes were subjected to iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis. Exosomes were also isolated from the culture medium by using anti-CD9 antibody-conjugated magnetic beads. Protein expression was knocked down by siRNA transfection followed by analysis of the silencing effects. Proteomic analysis showed that integrin β4 (ITGB4) and vinculin (VCL) were upregulated in exosomes derived from PC-3R cells compared to PC-3 cells. The elevation of ITGB4 and VCL was confirmed in exosomes captured by anti-CD9 antibody from the culture medium of PC-3R cells. Silencing of ITGB4 and VCL expression did not affect proliferation and taxane-resistance of PC-3R cells, but ITGB4 knockdown attenuated both cell migration and invasion and VCL knockdown reduced invasion. Our results suggest that ITGB4 and VCL in exosomes could be useful markers for progression of prostate cancer associated with taxane-resistance, providing the basis for development of an exosome-based diagnostic system.

Ionizing radiation affects protein composition of exosomes secreted in vitro from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.	Acta Biochim Pol	2015	Exosomes are membrane vesicles of endocytic origin that participate in inter-cellular communication. Environmental and physiological conditions affect composition of secreted exosomes, their abundance and potential influence on recipient cells. Here, we analyzed protein component of exosomes released in vitro from cells exposed to ionizing radiation (2Gy dose) and compared their content with composition of exosomes released from control not irradiated cells. Exosomes secreted from FaDu cells originating from human squamous head and neck cell carcinoma were analyzed using LC-MS/MS approach. We have found that exposure to ionizing radiation resulted in gross changes in exosomal cargo. There were 217 proteins identified in exosomes from control cells and 384 proteins identified in exosomes from irradiated cells, including 148 "common" proteins, 236 proteins detected specifically after irradiation and 69 proteins not detected after irradiation. Among proteins specifically overrepresented in exosomes from irradiated cells were those involved in transcription, translation, protein turnover, cell division and cell signaling. This indicated that exosomal cargo reflected radiation-induced changes in cellular processes like transient suppression of transcription and translation or stress-induced signaling.

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	Extracellular vesicles represent a rich source of novel biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of disease. However, there is currently limited information elucidating the most efficient methods for obtaining high yields of pure exosomes, a subset of extracellular vesicles, from cell culture supernatant and complex biological fluids such as plasma. To this end, we comprehensively characterize a variety of exosome isolation protocols for their efficiency, yield and purity of isolated exosomes. Repeated ultracentrifugation steps can reduce the quality of exosome preparations leading to lower exosome yield. We show that concentration of cell culture conditioned media using ultrafiltration devices results in increased vesicle isolation when compared to traditional ultracentrifugation protocols. However, our data on using conditioned media isolated from the Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) SK-MES-1 cell line demonstrates that the choice of concentrating device can greatly impact the yield of isolated exosomes. We find that centrifuge-based concentrating methods are more appropriate than pressure-driven concentrating devices and allow the rapid isolation of exosomes from both NSCLC cell culture conditioned media and complex biological fluids. In fact to date, no protocol detailing exosome isolation utilizing current commercial methods from both cells and patient samples has been described. Utilizing tunable resistive pulse sensing and protein analysis, we provide a comparative analysis of 4 exosome isolation techniques, indicating their efficacy and preparation purity. Our results demonstrate that current precipitation protocols for the isolation of exosomes from cell culture conditioned media and plasma provide the least pure preparations of exosomes, whereas size exclusion isolation is comparable to density gradient purification of exosomes. We have identified current shortcomings in common extracellular vesicle isolation methods and provide a potential standardized method that is effective, reproducible and can be utilized for various starting materials. We believe this method will have extensive application in the growing field of extracellular vesicle research.	PMC4507751

The Uptake of Extracellular Vesicles is Affected by the Differentiation Status of Myeloid Cells.	Scand J Immunol	2015	Intercellular communication includes the exchange of various membrane vesicles including exosomes. Exosomes are intraluminal nanovesicles generated from multivesicular bodies, a late endosomal compartment. Cancer cells release exosomes that influence their proximate and distant environment to facilitate angiogenesis, metastatic dissemination and immune escape. Cancer-derived vesicles may also trigger an anti-tumour response by transferring tumour antigens to immune cells. We wanted to investigate whether differentiation and maturation of myeloid cells changes their capacity to take up cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EV). We compared the efficiency of vesicle uptake by monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. To visualize and quantify the cellular uptake, EV were labelled with two different dyes, carboxyfluoresceine diacetate succinimidyl-ester (CFSE), or DSSN+, a water soluble distyrylstilbene oligoelectrolyte which preferentially intercalates into the cell membrane. With the help of cytokines, THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into immature or mature dendritic cells, or macrophages. EV uptake was monitored by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. The results show that macrophages and mature dendritic cells acquired stronger fluorescence transferred by EV than monocytes or immature dendritic cells indicating that the differentiation status influences the efficiency of EV uptake.

Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells release Fas ligand in exosomal fractions and induce apoptosis in recipient cells via the extrinsic pathway.	J Gen Virol	2015	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; human herpesvirus 4) is an oncogenic herpesvirus implicated in the pathogenesis of several human malignancies. A number of recent studies indicate that EBV can manipulate the local microenvironment by excreting viral and cellular components in nanovesicles called exosomes. In this study, we investigated the impact of EBV-derived exosomes on apoptosis of recipient cells and the molecular pathway involved in this process. Exosomes from EBV-infected but not from non-infected cells induced apoptosis in a number of different cell types, including B-cells, T-cells and epithelial cells. However, this phenomenon was not universal and the Burkitt's lymphoma-derived B-cell line BJAB was found to be resistant to apoptosis. Exosomes from both type I and type III EBV latently infected cells induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, cells exposed to EBV exosomes did not form colonies in soft agar assays. We further show that fluorescently labelled exosomes derived from EBV-infected cells are taken up by non-infected cells and induce apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway. Inhibition of caspase-3/7/8 blocks EBV exosome-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, our data indicate that EBV exosomes trigger apoptosis through the Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated extrinsic pathway, as FasL was present in EBV exosomal fractions and anti-FasL antibodies could block EBV exosome-mediated apoptosis. Together, these data support the notion that EBV hijacks the exosome pathway to excrete viral and cellular components that can modulate its microenvironment.

High LIN28A Expressing Ovarian Cancer Cells Secrete Exosomes That Induce Invasion and Migration in HEK293 Cells.	Biomed Res Int	2015	Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most aggressive and deadly form of ovarian cancer and is the most lethal gynecological malignancy worldwide; therefore, efforts to elucidate the molecular factors that lead to epithelial ovarian cancer are essential to better understand this disease. Recent studies reveal that tumor cells release cell-secreted vesicles called exosomes and these exosomes can transfer RNAs and miRNAs to distant sites, leading to cell transformation and tumor development. The RNA-binding protein LIN28 is a known marker of stem cells and when expressed in cancer, it is associated with poor tumor outcome. We hypothesized that high LIN28 expressing ovarian cancer cells secrete exosomes that can be taken up by nontumor cells and cause changes in gene expression and cell behavior associated with tumor development. IGROV1 cells were found to contain high LIN28A and secrete exosomes that were taken up by HEK293 cells. Moreover, exposure to these IGROV1 secreted exosomes led to significant increases in genes involved in Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), induced HEK293 cell invasion and migration. These changes were not observed with exosomes secreted by OV420 cells, which contain no detectable amounts of LIN28A or LIN28B. No evidence was found of LIN28A transfer from IGROV1 exosomes to HEK293 cells.	PMC4637063

Exosomes from bulk and stem cells from human prostate cancer have a differential microRNA content that contributes cooperatively over local and pre-metastatic niche.	Oncotarget	2016	The different prostate cancer (PCa) cell populations (bulk and cancer stem cells, CSCs) release exosomes that contain miRNAs that could modify the local or premetastatic niche. The analysis of the differential expression of miRNAs in exosomes allows evaluating the differential biological effect of both populations on the niche, and the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Five PCa primary cell cultures were established to originate bulk and CSCs cultures. From them, exosomes were purified by precipitation for miRNAs extraction to perform a comparative profile of miRNAs by next generation sequencing in an Illumina platform. 1839 miRNAs were identified in the exosomes. Of these 990 were known miRNAs, from which only 19 were significantly differentially expressed: 6 were overexpressed in CSCs and 13 in bulk cells exosomes. miR-100-5p and miR-21-5p were the most abundant miRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that differentially expressed miRNAs are highly related with PCa carcinogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and migration, and angiogenesis. Besides, miRNAs from bulk cells affects osteoblast differentiation. Later, their effect was evaluated in normal prostate fibroblasts (WPMY-1) where transfection with miR-100-5p, miR-21-5p and miR-139-5p increased the expression of metalloproteinases (MMPs) -2, -9 and -13 and RANKL and fibroblast migration. The higher effect was achieved with miR21 transfection. As conclusion, miRNAs have a differential pattern between PCa bulk and CSCs exosomes that act collaboratively in PCa progression and metastasis. The most abundant miRNAs in PCa exosomes are interesting potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.	PMC4826185

Exosomal microRNA-141 is upregulated in the serum of prostate cancer patients.	Onco Targets Ther	2016	PURPOSE: Novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) are urgently required. Increasing evidence suggests that exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) in serum may be potential noninvasive biomarkers for certain diseases. The objective of the present study was to investigate and assess whether exosomal miR-141 is an effective biomarker for human PCa. METHODS: In the present study, exosomes were isolated from the serum of patients with PCa, patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), and healthy volunteers. The total RNA was extracted from the exosomes and the level of miR-141 was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of miR-141 were compared between the whole serum and the serum exosomes of the three groups. Subsequently, the relevance of the exosomal expression of miR-141 to the clinicopathological factors in PCa was investigated. RESULTS: The expression of miR-141 was higher in exosomes compared with whole serum (control group, P=0.0003; BPH group, P=0.0016; PCa group, P<0.0001). The level of serum exosomal miR-141 was significantly higher in the patients with PCa compared with the patients with BPH and the healthy controls (3.85-fold, P=0.0007 and 4.06-fold, P=0.0005, respectively). In addition, the expression levels were significantly higher in metastatic PCa compared with localized PCa (P<0.0001). Receiver-operating characteristic curve revealed that the serum exosomal miR-141 yielded an area under the curve of 0.8694, with 80% sensitivity and 87.1% specificity in discriminating patients with metastatic PCa from the patients with localized PCa. CONCLUSION: Serum exosomes may serve as a more suitable material compared with the whole serum for measuring circulating miR-141 levels in patients with PCa. Exosomal miR-141 is upregulated in the serum from patients with PCa compared with patients with BPH or the healthy volunteers, and it may be a useful potential biomarker for the diagnosis of metastatic PCa.

J Leukoc Biol	2016	Interleukin-36 is a family of novel interleukin-1-like proinflammatory cytokines that are highly expressed in epithelial tissues and several myeloid-derived cell types. Like those of classic interleukin-1 cytokines, the secretion mechanisms of interleukin-36 are not well understood. Interleukin-36γ secretion in dermal epithelial cells requires adenosine 5'-triphosphate, which suggests a nonclassical mechanism of secretion. In this study, murine pulmonary macrophages and human alveolar macrophages were treated with recombinant pathogen-associated molecular patterns (intact bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae). Cell lysates were analyzed for messenger ribonucleic acid by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and conditioned medium was analyzed for interleukin-36γ by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with or without sonication. In addition, conditioned medium was ultracentrifuged at 25,000 g and 100,000 g, to isolate microparticles and exosomes, respectively, and interleukin-36γ protein was assessed in each fraction by Western blot analysis. Interleukin-36γ mRNA was induced in both murine and human lung macrophages by a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, as well as heat-killed and live Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and induction occurred in a myeloid differentiation response gene 88-dependent manner. Secretion of interleukin-36γ protein was enhanced by adenosine 5'-triphosphate. Furthermore, extracellular interleukin-36γ protein detection was markedly enhanced by sonication to disrupt membrane-bound structures. Interleukin-36γ protein was detected by Western blot in microparticles and exosome fractions isolated by ultracentrifugation. Interleukin-36γ was induced and secreted from lung macrophages in response to Gram-negative and -positive bacterial stimulation. The results suggest that interleukin-36γ is secreted in a non-Golgi-dependent manner by lung macrophages in response to Gram-positive and -negative bacterial challenge.	PMC4945350

Toxicol Sci	2016	Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a significant clinical and economic problem in the United States, yet the mechanisms that underlie DILI remain poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules released by stressed hepatocytes can trigger immune responses that may be common across DILI mechanisms. Extracellular vesicles released by hepatocytes, principally hepatocyte-derived exosomes (HDEs), may constitute one such signal. To examine HDE alterations as a function of drug-induced stress, this work utilized prototypical hepatotoxicant acetaminophen (APAP) in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, SD rat hepatocytes, and primary human hepatocytes. HDE were isolated using ExoQuick precipitation reagent and analyzed by quantification of the liver-specific RNAs albumin and microRNA-122 (miR-122). In vivo, significant elevations in circulating exosomal albumin mRNA were observed at subtoxic APAP exposures. Significant increases in exosomal albumin mRNA were also observed in primary rat hepatocytes at subtoxic APAP concentrations. In primary human hepatocytes, APAP elicited increases in both exosomal albumin mRNA and exosomal miR-122 without overt cytotoxicity. However, the number of HDE produced in vitro in response to APAP did not increase with exosomal RNA quantity. We conclude that significant drug-induced alterations in the liver-specific RNA content of HDE occur at subtoxic APAP exposures in vivo and in vitro, and that these changes appear to reflect selective packaging rather than changes in exosome number. The current findings demonstrate that translationally relevant HDE alterations occur in the absence of overt hepatocellular toxicity, and support the hypothesis that HDE released by stressed hepatocytes may mediate early immune responses in DILI.

Optimizing preservation of extracellular vesicular miRNAs derived from clinical cerebrospinal fluid.	Cancer Biomark	2016	BACKGROUND: Tumor specific genetic material can be detected in extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and other biofluids of glioblastoma patients. As such, EVs have emerged as a promising platform for biomarker discovery. However, the optimal procedure to transport clinical EV samples remains poorly characterized. METHODS: We examined the stability of EVs isolated from CSF of glioblastoma patients that were stored under different conditions. EV recovery was determined by Nanoparticle tracking analysis, and qRT-PCR was performed to determine the levels of miRNAs. RESULTS: CSF EVs that were lyophilized and stored at room temperature (RT) for seven days exhibited a 37-43% reduction in EV number. This reduction was further associated with decreased abundance of representative miRNAs. In contrast, the EV number and morphology remained largely unchanged if CSF were stored at RT. Total RNA and representative miRNA levels were well-preserved under this condition for up to seven days. A single cycle of freezing and thawing did not significantly alter EV number, morphology, RNA content, or miRNA levels. However, incremental decreases in these parameters were observed after two cycles of freezing and thawing. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that EVs in CSF are stable at RT for at least seven days. Repeated cycles of freezing/thawing should be avoided to minimize experimental artifacts.	PMC4992418

Mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles rescue radiation damage to murine marrow hematopoietic cells.	Leukemia	2016	Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to reverse radiation damage to marrow stem cells. We have evaluated the capacity of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) to mitigate radiation injury to marrow stem cells at 4 h to 7 days after irradiation. Significant restoration of marrow stem cell engraftment at 4, 24 and 168 h post irradiation by exposure to MSC-EVs was observed at 3 weeks to 9 months after transplant and further confirmed by secondary engraftment. Intravenous injection of MSC-EVs to 500cGy exposed mice led to partial recovery of peripheral blood counts and restoration of the engraftment of marrow. The murine hematopoietic cell line, FDC-P1 exposed to 500cGy, showed reversal of growth inhibition, DNA damage and apoptosis on exposure to murine or human MSC-EVs. Both murine and human MSC-EVs reverse radiation damage to murine marrow cells and stimulate normal murine marrow stem cell/progenitors to proliferate. A preparation with both exosomes and microvesicles was found to be superior to either microvesicles or exosomes alone. Biologic activity was seen in freshly isolated vesicles and in vesicles stored for up to 6 months in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide at -80 °C. These studies indicate that MSC-EVs can reverse radiation damage to bone marrow stem cells.	PMC5093052

J Transl Med	2016	BACKGROUND: Uterine aspirates are used in the diagnostic process of endometrial disorders, yet further applications could emerge if its complex milieu was simplified. Exosome-like vesicles isolated from uterine aspirates could become an attractive source of biomarkers, but there is a need to standardize isolation protocols. The objective of the study was to determine whether exosome-like vesicles exist in the fluid fraction of uterine aspirates and to compare protocols for their isolation, characterization, and analysis. METHODS: We collected uterine aspirates from 39 pre-menopausal women suffering from benign gynecological diseases. The fluid fraction of 27 of those aspirates were pooled and split into equal volumes to evaluate three differential centrifugation-based procedures: (1) a standard protocol, (2) a filtration protocol, and (3) a sucrose cushion protocol. Characterization of isolated vesicles was assessed by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and immunoblot. Specifically for RNA material, we evaluate the effect of sonication and RNase A treatment at different steps of the protocol. We finally confirmed the efficiency of the selected methods in non-pooled samples. RESULTS: All protocols were useful to isolate exosome-like vesicles. However, the Standard procedure was the best performing protocol to isolate exosome-like vesicles from uterine aspirates: nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed a higher concentration of vesicles with a mode of 135 ± 5 nm, and immunoblot showed a higher expression of exosome-related markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81) thus verifying an enrichment in this type of vesicles. RNA contained in exosome-like vesicles was successfully extracted with no sonication treatment and exogenous nucleic acids digestion with RNaseA, allowing the analysis of the specific inner cargo by Real-Time qPCR. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the existence of exosome-like vesicles in the fluid fraction of uterine aspirates. They were successfully isolated by differential centrifugation giving sufficient proteomic and transcriptomic material for further analyses. The Standard protocol was the best performing procedure since the other two tested protocols did not ameliorate neither yield nor purity of exosome-like vesicles. This study contributes to establishing the basis for future comparative studies to foster the field of biomarker research in gynecology.	PMC4912787

Exosomes from human colorectal cancer induce a tumor-like behavior in colonic mesenchymal stromal cells.	Oncotarget	2016	BACKGROUND: Cancer cells, including colorectal cancer ones (CRC), release high amounts of nanovesicles (exosomes), delivering biochemical messages for paracrine or systemic crosstalk. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to play contradicting roles in tumor progression. RESULTS: CRC exosomes induce in cMSCs: i) atypical morphology, higher proliferation, migration and invasion; ii) formation of spheroids; iii) an acidic extracellular environment associated with iv) a plasma membrane redistribution of vacuolar H+-ATPase and increased expression of CEA. Colon cancer derived MSCs, which were isolated from tumor masses, produce umbilicated spheroids, a future frequently observed in the inner core of rapidly growing tumors and recapitulate the changes observed in normal colonic MSCs exposed to CRC exosomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue specific colonic (c)MSCs were exposed to primary or metastatic CRC exosomes and analysed by light and electron microscopy, proliferation in 2D and 3D cultures, migration and invasion assays, Western blot and confocal microscopy for vacuolar H+-ATPase expression. CONCLUSIONS: CRC exosomes are able to induce morphological and functional changes in colonic MSCs, which may favour tumor growth and its malignant progression. Our results suggest that exosomes are actively involved in cancer progression and that inhibiting tumor exosome release may represent a way to interfere with cancer.	PMC5226570

Comparative Proteomic Analysis of Extracellular Vesicles Isolated by Acoustic Trapping or Differential Centrifugation.	Anal Chem	2016	Extracellular vesicles (ECVs), including microparticles and exosomes, are submicrometer membrane vesicles released by diverse cell types upon activation or stress. Circulating ECVs are potential reservoirs of disease biomarkers, and the complexity of these vesicles is significantly lower compared to their source, blood plasma, which makes ECV-based biomarker studies more promising. Proteomic profiling of ECVs is important not only to discover new diagnostic or prognostic markers but also to understand their roles in biological function. In the current study, we investigated the protein composition of plasma-derived ECVs isolated by acoustic seed trapping. Additionally, the protein composition of ECVs isolated with acoustic trapping was compared to that isolated with a conventional differential centrifugation protocol. Finally, the proteome of ECVs originating from ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients was compared with that of healthy controls using label-free LC-MS quantification. The acoustic trapping platform allows rapid and automated preparation of ECVs from small sample volumes, which are therefore well-suited for biobank repositories. We found that the protein composition of trapped ECVs is very similar to that isolated by the conventional differential centrifugation method.

Electronic address: .	dgozal@uchicago.edu		Tumor Cell Malignant Properties Are Enhanced by Circulating Exosomes in Sleep Apnea.	Chest	2016	BACKGROUND: OSA is associated with increased cancer incidence and mortality. Exosomes are vesicles secreted by most cells. They are released into the bloodstream and play a role in tumor progression and metastasis. We evaluated whether the chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) that characterizes OSA leads to release of tumor-promoting exosomes in the circulation. METHODS: C57/B6 male mice were randomized to 6 weeks of IH or room air (RA). A subgroup was injected with TC1 lung carcinoma cells in the left flank after 2 weeks of IH. Exosomes from mouse plasma and from 10 adult human patients with OSA before and after treatment for 6 weeks were cocultured with mouse TC1 and human adenocarcinoma cells lines. Malignant tumor properties such as proliferation, migration, invasion, and endothelial monolayer disruption were assessed, as was micro-RNA (miRNA), exosomal content, and transcriptomic effects of exosomes on TC1 cells in vitro to identify target genes. RESULTS: Application of IH-induced exosomes from either IH-exposed tumor-bearing (IH+) or non-tumor-bearing (IH-) mice significantly promoted TC1 malignant properties. Similarly, before adherent treatment, exosomes from patients with OSA significantly enhanced proliferation and migration of human adenocarcinoma cells compared with after adherent treatment. Eleven distinct miRNAs emerged in IH-exposed mice, and their gene targets in TC1 cells were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating exosomes released under IH conditions in vivo selectively enhance specific properties of lung tumor cell cultures. Thus, plasma exosomes participate in the increased tumor aggressiveness observed in patients with OSA.

FASEB J	2017	Membrane fusions that occur during vesicle transport, virus infection, and tissue development, involve receptors that mediate membrane contact and initiate fusion and effectors that execute membrane reorganization and fusion pore formation. Some of these fusogenic receptors/effectors are preferentially recruited to lipid raft membrane microdomains. Therefore, major constituents of lipid rafts, such as stomatin, may be involved in the regulation of cell-cell fusion. Stomatin produced in cells can be released to the extracellular environment, either through protein refolding to pass across lipid bilayer or through exosome trafficking. We report that cells expressing more stomatin or exposed to exogenous stomatin are more prone to undergoing cell fusion. During osteoclastogenesis, depletion of stomatin inhibited cell fusion but had little effect on tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase production. Moreover, in stomatin transgenic mice, increased cell fusion leading to enhanced bone resorption and subsequent osteoporosis were observed. With its unique molecular topology, stomatin forms molecular assembly within lipid rafts or on the appositional plasma membranes, and promotes membrane fusion by modulating fusogenic protein engagement.-Lee, J.-H., Hsieh, C.-F., Liu, H.-W., Chen, C.-Y., Wu, S.-C., Chen, T.-W., Hsu, C.-S., Liao, Y.-H., Yang, C.-Y., Shyu, J.-F., Fischer, W.

Expression of the fusogenic p14 FAST protein from a replication-defective adenovirus vector does not provide a therapeutic benefit in an immunocompetent mouse model of cancer.	Cancer Gene Ther	2016	When injected directly into a tumor mass, adenovirus (Ad) vectors only transduce cells immediately along the injection tract. Expression of fusogenic proteins from the Ad vector can lead to syncytium formation, which efficiently spreads the therapeutic effect. Fusogenic proteins can also cause cancer cell death directly, and enhance the release of exosome-like particles containing tumor-associated antigens, which boosts the anti-tumor immune response. In this study, we have examined whether delivery of an early region 1 (E1)-deleted, replication-defective Ad vector encoding the reptilian reovirus p14 fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein can provide therapeutic efficacy in an immunocompetent mouse tumor model. A high multiplicity of infection of AdFAST is required to induce cell fusion in mouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 cells in vitro, and FAST protein expression caused a modest reduction in cell membrane integrity and metabolic activity compared with cells infected with a control vector. Cells expressing FAST protein released significantly higher quantities of exosomes. In immunocompetent Balb/C mice harboring subcutaneous 4T1 tumors, AdFAST did not induce detectable cancer cell fusion, promote tumor regression or prolong mouse survival compared with untreated mice. This study suggests that in the context of the 4T1 model, Ad-mediated FAST protein expression did not elicit a therapeutic effect.	PMC5095592

Arthritis Res Ther	2016	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are involved in intercellular communication. The aim of this study was to investigate whether circulating exosomes effectively contribute to the inflammatory response in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Exosomes were purified from SLE patients and healthy controls (HCs). Healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with exosomes isolated from SLE patients and HCs in the presence or absence of Toll-like receptor (TLR) inhibitors. Production of interferon (IFN)-α, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 were measured. Correlation between exosome levels and SLE disease activity was examined. RESULTS: The serum exosomes levels were significantly higher in SLE patients than in HCs. SLE exosomes induced a higher production of IFN-α, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 compared to healthy exosomes. SLE serum that was depleted of exosomes and SLE exosomes that were mechanically disrupted failed to induce any significant cytokine production. Exosome-mediated production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 was decreased by the TLR4 antagonist, whereas that of IFN-α was suppressed by the TLR1/2, TLR7, and TLR9 antagonists. Exosome levels correlated with disease activity in SLE patients (rho = 0.846, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: The circulating exosomes are immunologically active and their levels correlate with disease activity in SLE patients. The circulating exosomes might serve as novel biomarkers of SLE disease activity.	PMC5112700

Cancers (Basel)	2016	The generation and release of membrane-enclosed packets from cancer cells, called extracellular vesicles (EVs), play important roles in propagating transformed phenotypes, including promoting cell survival. EVs mediate their effects by transferring their contents, which include specific proteins and nucleic acids, to target cells. However, how the cargo and function of EVs change in response to different stimuli remains unclear. Here, we discovered that treating highly aggressive MDAMB231 breast cancer cells with paclitaxel (PTX), a chemotherapy that stabilizes microtubules, causes them to generate a specific class of EV, namely exosomes, that are highly enriched with the cell survival protein and cancer marker, Survivin. Treating MDAMB231 cells with a variety of other chemotherapeutic agents, and inhibitors that block cell growth and survival, did not have the same effect as PTX, with the exception of nocodazole, another inhibitor of microtubule dynamics. Exosomes isolated from PTX-treated MDAMB231 cells strongly promoted the survival of serum-starved and PTX-treated fibroblasts and SKBR3 breast cancer cells, an effect that was ablated when Survivin was knocked-down from these vesicles using siRNA. These findings underscore how the enrichment of a specific cargo in exosomes promotes cell survival, as well as can potentially serve as a marker of PTX resistance.	PMC5187509

Association of ficolin-3 with abdominal aortic aneurysm presence and progression.	J Thromb Haemost	2017	Essentials Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is asymptomatic and its evolution unpredictable. To find novel potential biomarkers of AAA, microvesicles are an excellent source of biomarkers. Ficolin-3 is increased in microvesicles obtained from activated platelets and AAA tissue. Increased ficolin-3 plasma levels are associated with AAA presence and progression. SUMMARY: Background Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients are usually asymptomatic and AAA evolution is unpredictable. Ficolin-3, mainly synthesized by the liver, is a molecule of the lectin complement-activation pathway involved in AAA pathophysiology. Objectives To define extra-hepatic sources of ficolin-3 in AAA and investigate the role of ficolin-3 as a biomarker of the presence and progression of AAA. Methods Microvesicles (exosomes and microparticles) were isolated from culture-conditioned medium of ADP-activated platelets, as well as from AAA tissue-conditioned medium (thrombus and wall). Ficolin-3 levels were analyzed by western-blot, real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Results Increased ficolin-3 levels were observed in microvesicles isolated from activated platelets. Similarly, microvesicles released from AAA tissue display increased ficolin-3 levels as compared with those from healthy tissue. Moreover, ficolin-3 mRNA levels in the AAA wall were greatly increased compared with healthy aortic walls. Immunohistochemistry of AAA tissue demonstrated increased ficolin-3, whereas little staining was present in healthy walls. Finally, increased ficolin-3 levels were observed in AAA patients' plasma (n = 478) compared with control plasma (n = 176), which persisted after adjustment for risk factors (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 5.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.27, 8.57)]. Moreover, a positive association of ficolin-3 with aortic diameter (Rho, 0.25) and need for surgical repair was observed, also after adjustment for potential confounding factors (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11, 2.15). Conclusions In addition to its hepatic expression, ficolin-3 may be released into the extracellular medium via microvesicles, by both activated cells and pathological AAA tissue. Ficolin-3 plasma levels are associated with the presence and progression of AAA, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker of AAA.

Use of Engineered Exosomes Expressing HLA and Costimulatory Molecules to Generate Antigen-specific CD8+ T Cells for Adoptive Cell Therapy.	J Immunother	2017	Dendritic cell-derived exosomes (DEX) comprise an efficient stimulator of T cells. However, the production of sufficient DEX remains a barrier to their broad applicability in immunotherapeutic approaches. In previous studies, genetically engineered K562 have been used to generate artificial antigen presenting cells (AAPC). Here, we isolated exosomes from K562 cells (referred to as CoEX-A2s) engineered to express human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 and costimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD83, and 41BBL. CoEX-A2s were capable of stimulating antigen-specific CD8 T cells both directly and indirectly via CoEX-A2 cross-dressed cells. Notably, CoEX-A2s also generated similar levels of HCMV pp65-specific and MART1-specific CD8 T cells as DEX in vitro. The results suggest that these novel exosomes may provide a crucial reagent for generating antigen-specific CD8 T cells for adoptive cell therapies against viral infection and tumors.

We questioned whether short non-coding RNA species of unknown function within CDC-EVs contribute to cardioprotection. The most abundant RNA species in CDC-EVs is a Y RNA fragment (EV-YF1); its relative abundance in CDC-EVs correlates with CDC potency in vivo Fluorescently labeled EV-YF1 is actively transferred from CDCs to target macrophages via CDC-EVs. Direct transfection of macrophages with EV-YF1 induced transcription and secretion of IL-10. When cocultured with rat cardiomyocytes, EV-YF1-primed macrophages were potently cytoprotective toward oxidatively stressed cardiomyocytes through induction of IL-10. In vivo, intracoronary injection of EV-YF1 following ischemia/reperfusion reduced infarct size. A fragment of Y RNA, highly enriched in CDC-EVs, alters Il10 gene expression and enhances IL-10 protein secretion. The demonstration that EV-YF1 confers cardioprotection highlights the potential importance of diverse exosomal contents of unknown function, above and beyond the usual suspects (e.g., microRNAs and proteins).

Quantitative changes in the protein and miRNA cargo of plasma exosome-like vesicles after exposure to ionizing radiation.	Int J Radiat Biol	2017	PURPOSE: Multiple cell types secrete exosome-like extracellular vesicles (ELVs) to the extracellular environment. Pathological conditions can produce characteristic changes to the vesicle cargo. We investigated if ionizing radiation is capable of inducing changes in the protein and microRNA (miRNA) cargo of ELVs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole blood samples from healthy donors were irradiated with 2 Gy gamma rays and then peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma were separated from residual blood and co-cultivated for 24 h. The released ELVs were collected by differential ultracentrifugation from irradiated and non-irradiated samples. microRNAs and proteins were quantified by qPCR and label-free proteomics. RESULTS: Here we report a first characterization of radiation-induced changes in the protein and miRNA cargo of ELVs isolated from plasma. Proteome analysis of ELVs identified 214 proteins, of which nine significantly changed their abundance after irradiation. The radiation-induced down-regulation of afamin and serpine peptidase F1 was confirmed by immunoblotting. miRNA expression profiling identified 58 different exosomal miRNAs, the expression of miR-204-5p, miR-92a-3p and miR-31-5p was significantly increased in ELVs from irradiated samples. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that radiation-induced changes occur in the protein and miRNA cargo of plasma ELVs. These data imply a novel systemic communication pathway between irradiated and non-irradiated cells and tissues.

Electronic address: .	karpova@niboch.nsc.ru		Cytosolic YB-1 and NSUN2 are the only proteins recognizing specific motifs present in mRNAs enriched in exosomes.	Biochim Biophys Acta	2017	Exosomes, membranous vesicles secreted by various cells, are involved in intercellular communication and carry vast repertoires of RNAs and proteins. Processes mediating RNA sorting into exosomes are currently poorly understood. Using bioinformatics approaches, three structural motifs ACCAGCCU, CAGUGAGC and UAAUCCCA have been discovered as enriched in exosomal mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs. Here, utilizing short RNA hairpins, each containing one of the motifs, in a pull-down assay of cytosolic extract of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, we prove that multifunctional RNA-binding protein YB-1 specifically interacts with all three motifs, whereas methyltransferase NSUN2 recognizes only the motif CAGUGAGC. RNA hairpins other than those mentioned above pull out neither YB-1 nor NSUN2. Both these proteins are found in exosomes secreted by HEK293 cells. YB-1 for all that is detected as a form having a slightly higher electrophoretic mobility than that of YB-1 associated with the above RNA hairpins, assuming changes in posttranslational modifications of the protein during its transfer from cytoplasm into exosomes. Next generation sequencing of total exosomal RNA (eRNA) reveals a large representative set of RNA species, including mRNAs containing the above-mentioned motifs. The degree of enrichment in exosomes with this kind of mRNAs strongly depends on the locations of eRNA-specific motifs within the mRNA sequences. Altogether, our findings point to YB-1 and NSUN2 as possible mediators of the process of transfer of specific mRNAs into exosomes, allowing us to speculate on an involvement of these proteins in the mRNA sorting via the recognition of the above motifs.

Clin Cancer Res	2017	Purpose: Head and neck cancers (HNCs) often induce profound immunosuppression, which contributes to disease progression and interferes with immune-based therapies. Body fluids of patients with HNC are enriched in exosomes potentially engaged in negative regulation of antitumor immune responses. The presence and content of exosomes derived from plasma of patients with HNC are evaluated for the ability to induce immune dysfunction and influence disease activity.Experimental Design: Exosomes were isolated by size-exclusion chromatography from plasma of 38 patients with HNC and 14 healthy donors. Morphology, size, numbers, and protein and molecular contents of the recovered exosomes were determined. Coculture assays were performed to measure exosome-mediated effects on functions of normal human lymphocyte subsets and natural killer (NK) cells. The results were correlated with disease stage and activity.Results: The presence, quantity, and molecular content of isolated, plasma-derived exosomes discriminated patients with HNC with active disease (AD) from those with no evident disease (NED) after oncologic therapies. Exosomes of patients with AD were significantly more effective than exosomes of patients with NED in inducing apoptosis of CD8+ T cells, suppression of CD4+ T-cell proliferation, and upregulation of regulatory T-cell (Treg) suppressor functions (all at P < 0.05). Exosomes of patients with AD also downregulated NKG2D expression levels in NK cells.Conclusions: Exosomes in plasma of patients with HNC carry immunosuppressive molecules and interfere with functions of immune cells. Exosome-induced immune suppression correlates with disease activity in HNC, suggesting that plasma exosomes could be useful as biomarkers of HNC progression.

J Dairy Sci	2017	The greatest risk of metabolic and infectious disease in dairy cows is during the transition from pregnancy to lactating (i.e., the transition period). The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of extracellular vesicles (microvesicles involved in cell-to-cell signaling) isolated from transition cows on target cell function. We previously identified differences in the protein profiles of exosomes isolated from cows divergent in metabolic health status. Therefore, we hypothesized that these exosomes would affect target tissues differently. To investigate this, 2 groups of cows (n = 5/group) were selected based on the concentration of β-hydroxybutyrate and fatty acids in plasma and triacylglycerol concentration in liver at wk 1 and 2 postcalving. Cows with high concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate, fatty acids, and triacylglycerol were considered at increased risk of clinical disease during the transition period (high-risk group; n = 5) and were compared with cows that had low concentrations of the selected health indicators (low-risk group; n = 5). At 2 time points during the transition period (postcalving at wk 1 and 4), blood was sampled and plasma exosomes were isolated from the high-risk and low-risk cows. The exosomes were applied at concentrations of 10 and 1 µg/mL to 5 × 103 Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells grown to 50% confluence in 96-well plates. Results indicate a numerical increase in cell proliferation when exosomes from high-risk cows were applied compared with those from low-risk cows. Consistent with an effect on cell proliferation, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR indicated a trend for upregulation of 3 proinflammatory genes (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and CD27 ligand) with the application of high-risk exosomes, which are involved in cellular growth and survival. Proteomic analysis indicated 2 proteins in the low-risk group that were not identified in the high-risk group (endoplasmin and catalase), which may also be indicative of the metabolic state of origin. It is likely that the metabolic state of the transition cow affects cellular function through exosomal messaging; however, more in-depth research into cross-talk between exosomes and target cells is required to determine whether exosomes influence Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells in this manner.

A chemical approach to myocardial protection and regeneration.	Eur Heart J Suppl	2016	The possibility of generating induced pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human adult fibroblasts has introduced new perspectives for possible therapeutic strategies to repair damaged hearts. However, obtaining large numbers of adult stem cells is still an ongoing challenge, and the safety of genetic reprogramming with lenti- or retro-viruses has several drawbacks not easy to be addressed. Furthermore, the majority of adult stem cell-based clinical trials for heart regeneration have had generally poor and controversial results. Nonetheless, it is now clear that the injected cells activate the growth and differentiation of progenitor cells that are already present in the heart. This is achieved by the release of signalling factors and/or exosomes carrying them. Along this line, chemistry may play a major role in developing new strategies for activating resident stem cells to regenerate the heart. In particular, this review focuses on small molecule approaches for cell reprogramming, cell differentiation, and activation of cell protection.

Electronic address: .	shyuan@ucsd.edu		Novel human neuronal tau model exhibiting neurofibrillary tangles and transcellular propagation.	Neurobiol Dis	2017	Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy, which are associated with the pathological aggregation of tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Studies have characterized tau as a "prion-like" protein given its ability to form distinct, stable amyloid conformations capable of transcellular and multigenerational propagation in clonal fashion. It has been proposed that progression of tauopathy could be due to the prion-like propagation of tau, suggesting the possibility that end-stage pathologies, like NFT formation, may require an instigating event such as tau seeding. To investigate this, we applied a novel human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) system we have developed to serve as a human neuronal model. We introduced the tau repeat domain (tau-RD) with P301L and V337M (tau-RD-LM) mutations into hiPSC-derived neurons and observed expression of tau-RD at levels similar to total tau in postmortem AD brains. Tau aggregation occurred without the addition of recombinant tau fibrils. The conditioned media from tau-RD cultures contained tau-RD seeds, which were capable of inducing aggregate formation in homotypic mode in non-transduced recipient neuronal cultures. The resultant NFTs were thioflavin-positive, silver stain-positive, and assumed fibrillary appearance on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with immunogold, which revealed paired helical filament 1 (PHF1)-positive NFTs, representing possible recruitment of endogenous tau in the aggregates. Functionally, expression of tau-RD caused neurotoxicity that manifested as axon retraction, synaptic density reduction, and enlargement of lysosomes. The results of our hiPSC study were reinforced by the observation that Tau-RD-LM is excreted in exosomes, which mediated the transfer of human tau to wild-type mouse neurons in vivo. Our hiPSC human neuronal system provides a model for further studies of tau aggregation and pathology as well as a means to study transcellular propagation and related neurodegenerative mechanisms.

Glioma cells enhance angiogenesis and inhibit endothelial cell apoptosis through the release of exosomes that contain long non-coding RNA CCAT2.	Oncol Rep	2017	Angiogenesis is a key event in the progression of gliomas. Exosomes, as signaling extracellular organelles, modulate the tumor microenvironment and promote angiogenesis and tumor progression. We previously demonstrated that long intergenic non-coding RNA CCAT2 (linc-CCAT2) was overexpressed in glioma tissues and functioned to promote glioma progression. Therefore, this study aimed to explore an underlying mechanism of glioma cell-affected angiogenesis. First, qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression level of linc-CCAT2 in 4 glioma cell lines and 293T cells, and the results revealed that the U87-MG cells exhibited the highest expression level. Subsequently, the pro-angiogenesis function of exosomes that were derived from negative control shRNA-treated U87-MG cells (ncU87-Exo) and linc-CCAT2 shRNA-treated U87-MG cells (shU87-Exo) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. We found that ncU87-Exo, which was enriched in linc-CCAT2, could be taken up by HUVECs. ncU87-Exo improved the linc-CCAT2 expression level in HUVECs and more strongly promoted HUVEC migration, proliferation, tubular-like structure formation in vitro and arteriole formation in vivo as well as inhibited HUVEC apoptosis induced by hypoxia. Further mechanistic studies revealed that ncU87-Exo could upregulate VEGFA and TGFβ expression in HUVECs as well as promote Bcl-2 expression and inhibit Bax and caspase-3 expression. Finally, gain-/loss-of-function studies revealed that the overexpression of linc-CCAT2 in HUVECs activated VEGFA and TGFβ, promoted angiogenesis, promoted Bcl-2 expression and inhibited Bax and caspase-3 expression, thus decreasing apoptosis. Downregulation of linc-CCAT2 revealed the opposite effect. Thus, our results revealed a new exosome‑mediated mechanism by which glioma cells could promote angiogenesis through the transfer of linc-CCAT2 by exosomes to endothelial cells. Moreover, we suggest that exosomes and linc-CCAT2 are putative therapeutic targets in glioma.	PMC5562059

Feasibility of urinary extracellular vesicle proteome profiling using a robust and simple, clinically applicable isolation method.	J Extracell Vesicles	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by prostate cancer (PCa) cells contain specific biomarkers and can be isolated from urine. Collection of urine is not invasive, and therefore urinary EVs represent a liquid biopsy for diagnostic and prognostic testing for PCa. In this study, we optimised urinary EV isolation using a method based on heat shock proteins and compared it to gold-standard ultracentrifugation. The urinary EV isolation protocol using the Vn96-peptide is easier, time convenient (≈1.5 h) and no special equipment is needed, in contrast to ultracentrifugation protocol (>3.5 h), making this protocol clinically feasible. We compared the isolated vesicles of both ultracentrifugation and Vn96-peptide by proteome profiling using mass spectrometry-based proteomics (n = 4 per method). We reached a depth of >3000 proteins, with 2400 proteins that were commonly detected in urinary EVs from different donors. We show a large overlap (>85%) between proteins identified in EVs isolated by ultracentrifugation and Vn96-peptide. Addition of the detergent NP40 to Vn96-peptide EV isolations reduced levels of background proteins and highly increased the levels of the EV-markers TSG101 and PDCD6IP, indicative of an increased EV yield. Thus, the Vn96-peptide-based EV isolation procedure is clinically feasibly and allows large-scale protein profiling of urinary EV biomarkers.	PMC5505003

Circulating exosome microRNA associated with heart failure secondary to myxomatous mitral valve disease in a naturally occurring canine model.	J Extracell Vesicles	2017	Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is functionally and histologically identical to mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in humans. Currently, there are no medical treatments that can delay the progression of this valvular disease or associated cardiac remodelling. Therefore, there is a need to understand the molecular pathology associated with MMVD and MVP better, and thus identify potential therapeutic targets. Circulating exosomes contain small RNA, including miRNA, which reflect cell physiology and pathology. This study explored the association between circulating exosomal miRNA (ex-miRNA) content and MMVD, heart failure due to MMVD (MMVD-CHF) and ageing, which is strongly associated with MMVD. Ex-miRNA was isolated from old normal/healthy dogs (n = 6), young normal dogs (n = 7), dogs with MMVD (n = 7) and dogs with MMVD-CHF (n = 7). Separately, total plasma miRNA was isolated from normal dogs (n = 8), dogs with MMVD (n = 8) and dogs with MMVD-CHF (n = 11). Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, exosomal miR-181c (p = 0.003) and miR-495 (p = 0.0001) significantly increased in dogs with MMVD-CHF compared to the other three groups. Exosomal miR-9 (p = 0.002) increased in dogs with MMVD and MMVD-CHF compared to age-matched (old) normal dogs. Exosomal miR-599 (p = 0.002) decreased in dogs with MMVD compared to old normal dogs. In total plasma, 58 miRNA were deemed significantly different (p < 0.04) between normal dogs, dogs with MMVD and dogs with MMVD-CHF. However, in contrast to ex-miRNA, none of the miRNA in total plasma remained statistically significant if the false discovery rate was <15%. Changes in ex-miRNA are observed in dogs as they age (miR-9, miR-495 and miR-599), develop MMVD (miR-9 and miR-599) and progress from MMVD to CHF (miR-181c and miR-495). Ex-miRNA expression-level changes appear to be more specific to disease states than total plasma miRNA. RESPONSIBLE EDITOR Elena Aikawa, Harvard Medical School, USA.	PMC5533140

Mol Cancer	2017	BACKGROUND: To overcome the hostile hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors, tumor cells secrete a large number of non-coding RNA-containing exosomes that facilitate tumor development and metastasis. However, the precise mechanisms of tumor cell-derived exosomes during hypoxia are unknown. Here, we aim to clarify whether hypoxia affects tumor growth and progression by transferring long non-coding RNA-urothelial cancer-associated 1 (lncRNA-UCA1) enriched exosomes secreted from bladder cancer cells. METHODS: We used bladder cancer 5637 cells with high expression of lncRNA-UCA1 as exosome-generating cells and bladder cancer UMUC2 cells with low expression of lncRNA-UCA1 as recipient cells. Exosomes derived from 5637 cells cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions were isolated and identified by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blotting analysis. These exosomes were co-cultured with UMUC2 cells to evaluate cell proliferation, migration and invasion. We further investigated the roles of exosomal lncRNA-UCA1 derived from hypoxic 5637 cells by xenograft models. The availability of lncRNA-UCA1 in serum-derived exosomes as a biomarker for bladder cancer was also assessed. RESULTS: We found that hypoxic exosomes derived from 5637 cells promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and hypoxic exosomal RNAs could be internalized by three bladder cancer cell lines. Importantly, lncRNA-UCA1 was secreted in hypoxic 5637 cell-derived exosomes. Compared with normoxic exosomes, hypoxic exosomes derived from 5637 cells showed the higher expression levels of lncRNA-UCA1. Moreover, Hypoxic exosomal lncRNA-UCA1 could promote tumor growth and progression though epithelial-mesenchymal transition, in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the expression levels of lncRNA-UCA1 in the human serum-derived exosomes of bladder cancer patients were higher than that in the healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Together, our results demonstrate that hypoxic bladder cancer cells remodel tumor microenvironment to facilitate tumor growth and development though secreting the oncogenic lncRNA-UCA1-enriched exosomes and exosomal lncRNA-UCA1 in human serum has the possibility as a diagnostic biomarker for bladder cancer.

Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol	2018	OBJECTIVE: During inflammation, macrophages secrete vesicles carrying RNA, protein, and lipids as a form of extracellular communication. In the vessel wall, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to be transferred between vascular cells during atherosclerosis; however, the role of macrophage-derived EVs in atherogenesis is not known. Here, we hypothesize that atherogenic macrophages secrete microRNAs (miRNAs) in EVs to mediate cell-cell communication and promote proinflammatory and proatherogenic phenotypes in recipient cells. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We isolated EVs from mouse and human macrophages treated with an atherogenic stimulus (oxidized low-density lipoprotein) and characterized the EV miRNA expression profile. We confirmed the enrichment of miR-146a, miR-128, miR-185, miR-365, and miR-503 in atherogenic EVs compared with controls and demonstrate that these EVs are taken up and transfer exogenous miRNA to naive recipient macrophages. Bioinformatic pathway analysis suggests that atherogenic EV miRNAs are predicted to target genes involved in cell migration and adhesion pathways, and indeed delivery of EVs to naive macrophages reduced macrophage migration both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of miR-146a, the most enriched miRNA in atherogenic EVs, reduced the inhibitory effect of EVs on macrophage migratory capacity. EV-mediated delivery of miR-146a repressed the expression of target genes IGF2BP1 (insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1) and HuR (human antigen R or ELAV-like RNA-binding protein 1) in recipient cells, and knockdown of IGF2BP1 and HuR using short interfering RNA greatly reduced macrophage migration, highlighting the importance of these EV-miRNA targets in regulating macrophage motility. CONCLUSIONS: EV-derived miRNAs from atherogenic macrophages, in particular miR-146a, may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis by decreasing cell migration and promoting macrophage entrapment in the vessel wall.

J Circ Biomark	2016 Jan-Dec	Urine exosomes (extracellular vesicles; EVs) contain (micro)RNA (miRNA) and protein biomarkers that are useful for the non-invasive diagnosis of various urological diseases. However, the urinary Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) complex, which forms at reduced temperatures, may affect EV isolation and may also lead to contamination by other molecules including microRNAs (miRNAs). Therefore, we compared the levels of three miRNAs within the purified EV fraction and THP- protein-network. Urine was collected from healthy donors and EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation (UC), two commercial kits or sepharose size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC enables the separation of EVs from protein-complexes in urine. After UC, the isolation of EV-miRNA was compared with two commercial kits. The EV isolation efficiency was evaluated by measuring the EV protein markers, Alix and TSG101, CD63 by Western blotting, or miR-375, miR-204 and miR-21 by RT-qPCR. By using commercial kits, EV isolation resulted in either low yields or dissimilar miRNA levels. Via SEC, the EVs were separated from the protein-complex fraction. Importantly, a different ratio was observed between the three miRNAs in the protein fraction compared to the EV fraction. Thus, protein-complexes within urine may influence EV-biomarker studies. Therefore, the characterization of the isolated EV fraction is important to obtain reproducible results.	PMC5548314

Eur Heart J	2017	Aim: The aim is to assess the effects of CDCs on heart structure, function, gene expression, and systemic parameters in aged rats. Diastolic dysfunction is characteristic of aged hearts. Cardiosphere-derived cell (CDC) therapy has exhibited several favourable effects on heart structure and function in humans and in preclinical models; however, the effects of CDCs on aging have not been evaluated. Methods and Results: We compared intra-cardiac injections of neonatal rat CDCs to vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) in 21.8 ± 1.6 month-old rats (mean ± standard deviation; n = 23 total). Ten rats 4.1 ± 1.5 months of age comprised a young reference group. Blood, echocardiographic, haemodynamic and treadmill stress tests were performed at baseline in all animals, and 1 month after treatment in old animals. Histology and the transcriptome were assessed after terminal phenotyping. For in vitro studies, human heart progenitors from older donors, or cardiomyocytes from aged rats were exposed to human CDCs or exosomes secreted by CDCs (CDC-XO) from paediatric donors. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CDCs, but not PBS, recapitulated a youthful pattern of gene expression in the hearts of old animals (85.5% of genes differentially expressed, P < 0.05). Telomeres in heart cells were longer in CDC-transplanted animals (P < 0.0001 vs. PBS). Cardiosphere-derived cells attenuated hypertrophy by echo (P < 0.01); histology confirmed decreases in cardiomyocyte area (P < 0.0001) and myocardial fibrosis (P < 0.05) vs. PBS. Cardiosphere-derived cell injection improved diastolic dysfunction [lower E/A (P < 0.01), E/E' (P = 0.05), end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (P < 0.05) compared with baseline), and lowered serum brain natriuretic peptide (both P < 0.05 vs. PBS). In CDC-transplanted old rats, exercise capacity increased ∼20% (P < 0.05 vs. baseline), body weight decreased ∼30% less (P = 0.05 vs. PBS) and hair regrowth after shaving was more robust (P < 0.05 vs. PBS). Serum biomarkers of inflammation (IL-10, IL-1b, and IL-6) improved in the CDC group (P < 0.05 for each, all vs. PBS). Young CDCs secrete exosomes which increase telomerase activity, elongate telomere length, and reduce the number of senescent human heart cells in culture. Conclusion: Young CDCs rejuvenate old animals as gauged by cardiac gene expression, heart function, exercise capacity, and systemic biomarkers.	PMC5837602

Nat Commun	2017	Tumor-released RNA may mediate intercellular communication and serve as biomarkers. Here we develop a protocol enabling quantitative, minimally biased analysis of extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) associated with microvesicles, exosomes (collectively called EVs), and ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). The exRNA complexes isolated from patient-derived glioma stem-like cultures exhibit distinct compositions, with microvesicles most closely reflecting cellular transcriptome. exRNA is enriched in small ncRNAs, such as miRNAs in exosomes, and precisely processed tRNA and Y RNA fragments in EVs and exRNPs. EV-enclosed mRNAs are mostly fragmented, and UTRs enriched; nevertheless, some full-length mRNAs are present. Overall, there is less than one copy of non-rRNA per EV. Our results suggest that massive EV/exRNA uptake would be required to ensure functional impact of transferred RNA on brain recipient cells and predict the most impactful miRNAs in such conditions. This study also provides a catalog of diverse exRNAs useful for biomarker discovery and validates its feasibility on cerebrospinal fluid.	PMC5658400

Comprehensive microRNA-sequencing of exosomes derived from head and neck carcinoma cells in vitro reveals common secretion profiles and potential utility as salivary biomarkers.	Oncotarget	2017	Exosomes are nano-scale, membrane encapsulated vesicles that are released by cells into the extracellular space and function as intercellular signaling vectors through horizontal transfer of biologic molecules, including microRNA (miRNA). There is evidence that cancer-derived exosomes enable the tumor to manipulate its microenvironment, thus contributing to the capacity of the tumor for immune evasion, growth, invasion, and metastatic spread. The objective of this study was to characterize differential secretion of exosomal miRNA by head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and identify a set of candidate biomarkers that could be detected in non-invasive saliva samples. We isolated exosomes from conditioned media from 4 HNSCC cell lines and oral epithelial control cells and applied miRNA-sequencing to comprehensively characterize their miRNA cargo and compare transcript levels of each HNSCC cell line to that of oral epithelial control cells. A candidate set of miRNA differentially secreted by all 4 HNSCC cell lines was further evaluated in saliva collected from HNSCC patients and healthy controls. We observed extensive differences in exosomal miRNA content between HNSCC cells when compared to normal oral epithelial control cells, with a high degree of overlap in exosomal miRNA profiles between the 4 distinct HNSCC cell lines. Importantly, several of the exosomal miRNA secreted solely by cancer cells in culture were detected at substantially elevated levels in saliva from HNSCC patients relative to saliva from healthy controls. These findings provide important insight into tumor biology and yields a promising set of candidate HNSCC biomarkers for use with non-invasive saliva samples.	PMC5669904

Tunneling nanotubes: A versatile target for cancer therapy.	Curr Cancer Drug Targets	2017	Currently Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. Malignancy or cancer is a class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth that eventually invade other tissues and dvelop secondary malignant growth at other sites by metastasis. Intercellular communication plays a major in cancer, particularly in the process of cell proliferation and coordination which in turn leads to tumor invasion, metastasis and development of resistance to therapy. Cells communicate among themselves in a variety of ways, namely, i) via gap junctions with adjacent cells, ii) via exosomes with nearby cells and iii) via chemical messengers with distant cells. Besides, cell - cell connection by tunneling nanotubes (TnTs) is recently gaining importance where intercellular components are transferred between cells. In general cell organelles like Golgi vesicle and mitochondria; and biomolecules like nucleic acids and proteins are transferred through these TnTs. These TnTs are long cytoplasmic extensions made up of actin that function as intercellular bridge and connect a wide verity of cell types. Malignant cells form TnTs with either another malignant cells or cells of the surrounding tumor matrix. These TnTs help in the process of initiation of tumor formation, its organization and propagation. The current review focuses on the role of TnTs mediated cell – cell signaling in cancer micro-environment. Drugs that inhibit TnT-formation such as metformin and everolimus can be targeted towards TnTs in the management of cancer growth, proliferation, tumor invasion and metastasis.

Oncol Lett	2017	Exosomes have gained increased research focus due to their key roles as messengers. The components of exosomes include proteins and RNAs that may be horizontally transferred between adjacent or distant cells. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most malignant types of cancer worldwide, with exosomes implicated to play a crucial role in its regulation; however, the possible function of exosomes in modulating the motile ability of tumor cells and key molecules in HCC remain largely unknown. To investigate the regulatory effect of exosomes on the motile ability of HCC cells, exosomes from the culture medium of different HCC origins (high metastatic MHCC97-H and low metastatic MHCC97-L cells) were isolated for in vitro migration and invasion assays. The results indicated that the motile ability of MHCC97-L cells was significantly increased by pretreatment with MHCC97-H-derived exosomes when compared with MHCC97-L-exosome pretreatment (P<0.05). To further characterize the function of exosomes at the molecular level, protein profiling of exosomes from different cell origins was performed, which identified 129 proteins. Among these, adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1, a protein implicated in HCC metastasis, was significantly enriched in exosomes from cells with high motile ability (P<0.05). The results of the present study validated the regulatory effect of exosomes on the motile ability of HCC cells. Furthermore, systematic analysis of the protein profiles of exosomes from different origins identified potential factors correlated with HCC metastasis, which may provide a basis for future functional analysis of exosomes regarding their involvement in cancer metastasis and recurrence.

Extracellular miR-224 as a prognostic marker for clear cell renal cell carcinoma.	Oncotarget	2017	Exosome-miRNAs (exo-miR) have recently been identified as modulators of cancer progression and distant metastasis. We previously found that intracellular miR-224 is up-regulated and significantly related to cancer invasion and metastasis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). We therefore investigated the role of exosome miR-224 in ccRCC and explored the interaction between intra- and extracellular miR-224 in renal cell carcinoma. To validate the method for isolating exosomes from blood samples or cell culture media, we examined exosome morphology using transmission electron microscope (TEM). We investigated the relationship between exo-miR-224 expression and patient prognosis in 108 ccRCC patients. We isolated exosomes from a metastatic renal cancer cell line and tested their effects on a primary renal cancer cell line with several functional analyses. We found that the high expression level exo-miR-224 group has significantly shorter progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival compared with the low expression group. In multivariate analysis, a high level of exo-miR-224 was a significant risk factor related to all prognoses investigated. After adding exosomes from a metastatic RCC cell line to a primary RCC cell line, cell proliferation and invasion were increased while the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly decreased. Intracellular levels of miR-224 were significantly up-regulated in the primary renal cancer cell line. Extracellular miR-224 in exosomes impacts on patient prognosis and is a potential prognostic biomarker for ccRCC patients.	PMC5746350

Extrusion of mtDNA into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid occurs as an early event in mice subjected to cigarette smoke injury, concomitantly with the depletion of mtDNA in the lung tissue. In cultured lung epithelial cells, prolonged, low-level oxidative stress damages the mtDNA, without any detectable damage to the nuclear DNA. In turn, cellular depletion of the mtDNA occurs, together with a transient remodeling of cellular bioenergetics and morphology - all without any detectable impairment in overall cell viability. Damaged mtDNA first enters the cytoplasm, where it binds to Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) and triggers inflammation via the TANK-binding kinase 1 /interferon regulatory factor 3 signaling pathway. Fragments of the mtDNA are subsequently released into the extracellular space via exosomes. MtDNA-containing exosomes are capable of inducing an inflammatory response in naïve (non-oxidatively stressed) epithelial cells. In vivo, administration of isolated mtDNA into the in lungs of naïve mice induces the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, without histopathologic evidence of tissue injury. We propose that mtDNA-specific damage, and subsequent activation of the ZBP1 pathway, is a mechanism that links prolonged, low-level oxidative stress to autocrine and paracrine inflammation during the early stages of inflammatory lung disease.

Adv Drug Deliv Rev	2018	Impaired healing of cutaneous wounds and ulcers continues to have a major impact on the quality of life of millions of people. In recent years, the capacity for stem and progenitor cells to promote wound repair has been investigated with evidence that secreted factors are responsible for the observed therapeutic benefits. This review addresses current evidence in support of stem/progenitor cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a regenerative therapy for acceleration of wound healing. Encouraging results for local or systemic administration of EVs have been reported in a range of clinically-relevant animal models of cutaneous wounds. Furthermore, a number of plausible mechanisms involving EV-mediated transfer of proteins and RNAs that trigger pro-repair pathways in target cells have been demonstrated experimentally. However, for successful clinical translation in the coming years, further emphasis on standardized experimental protocols, detailed methodological reporting and clear definition of EV-based therapeutic products will be required.

Comprehensive miRNA Analysis of Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells and Extracellular Vesicles.	Kidney Blood Press Res	2018	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) participate in the tissue-specific repair of many different organs, especially the kidney. Their effects are primarily mediated by the paracrine release of factors including extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are composed of micro-vesicles and exosomes. The corresponding microRNAs (miRNAs) of EVs are considered important for their biological functions. METHODS: MSCs were cultured from the human umbilical cord, and EVs were isolated from the medium. The expression levels of miRNAs in MSCs and EVs were determined by microarray analysis, and gene ontology (GO) was used to analyze the functions of their target genes. RESULTS: MSCs and EVs had similar miRNA expression profiles, with the exception of a small number of selectively enriched miRNAs. GO analysis indicated that, unlike MSCs, the target genes of EV-enriched miRNAs were associated with calcium channel regulation and cell junction activities, which may indicate that MSC and EVs have different regulatory properties. Angiogenesis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory signaling pathways related to the repair of renal injury were also analyzed, and EV-enriched miRNAs targeted genes associated with oxidative stress, T cell activation, and Toll-like receptor signaling. The miRNAs enriched in both MSCs and EVs targeted different genes in signaling pathways regulating angiogenesis and chemokine release. CONCLUSION: MSCs and their EVs shared similar miRNA component, and some selectively enriched miRNAs observed in MSCs and EVs may affect different target genes through some specific signaling pathways.

J Neuroimmune Pharmacol	2018	Chronic neuroinflammation still remains a common underlying feature of HIV-infected patients on combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART). Previous studies have reported that despite near complete suppression of virus replication by cART, cytotoxic viral proteins such as HIV trans-activating regulatory protein (Tat) continue to persist in tissues such as the brain and the lymph nodes, thereby contributing, in part, to chronic glial activation observed in HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND). Understanding how the glial cells cross talk to mediate neuropathology is thus of paramount importance. MicroRNAs (miR) also known as regulators of gene expression, have emerged as key paracrine signaling mediators that regulate disease pathogenesis and cellular crosstalk, through their transfer via the extracellular vesicles (EV). In the current study we have identified a novel function of miR-9, that of mediating microglial migration. We demonstrate that miR-9 released from Tat-stimulated astrocytes can be taken up by microglia resulting in their migratory phenotype. Exposure of human astrocytoma (A172) cells to HIV Tat resulted in induction and release of miR-9 in the EVs, which, was taken up by microglia, leading in turn, increased migration of the latter cells, a process that could be blocked by both an exosome inhibitor GW4869 or a specific target protector of miR-9. Furthermore, it was also demonstrated that EV miR-9 mediated inhibition of the expression of target PTEN, via its binding to the 3'UTR seed sequence of the PTEN mRNA, was critical for microglial migration. To validate the role of miR-9 in this process, microglial cells were treated with EVs loaded with miR-9, which resulted in significant downregulation of PTEN expression with a concomitant increase in microglial migration. These findings were corroborated by transfecting microglia with a specific target protector of PTEN, that blocked miR-9-mediated downregulation of PTEN as well as microglial migration. In vivo studies wherein the miR-9 precursor-transduced microglia were transplanted into the striatum of mice, followed by assessing their migration in response to a stimulus administered distally, further validated the role of miR-9 in mediating microglial migration. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that glial crosstalk via miRs released from EVs play a vital role in mediating disease pathogenesis and could provide new avenues for development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at dampening neuropathogenesis.

Crit Care	2018	BACKGROUND: Exosomes isolated from plasma of patients with sepsis may induce vascular apoptosis and myocardial dysfunction by mechanisms related to inflammation and oxidative stress. Despite previous studies demonstrating that these vesicles contain genetic material related to cellular communication, their molecular cargo during sepsis is relatively unknown. In this study, we evaluated the presence of microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) related to inflammatory response and redox metabolism in exosomes of patients with septic shock. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 24 patients with septic shock at ICU admission and after 7 days of treatment. Twelve healthy volunteers were used as control subjects. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation, and their miRNA and mRNA content was evaluated by qRT-PCR array. RESULTS: As compared with healthy volunteers, exosomes from patients with sepsis had significant changes in 65 exosomal miRNAs. Twenty-eight miRNAs were differentially expressed, both at enrollment and after 7 days, with similar kinetics (18 miRNAs upregulated and 10 downregulated). At enrollment, 35 differentially expressed miRNAs clustered patients with sepsis according to survival. The pathways enriched by the miRNAs of patients with sepsis compared with control subjects were related mostly to inflammatory response. The comparison of miRNAs from patients with sepsis according to hospital survival demonstrated pathways related mostly to cell cycle regulation. At enrollment, sepsis was associated with significant increases in the expression of mRNAs related to redox metabolism (myeloperoxidase, 64-fold; PRDX3, 2.6-fold; SOD2, 2.2-fold) and redox-responsive genes (FOXM1, 21-fold; SELS, 16-fold; GLRX2, 3.4-fold). The expression of myeloperoxidase mRNA remained elevated after 7 days (65-fold). CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes from patients with septic shock convey miRNAs and mRNAs related to pathogenic pathways, including inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and cell cycle regulation. Exosomes may represent a novel mechanism for intercellular communication during sepsis.	PMC5852953

J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle	2018	BACKGROUND: The treatment of muscle wasting is accompanied by benefits in other organs, possibly resulting from muscle-organ crosstalk. However, how the muscle communicates with these organs is less understood. Two microRNAs (miRs), miR-23a and miR-27a, are located together in a gene cluster and regulate proteins that are involved in the atrophy process. MiR-23a/27a has been shown to reduce muscle wasting and act as an anti-fibrotic agent. We hypothesized that intramuscular injection of miR-23a/27a would counteract both muscle wasting and renal fibrosis lesions in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic model. METHODS: We generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that overexpresses the miR-23a∼27a∼24-2 precursor RNA and injected it into the tibialis anterior muscle of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Muscle cross-section area (immunohistology plus software measurement) and muscle function (grip strength) were used to evaluate muscle atrophy. Fibrosis-related proteins were measured by western blot to monitor renal damage. In some cases, AAV-GFP was used to mimic the miR movement in vivo, allowing us to track organ redistribution by using the Xtreme Imaging System. RESULTS: The injection of AAV-miR-23a/27a increased the levels of miR-23a and miR-27a as well as increased phosphorylated Akt, attenuated the levels of FoxO1 and PTEN proteins, and reduced the abundance of TRIM63/MuRF1 and FBXO32/atrogin-1 in skeletal muscles. It also decreased myostatin mRNA and protein levels as well as the levels of phosphorylated pSMAD2/3. Provision of miR-23a/27a attenuates the diabetes-induced reduction of muscle cross-sectional area and muscle function. Curiously, the serum BUN of diabetic animals was reduced in mice undergoing the miR-23a/27a intervention. Renal fibrosis, evaluated by Masson trichromatic staining, was also decreased as were kidney levels of phosphorylated SMAD2/3, alpha smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, and collagen. In diabetic mice injected intramuscularly with AAV-GFP, GFP fluorescence levels in the kidneys showed linear correlation with the levels in injected muscle when examined by linear regression. Following intramuscular injection of AAV-miR-23a∼27a∼24-2, the levels of miR-23a and miR-27a in serum exosomes and kidney were significantly increased compared with samples from control virus-injected mice; however, no viral DNA was detected in the kidney. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that overexpression of miR-23a/27a in muscle prevents diabetes-induced muscle cachexia and attenuates renal fibrosis lesions via muscle-kidney crosstalk. Further, this crosstalk involves movement of miR potentially through muscle originated exosomes and serum distribution without movement of AAV. These results could provide new approaches for developing therapeutic strategies for diabetic nephropathy with muscle wasting.

Oncogene	2018	Hypoxia-mediated tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance are major clinical challenges in ovarian cancer. Exosomes released in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment may contribute to these challenges by transferring signaling proteins between cancer cells and normal cells. We observed that ovarian cancer cells exposed to hypoxia significantly increased their exosome release by upregulating Rab27a, downregulating Rab7, LAMP1/2, NEU-1, and also by promoting a more secretory lysosomal phenotype. STAT3 knockdown in ovarian cancer cells reduced exosome release by altering the Rab family proteins Rab7 and Rab27a under hypoxic conditions. We also found that exosomes from patient-derived ascites ovarian cancer cell lines cultured under hypoxic conditions carried more potent oncogenic proteins-STAT3 and FAS that are capable of significantly increasing cell migration/invasion and chemo-resistance in vitro and tumor progression/metastasis in vivo. Hypoxic ovarian cancer cells derived exosomes (HEx) are proficient in re-programming the immortalized fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FT) to become pro-tumorigenic in mouse fallopian tubes. In addition, cisplatin efflux via exosomes was significantly increased in ovarian cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. Co-culture of HEx with tumor cells led to significantly decreased dsDNA damage and increased cell survival in response to cisplatin treatment. Blocking exosome release by known inhibitor Amiloride or STAT3 inhibitor and treating with cisplatin resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis, decreased colony formation, and proliferation. Our results demonstrate that HEx are more potent in augmenting metastasis/chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer and may serve as a novel mechanism for tumor metastasis, chemo-resistance, and a point of intervention for improving clinical outcomes.

Biochim Biophys Acta	2018	Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) alterations in age-related macular degeneration occur in patches, potentially involving long-distance communication between damaged and healthy areas. Communication along the epithelium might be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs). To test this hypothesis, EVs were collected from supernatants of polarized ARPE-19 and primary porcine RPE monolayers for functional and biochemical assays. EVs from oxidatively stressed donor cells reduced barrier function in recipient RPE monolayers when compared to control EVs. The effect on barrier function was dependent on EV uptake, which occurred rapidly with EVs from oxidatively stressed donor cells. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of EVs identified HDAC6, which is known to reduce tight junction stability. Activity assays confirmed the presence of HDAC6 in EVs, and EV transfer assays using HDAC6 inhibitors confirmed its effect in monolayers. These findings demonstrate that EVs can communicate stress messages to healthy RPE cells, potentially contributing to RPE dysfunction.

Biosens Bioelectron	2018	Exosomes are natural spherical phospholipids vesicles derived from cells. Dropping MCF-7 exosome (with high biomarkers as exosomal case) covalently onto the SCPE-GNP causes the sensor to be stable due to the electrochemical induction of positive charges of different biomarkers with [Fe(CN)6] -3/-4 reactions. In the following, the covalent p19 connection with the biomarkers of exosome turns off the sensor. After adding the hybrid of miR21-probe, its tight coupling to p19 has reestablished the system. As a result, this sensor has been able to detect miR21 with high sensitivity and specificity. For the first time, the exosomal electrochemical properties were proven as the electrochemical amplifier bed. The limit of detection (LOD) was 1 a.M. due to the existence of various biomarkers for connecting covalent to p19. Electrochemical impedance (EIS) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) are used for miR sensing on the MCF-7 exosome-p19 composite. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Ultraviolet Visible (UV) spectroscopic techniques are used to understand the interactions between each layer. These vesicles can be used as a natural source for biocompatible devices that are used in transfection using an electrochemical method at a cost-effective and high-performance basis.

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2018	Exosomes are membrane nanovesicles implicated in cell-to-cell signaling in which they transfer their molecular cargo from the parent to the recipient cells. This role essentially depends on the exosomes' small size, which is the prerequisite for their rapid migration through the crowded extracellular matrix and into and out of circulation. Here we report much lower exosome mobility than expected from the size of their vesicles, implicate membrane proteins in a substantially impeded rate of migration, and suggest an approach to quantifying the impact. The broadly distributed excess hydrodynamic resistance provided by surface proteins produces a highly heterogeneous and microenvironment-dependent hindrance to exosome motility. The implications of the findings on exosome-mediated signaling are discussed.

Hum Immunol	2003	Tumor cells release membrane vesicles, named exosomes, capable of specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation by transferring tumor antigens to dendritic cells. By contrast, the nonclassical human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-G class I molecule displays immunotolerant properties and can be ectopically expressed by tumor cells, thereby allowing their escape from immunosurveillance. We describe here that a melanoma cell line, named Fon, established from an HLA-G-positive melanoma biopsy, spontaneously expressed high levels of the HLA-G1 membrane-bound isoform. Exosomes released by Fon cells were purified and analyzed both for their density on sucrose gradient and their protein composition by Western blotting and flow cytometry. Besides the expression of well-described proteins such as Lamp-2, notably, these melanoma-derived exosomes bore HLA-G1. In addition, exosomes harboring HLA-G1 were secreted by the HLA-G-negative M8 melanoma cells transfected with the HLA-G1 cDNA. Thus, the presence of tolerogenic HLA-G molecules on melanoma-derived exosomes may provide a novel way for tumors to modulate host's immune response.

The immunogenicity of dendritic cell-derived exosomes.	Blood Cells Mol Dis	2005 Sep-Oct	Exosome production represents an alternate endocytic pathway for secretion. Multivesicular endosomes (MVE) fuse with the plasma membrane expelling internal vesicles or exosomes from cells. Exosome production has been recently described for immune cells including B cells, dendritic cells (DC), mast cells, macrophages and T cells. Exosomes derived from some DC populations stimulate T lymphocyte proliferation in vitro and have potent capacity to generate anti-tumour immune responses in vivo. These reported studies have involved in vitro grown mature DC expanded from precursors with cytokines. However, immature DC produce higher numbers of exosomes than mature DC and this is thought to be due to a reduction in endocytosis as DC mature, associated with reduced reformation of MVE and reduced exosome formation. This lab pioneered a method to generate immature DC in spleen long-term cultures (LTC). DC produced in cultures represent immature myeloid DC, highly endocytic but with weak capacity to stimulate T cells. LTC-DC produce exosomes and contain many MVE. This prompted a study of immunogenic potential with a view to the potential use of exosomes in vaccination and immunotherapy. DC produced in cultures represent immature myeloid DC, highly endocytic but with weak capacity to stimulate T cells. Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation from LTC-DC and shown by marker expression to arise by budding from the LAMP-1+ limiting endosomal membrane of MVE. These LTC-derived exosomes appear however to lack immunostimulatory markers like CD86, CD40, MHC-I and MHC-II. While LTC-DC can stimulate antigen-specific proliferation of CD4+ T cells, exosome preparations derived from antigen-pulsed DC were unable to stimulate purified naïve T cells in vitro. They were however found to weakly activate allogeneic CD8+ T cells in vitro. Tumour antigen-pulsed LTC-DC or their exosomes could induce a protective response in mice against growth of a transplanted tumour but could not induce a response to clear an existing tumour. Exosomes derived from immature DC can modulate immune responses, but do not function in direct T cell activation in vitro. Modulation of immune responses by exosomes produced by immature DC may be dependent on the presence of other antigen presenting DC subsets in the animal. The possible function of immature DC and their exosomes in maintenance of tolerance and in the induction of immunity is discussed.

Enhanced induction of dendritic cell maturation and HLA-A*0201-restricted CEA-specific CD8(+) CTL response by exosomes derived from IL-18 gene-modified CEA-positive tumor cells.	J Mol Med (Berl)	2006	Dendritic cells (DC)-derived or tumor-derived exosomes are a population of nanometer sized membrane vesicles that can induce specific anti-tumor immunity. However, the immunogenic potential and efficiency of exosomes-based tumor vaccine are not satisfactory enough to achieve a curative effect in clinical trials. In this article we investigated whether IL-18 genetic modification of tumor cells can increase the efficacy of exosomes derived from IL-18 gene-modified tumor cells. We transfected carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing tumor cells with a recombinant adenovirus encoding human IL-18 (AdhIL-18) and prepared the exosomes, Exo/IL-18, from IL-18 gene-modified tumor cells. We found that Exo/IL-18 naturally contain CEA and bioactive IL-18. Moreover, Exo-IL-18 are potent in chemoattracting DC and T cells, enhancing the proliferation and Th1 cytokine release of PBMC, and promoting the phenotypic and functional maturation of DC. Furthermore, Exo/IL-18-pulsed DC are quite potent to induce HLA-A*0201-restricted, CEA-specific CD8(+) CTL from the PBMC of HLA-A*0201 CEA(+) cancer patients in vitro. In almost all of these experiments, Exo/IL-18 show more potent functions than the conventionally prepared exosomes derived from parent tumor cells without IL-18 gene modification. Our findings suggest that Exo/IL-18 has more potent capability to induce specific anti-tumor immunity, and our strategy of IL-18 modification of exosomes is a feasible approach to develop exosomes-based tumor vaccines.

Exosomes released from macrophages infected with intracellular pathogens stimulate a proinflammatory response in vitro and in vivo.	Blood	2007	Intracellular pathogens and the molecules they express have limited contact with the immune system. Here, we show that macrophages infected with intracellular pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M bovis BCG, Salmonella typhimurium, or Toxoplasma gondii release from cells small vesicles known as exosomes which contain pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These exosomes, when exposed to uninfected macrophages, stimulate a proinflammatory response in a Toll-like receptor- and myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent manner. Further, exosomes isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of M bovis BCG-infected mice contain the mycobacteria components lipoarabinomannan and the 19-kDa lipoprotein and can stimulate TNF-alpha production in naive macrophages. Moreover, exosomes isolated from M bovis BCG- and M tuberculosis-infected macrophages, when injected intranasally into mice, stimulate TNF-alpha and IL-12 production as well as neutrophil and macrophage recruitment in the lung. These studies identify a previously unknown function for exosomes in promoting intercellular communication during an immune response to intracellular pathogens, and we hypothesize that extracellular release of exosomes containing PAMPs is an important mechanism of immune surveillance.

Enrichment of prion protein in exosomes derived from ovine cerebral spinal fluid.	Vet Immunol Immunopathol	2008	Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and a wide variety of animal species including sheep and cattle. The transmissible agent, the prion, is an abnormally folded form (PrP(Sc)) of the host encoded cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). Distribution of the prion protein in the fluids of species susceptible to these diseases is of importance to human health and the iatrogenic spread of prion disease. Aside from blood which is confirmed to be a source of prion infectivity, it is currently unclear which other body fluids harbor a significant transmission risk. In the current study we examined two ovine fluids; pseudo-afferent lymph and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), for the presence of exosomes and concurrent enrichment of the normal, cellular form of the prion protein (PrP(C)). Here we demonstrate the existence of exosomes in both pseudo-afferent lymph and CSF isolated from sheep. In the CSF derived exosomes we were able to show an enrichment of PrP(C) over unfractionated CSF. This experimental approach suggests that CSF derived exosomes could be used as a novel means of detecting abnormal forms of the prion protein and provide an in vivo link between these vesicles and prion disease pathogenesis.

J Am Soc Nephrol	2009	Proteins associated with autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (polycystin-1, polycystin-2, and fibrocystin) localize to various subcellular compartments, but their functional site is thought to be on primary cilia. PC1+ vesicles surround cilia in Pkhd1(del2/del2) mice, which led us to analyze these structures in detail. We subfractionated urinary exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) and isolated a subpopulation abundant in polycystin-1, fibrocystin (in their cleaved forms), and polycystin-2. This removed Tamm-Horsfall protein, the major contaminant, and subfractionated ELVs into at least three different populations, demarcated by the presence of aquaporin-2, polycystin-1, and podocin. Proteomic analysis of PKD ELVs identified 552 proteins (232 not yet in urinary proteomic databases), many of which have been implicated in signaling, including the molecule Smoothened. We also detected two other protein products of genes involved in cystic disease: Cystin, the product of the mouse cpk locus, and ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6, the product of the human Bardet-Biedl syndrome gene (BBS3). Our proteomic analysis confirmed that cleavage of polycystin-1 and fibrocystin occurs in vivo, in manners consistent with cleavage at the GPS site in polycystin-1 and the proprotein convertase site in fibrocystin. In vitro, these PKD ELVs preferentially interacted with primary cilia of kidney and biliary epithelial cells in a rapid and highly specific manner. These data suggest that PKD proteins are shed in membrane particles in the urine, and these particles interact with primary cilia.	PMC2637052

Adipose tissue exosome-like vesicles mediate activation of macrophage-induced insulin resistance.	Diabetes	2009	OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) released from adipose tissue play a role in activation of macrophages and subsequent development of insulin resistance in a mouse model. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: ELVs released from adipose tissue were purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation and labeled with green fluorescent dye and then intravenously injected into B6 ob/ob mice (obese model) or B6 mice fed a high-fat diet. The effects of injected ELVs on the activation of macrophages were determined through analysis of activation markers by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and induction of inflammatory cytokines using an ELISA. Glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were also evaluated. Similarly, B6 mice with different gene knockouts including TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, and Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-beta (TRIF) were also used for testing their responses to the injected ELVs. RESULTS: ELVs are taken up by peripheral blood monocytes, which then differentiate into activated macrophages with increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Injection of obELVs into wild-type C57BL/6 mice results in the development of insulin resistance. When the obELVs were intravenously injected into TLR4 knockout B6 mice, the levels of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were much lower. RBP4 is enriched in the obELVs. Bone marrow-derived macrophages preincubated with recombinant RBP4 led to attenuation of obELV-mediated induction of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. CONCLUSIONS: ELVs released by adipose tissue can act as a mode of communication between adipose tissues and macrophages. The obELV-mediated induction of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in macrophages and insulin resistance requires the TLR4/TRIF pathway.	PMC2768161

Secretory mechanisms and intercellular transfer of microRNAs in living cells.	J Biol Chem	2010	The existence of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the blood of cancer patients has raised the possibility that miRNAs may serve as a novel diagnostic marker. However, the secretory mechanism and biological function of extracellular miRNAs remain unclear. Here, we show that miRNAs are released through a ceramide-dependent secretory machinery and that the secretory miRNAs are transferable and functional in the recipient cells. Ceramide, whose biosynthesis is regulated by neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), triggers secretion of small membrane vesicles called exosomes. The decreased activity of nSMase2 with a chemical inhibitor, GW4869, and a specific small interfering RNA resulted in the reduced secretion of miRNAs. Complementarily, overexpression of nSMase2 increased extracellular amounts of miRNAs. We also revealed that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport system is unnecessary for the release of miRNAs. Furthermore, a tumor-suppressive miRNA secreted via this pathway was transported between cells and exerted gene silencing in the recipient cells, thereby leading to cell growth inhibition. Our findings shed a ray of light on the physiological relevance of secretory miRNAs.	PMC2878508

Glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored interleukin-2 expressed on tumor-derived exosomes induces antitumor immune response in vitro.	Tumori	2010 May-Jun	AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs) have been considered as a new kind of cancer vaccine, but the antitumor effects are not satisfactory. In order to improve the efficacy of TEXs, we investigated whether exosomes derived from glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored interleukin 2 (GPI-IL-2) gene-modified bladder cancer cells can increase the antitumor effects. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We transfected melanoma antigen-1 (MAGE-1)-expressing T24 tumor cells with a plasmid encoding GPI-IL-2 and prepared the TEXs. Exosomes expressing GPI-IL-2 were characterized by electron microscope and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: IL-2 was present on the cell surface in the GPI-anchored form as demonstrated by fluorescent microscope and ELISA analyses. Exosomes expressing GPI-IL-2 naturally contained bioactive GPI-IL-2 and tumor-associated antigen MAGE-1. Moreover, exosomes expressing GPI-IL-2-pulsed dendritic cells could induce the proliferation of T cells and the antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immune response more efficiently. CONCLUSIONS: GPI-IL-2 gene-modified tumor cells can make the TEXs contain GPI-IL-2, resulting in increased antitumor effects. Our study provided a feasible approach for exosome-based tumor immunotherapy.

Clin Cancer Res	2011	Exosomes are small (30 to 100 nm) membrane-bound particles that are released from normal, diseased, and neoplastic cells and are present in blood and other bodily fluids. Exosomes contain a variety of molecules including signal peptides, mRNA, microRNA, and lipids. Exosomes can function to export from cells unneeded endogenous molecules and therapeutic drugs. When exosomes are taken up by specific cells, they may act locally to provide autocrine or paracrine signals or, at a distance, as a newly described nanoparticle-based endocrine system. Specifically, mRNA transferred to cells by exosomes can result in the production of new proteins. In cancer, signals via exosomes affect the immune system by inhibiting the functions of T cells and normal killer (NK) cells and by inhibiting the differentiation of precursors to mature antigen-presenting cells. Also, exosomes increase the number and/or activity of immune suppressor cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells, T-regulatory cells, and CD14(+), HLA-DR(-/low) cells. The effects of exosomes on the development and progression of cancers, with an emphasis on suppression of immune surveillance, is described. Also discussed are potential uses of exosomes clinically, in the development of vaccines, in targeting tumors, and in diagnosis and/or early detection.	PMC3155407

Role of exosomes released by chronic myelogenous leukemia cells in angiogenesis.	Int J Cancer	2012	Our study is designed to assess if exosomes released from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells may modulate angiogenesis. We have isolated and characterized the exosomes generated from LAMA84 CML cells and demonstrated that addition of exosomes to human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) induces an increase of both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 cell adhesion molecules and interleukin-8 expression. The stimulation of cell-cell adhesion molecules was paralleled by a dose-dependent increase of adhesion of CML cells to a HUVEC monolayer. We further showed that the treatment with exosomes from CML cells caused an increase in endothelial cell motility accompanied by a loss of VE-cadherin and β-catenin from the endothelial cell surface. Functional characterization of exosomes isolated from CML patients confirmed the data obtained with exosomes derived from CML cell line. CML exosomes caused reorganization into tubes of HUVEC cells cultured on Matrigel. When added to Matrigel plugs in vivo, exosomes induced ingrowth of murine endothelial cells and vascularization of the Matrigel plugs. Our results suggest for the first time that exosomes released from CML cells directly affect endothelial cells modulating the process of neovascularization.	PMC3236253

Exosomal transmission of functional aquaporin 2 in kidney cortical collecting duct cells.	J Physiol	2011	Exosomes are vesicles released following fusion of endosomes with the plasma membrane. Urine contains exosomes that are released from the entire length of the nephron and change in composition with kidney disease. Exosomes can shuttle information between non-renal cells via transfer of protein and RNA. In this study murine kidney collecting duct (mCCDC11) cells were used to demonstrate that exosomes can act as a signalling mechanism between cells. First, the release of exosomes by mCCDC11 cells was confirmed by multiple approaches. Following isopynic centrifugation, exosomal proteins flotillin-1 and TSG101 were identified in fractions consistent with exosomes. Electron microscopy demonstrated structures consistent in size and shape with exosomes. Exposure of mCCDC11 cells to the synthetic vasopressin analogue, desmopressin, did not affect exosomal flotillin-1 or TSG101 but increased aquaporin 2 (AQP2) in a dose- and time-dependent manner that was highly correlated with cellular AQP2 (exosomal AQP2 vs. cellular AQP2, Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.93). To test whether the ratio of exosomal AQP2/flotillin-1 is under physiological control in vivo, rats were treated with desmopressin. The ratio of AQP2/flotillin-1 in the urinary exosome was significantly increased. Inter-cellular signalling by exosomes was demonstrated: exosomes from desmopressin-treated cells stimulated both AQP2 expression and water transport in untreated mCCDc11 cells (water flow across cells: control exosome treatment 52.8 ± 11 μl cm(-2); AQP2-containing exosomes 77.4 ± 4 μl cm(-2), P = 0.05, n = 4). In summary, the amount of AQP2 in exosomes released from collecting duct cells is physiologically regulated and exosomal AQP2 closely reflects cellular expression. Exosomes can transfer functional AQP2 between cells and this represents a novel physiological mechanism for cell-to-cell communication within the kidney.	PMC3286690

A multiplex quantitative proteomics strategy for protein biomarker studies in urinary exosomes.	Kidney Int	2012	Urinary exosomes have received considerable attention as a potential biomarker source for the diagnosis of renal diseases. Notwithstanding, their use in protein biomarker research is hampered by the lack of efficient methods for vesicle isolation, lysis, and protein quantification. Here we report an improved ultracentrifugation-based method that facilitates the solubilization and removal of major impurities associated with urinary exosomes. A double-cushion sucrose/D(2)O centrifugation step was used after a two-step differential centrifugation to separate exosomes from the heavier vesicles. After the removal of uromodulin, 378 and 79 unique proteins were identified, respectively, in low- and high-density fractions. Comparison of our data with two previously published data sets helped to define proteins commonly found in urinary exosomes. Lysis, protein extraction, and in-solution digestion of exosomes were then optimized for MudPIT application. More than a hundred exosomal proteins were quantified by four-plex iTRAQ analysis of single and pooled samples from two different age groups. For healthy men, six proteins (TSN1, PODXL, IDHC, PPAP, ACBP, and ANXA5) showed significant expression differences between exosome pools of those aged 25-50 and 50-70 years old. Thus, exosomes isolated by our method provide the basis for the development of robust quantitative methods for protein biomarker research.

Front Physiol	2012	Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles, which stem from endosomes fusing with the plasma membrane, and can be recaptured by receiving cells. They contain lipids, proteins, and RNAs able to modify the physiology of receiving cells. Functioning of the brain relies on intercellular communication between neural cells. These communications can modulate the strength of responses at sparse groups of specific synapses, to modulate circuits underlying associations and memory. Expression of new genes must then follow to stabilize the long-term modifications of the synaptic response. Local changes of the physiology of synapses from one neuron driven by another, have so far been explained by classical signal transduction to modulate transcription, translation, and posttranslational modifications. In vitro evidence now demonstrates that exosomes are released by neurons in a way depending on synaptic activity; these exosomes can be retaken by other neurons suggesting a novel way for inter-neuronal communication. The efficacy of inter-neuronal transfer of biochemical information allowed by exosomes would be far superior to that of direct cell-to-cell contacts or secreted soluble factors. Indeed, lipids, proteins, and RNAs contained in exosomes secreted by emitting neurons could directly modify signal transduction and protein expression in receiving cells. Exosomes could thus represent an ideal mechanism for inter-neuronal transfer of information allowing anterograde and retrograde signaling across synapses necessary for plasticity. They might also allow spreading across the nervous system of pathological proteins like PrPsc, APP fragments, phosphorylated Tau, or Alpha-synuclein.	PMC3361079

Tolerance induction by exosomes from immature dendritic cells and rapamycin in a mouse cardiac allograft model.	PLoS One	2012	BACKGROUND: Dendritic cells (DCs) release bioactive exosomes that play an important role in immune regulation. Because they express low levels of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and co-stimulatory molecules, exosomes derived from donor immature DCs (imDex) prolong allograft survival by inhibiting T-cell activation. However, this effect is limited and does not induce immunological tolerance when imDex are administered alone. Thus, we tested the effect of combined treatment with donor imDex and low-dose rapamycin on inducing tolerance in a mouse cardiac transplantation model. METHODS: ImDex were obtained from the culture supernatant of immature DCs derived from donor mouse (C57BL/6) bone marrow and were injected with suboptimal doses of rapamycin into recipient mouse (BALB/c) before and after transplantation. The capacity of this treatment to induce immune tolerance was analyzed in vitro and in vivo using the mouse cardiac transplantation model. RESULTS: Donor imDex expressed moderate levels of MHC class II and low levels of MHC class I and co-stimulatory molecules, but neither imDex nor subtherapeutic rapamycin dose alone induced cardiac allograft tolerance. Combined treatment with imDex and rapamycin, however, led to donor specific cardiac allograft tolerance. This effect was accompanied by decreased anti-donor antigen cellular response and an increased percentage of spleen CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells in recipients. Furthermore, this donor specific tolerance could be further transferred to naïve allograft recipients through injection of splenocytes, but not serum, from tolerant recipients. CONCLUSION: Combined with immunosuppressive treatment, donor imDex can prolong cardiac allograft survival and induce donor specific allograft tolerance.	PMC3430614

Clinical impact of serum exosomal microRNA-21 as a clinical biomarker in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	Cancer	2013	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are 40-nm to 100-nm membrane vesicles that are secreted by various cells, and they play a major role in cell-cell communication. The objective of this study was to clarify the significance of the levels of microRNA in exosomes extracted from the sera of patients with esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). METHODS: The authors isolated exosomes in serum samples from patients who had ESCC and from patients who had benign diseases without systemic inflammation. Total RNA was purified from the exosomes, and expression levels of microRNA-21 (miR-21) were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Serum exosomes from patients with ESCC induced the proliferation of ESCC cells in vitro. The expression levels of exosomal miR-21 were significantly higher in patients with ESCC than those with benign diseases with and without (C-reactive protein <0.3 mg/dL) systemic inflammation. MiR-21 was not detected in serum that remained after exosome extraction. Exosomal miR-21 expression was correlated with advanced tumor classification, positive lymph node status, and the presence of metastasis with inflammation or and clinical stage without inflammation (C-reactive protein <0.3 mg/dL). CONCLUSIONS: The current results confirmed that exosomal miR-21 expression is up-regulated in serum from patients with ESCC versus serum from patients who have benign diseases without systemic inflammation. Exosomal miR-21 was positively correlated with tumor progression and aggressiveness, suggesting that it may be a useful target for cancer therapy. Cancer 2013. © 2012 American Cancer Society.

Exosome-like nanoparticles from intestinal mucosal cells carry prostaglandin E2 and suppress activation of liver NKT cells.	J Immunol	2013	Regulation and induction of anergy in NKT cells of the liver can inhibit autoimmune and antitumor responses by mechanisms that are poorly understood. We investigated the effects of PGE2, delivered by intestinal, mucus-derived, exosome-like nanoparticles (IDENs), on NKT cells in mice. In this study, we demonstrate that IDENs migrate to the liver where they induce NKT cell anergy. These effects were mediated by an IDENs' PGE2. Blocking PGE2 synthesis attenuated IDENs inhibition of induction of IFN-γ and IL-4 by α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer)-stimulated liver NKT cells in a PGE2 E-type prostanoid 2/E-type prostanoid 4 receptor-mediated manner. Proinflammatory conditions enhanced the migration of IDENs to the liver where α-GalCer and PGE2 induced NKT anergy in response to subsequent α-GalCer stimulation. These findings demonstrate that IDENs carrying PGE2 can be transferred from the intestine to the liver, where they act as immune modulators, inducing an anergic-like state of NKT cells. These reagents might be developed as therapeutics for autoimmune liver diseases.	PMC4396634

Immunomodulatory impact of leishmania-induced macrophage exosomes: a comparative proteomic and functional analysis.	PLoS Negl Trop Dis	2013	Released by many eukaryotic cells, the exosomes are 40-100 nm vesicles shown to operate over the complex processes of cell-cell communication. Among the metazoan cell lineages known to generate exosomes is the mononuclear phagocyte lineage, a lineage that parasites such as Leishmania are known to subvert as host cells. We previously reported that mouse macrophage signaling and functions are modified once co-incubated with exoproteome of Leishmania promastigotes. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we were curious to further compare the content of purified exosomes released by the J774 mouse macrophage cell line exposed or not to either LPS or to stationary phase Leishmania mexicana promastigotes. Collectively, our analyses resulted in detection of 248 proteins, ∼50-80% of which were shared among the three sources studied. Using exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) and network analyses, we found that the macrophage exosomes display unique signatures with respect to composition and abundance of many functional groups of proteins, such as plasma membrane-associated proteins, chaperones and metabolic enzymes. Moreover, for the first time, L. mexicana surface protease GP63 is shown to be present in exosomes released from J774 macrophages exposed to stationary phase promastigotes. We observed that macrophage exosomes are able to induce signaling molecules and transcription factors in naive macrophages. Finally, using qRT-PCR, we monitored modulation of expression of multiple immune-related genes within macrophages exposed to exosomes. We found all three groups of exosomes to induce expression of immune-related genes, the ones collected from macrophages exposed to L. mexicana sharing properties with exosomes collected from macrophage left unexposed to any agonist. Overall, our results allowed depicting that protein sorting into macrophage-derived exosomes depends upon the cell status and how such distinct protein sorting can in turn impact the functions of naive J774 cells.

PLoS One	2013	Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are critical processes in fetal circulation and placental vasculature development. Placental mesenchymal stem cells (pMSC) are known to release paracrine factors (some of which are contained within exosomes) that promote angiogenesis and cell migration. The aims of this study were: to determine the effects of oxygen tension on the release of exosomes from pMSC; and to establish the effects of pMSC-derived exosomes on the migration and angiogenic tube formation of placental microvascular endothelial cells (hPMEC). pMSC were isolated from placental villi (8-12 weeks of gestation, n = 6) and cultured under an atmosphere of 1%, 3% or 8% O2. Cell-conditioned media were collected and exosomes (exo-pMSC) isolated by differential and buoyant density centrifugation. The dose effect (5-20 µg exosomal protein/ml) of pMSC-derived exosomes on hPMEC migration and tube formation were established using a real-time, live-cell imaging system (Incucyte™). The exosome pellet was resuspended in PBS and protein content was established by mass spectrometry (MS). Protein function and canonical pathways were identified using the PANTHER program and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, respectively. Exo-pMSC were identified, by electron microscopy, as spherical vesicles, with a typical cup-shape and diameters around of 100 nm and positive for exosome markers: CD63, CD9 and CD81. Under hypoxic conditions (1% and 3% O2) exo-pMSC released increased by 3.3 and 6.7 folds, respectively, when compared to the controls (8% O2; p<0.01). Exo-pMSC increased hPMEC migration by 1.6 fold compared to the control (p<0.05) and increased hPMEC tube formation by 7.2 fold (p<0.05). MS analysis identified 390 different proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, development, immunomodulatory, and cell-to-cell communication. The data obtained support the hypothesis that pMSC-derived exosomes may contribute to placental vascular adaptation to low oxygen tension under both physiological and pathological conditions.

Transmembrane prostatic acid phosphatase (TMPAP) interacts with snapin and deficient mice develop prostate adenocarcinoma.	PLoS One	2013	The molecular mechanisms underlying prostate carcinogenesis are poorly understood. Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), a prostatic epithelial secretion marker, has been linked to prostate cancer since the 1930's. However, the contribution of PAP to the disease remains controversial. We have previously cloned and described two isoforms of this protein, a secretory (sPAP) and a transmembrane type-I (TMPAP). The goal in this work was to understand the physiological function of TMPAP in the prostate. We conducted histological, ultra-structural and genome-wide analyses of the prostate of our PAP-deficient mouse model (PAP(-/-)) with C57BL/6J background. The PAP(-/-) mouse prostate showed the development of slow-growing non-metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. In order to find out the mechanism behind, we identified PAP-interacting proteins byyeast two-hybrid assays and a clear result was obtained for the interaction of PAP with snapin, a SNARE-associated protein which binds Snap25 facilitating the vesicular membrane fusion process. We confirmed this interaction by co-localization studies in TMPAP-transfected LNCaP cells (TMPAP/LNCaP cells) and in vivo FRET analyses in transient transfected LNCaP cells. The differential gene expression analyses revealed the dysregulation of the same genes known to be related to synaptic vesicular traffic. Both TMPAP and snapin were detected in isolated exosomes. Our results suggest that TMPAP is involved in endo-/exocytosis and disturbed vesicular traffic is a hallmark of prostate adenocarcinoma.	PMC3769315

Exosomes released by islet-derived mesenchymal stem cells trigger autoimmune responses in NOD mice.	Diabetes	2014	Exosomes (EXOs) are secreted, nano-sized membrane vesicles that contain potent immunostimulatory materials. We have recently demonstrated that insulinoma-released EXOs can stimulate the autoimmune responses in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a spontaneous disease model for type 1 diabetes. To investigate whether primary islet cells can produce EXOs, we isolated cells from the islet of Langerhans of NOD mice and cultured them in vitro. Interestingly, cultured islets release fibroblast-like, fast-replicating cells that express mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers, including CD105 and stem-cell antigen-1. These islet MSC-like cells release highly immunostimulatory EXOs that could activate autoreactive B and T cells endogenously primed in NOD mice. Serum EXO levels and EXO-induced interferon-γ production were positively correlated with disease progression at the early prediabetic stage. Consistent with these observations, immunohistological analysis of pancreata showed that CD105(+) cells are restricted to the peri-islet area in normal islets but penetrate into the β-cell area as lymphocyte infiltration occurs. Immunization with EXOs promoted expansion of transferred diabetogenic T cells and accelerated the effector T cell-mediated destruction of islets. Thus, EXOs could be the autoantigen carrier with potent adjuvant activities and may function as the autoimmune trigger in NOD mice.	PMC3931393

Exosomes secreted under hypoxia enhance invasiveness and stemness of prostate cancer cells by targeting adherens junction molecules.	Mol Carcinog	2015	Hypoxic conditions in prostate cancer (PCA) are associated with poor prognosis; however, precise mechanism/s through which hypoxia promotes malignant phenotype remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the role of exosomes from hypoxic PCA cells in enhancing the invasiveness and stemness of naïve PCA cells, as well as in promoting cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype in prostate stromal cells (PrSC). Human PCA LNCaP and PC3 cells were exposed to hypoxic (1% O2 ) or normoxic (21% O2 ) conditions, and exosomes secreted under hypoxic (Exo(Hypoxic) ) and normoxic (Exo(Normoxic) ) conditions were isolated from conditioned media. Nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed that Exo(Hypoxic) have smaller average size as compared to Exo(Normoxic) . Immunoblotting results showed a higher level of tetraspanins (CD63 and CD81), heat shock proteins (HSP90 and HSP70), and Annexin II in Exo(Hypoxic) compared to Exo(Normoxic) . Co-culturing with Exo(Hypoxic) increased the invasiveness and motility of naïve LNCaP and PC3 cells, respectively. Exo(Hypoxic) also promoted prostasphere formation by both LNCaP and PC3 cells, and enhanced α-SMA (a CAF biomarker) expression in PrSC. Compared to Exo(Normoxic) , Exo(Hypoxic) showed higher metalloproteinases activity and increased level of diverse signaling molecules (TGF-β2, TNF1α, IL6, TSG101, Akt, ILK1, and β-catenin). Furthermore, proteome analysis revealed a higher number of proteins in Exo(Hypoxic) (160 proteins) compared to Exo(Normoxic) (62 proteins), primarily associated with the remodeling of epithelial adherens junction pathway. Importantly, Exo(Hypoxic) targeted the expression of adherens junction proteins in naïve PC3 cells. These findings suggest that Exo(Hypoxic) are loaded with unique proteins that could enhance invasiveness, stemness, and induce microenvironment changes; thereby, promoting PCA aggressiveness.

24452836	Hisashi Sakamaki	Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan;			Posttransplantation bone marrow assessment by quantifying hematopoietic cell-derived mRNAs in plasma exosomes/microvesicles.	Clin Chem	2014	BACKGROUND: Bone marrow (BM) aspiration often can be a painful medical procedure. It is unavoidable, however, because hematopoietic precursor cells (HPC) exist only in BM and few escape to peripheral blood (PB). We hypothesized that HPCs might release exosomes and microvesicles (EMV) in BM, and the resulting EMV would penetrate into PB. Such BM-derived EMV might be identified in PB by measuring specific mRNAs produced by HPC. METHODS: Human plasma was applied to an EMV-capture filter plate. After centrifugation, captured EMV were lysed on the filter plate. Resulting lysates were transferred to an oligo(dT)-immobilized microplate for mRNA isolation followed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Using this system, myeloid-, erythroid-, and megakaryocyte-lineage-specific poly(A)(+) mRNAs were quantified in plasma obtained from 18 patients who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). RESULTS: When fluorescent liposomes were applied to the filter plate, more than 95% of applied liposomes were absorbed. When human plasma was applied, a scanning electron microscope showed EMV-like particles on the membrane of the filter plate. After RT-PCR, various HPC-specific mRNAs were detected, and the results were equivalent to those derived from the standard ultracentrifugation method. The levels of these mRNAs were undetectable after HSCT and became detectable 1-2 weeks after HSCT, a substantially earlier time point than with traditional hematological analysis. The recovery of EMV mRNA at day 15 corresponded to the final clinical outcome at day 180. CONCLUSIONS: HPC-derived mRNAs in plasma EMV may represent new biomarkers for the assessment of BM condition and could reduce the necessity for frequent BM aspiration.

PLoS One	2014	Microvesicles and exosomes are nanoparticles released from cells and can contain small RNAs, mRNA and proteins that affect cells at distant sites. In sheep, endogenous beta retroviruses (enJSRVs) are expressed in the endometrial epithelia of the uterus and can be transferred to the conceptus trophectoderm. One potential mechanism of enJSRVs transfer from the uterus to the conceptus is via exosomes/microvesicles. Therefore, studies were conducted to evaluate exosomes in the uterine luminal fluid (ULF) of sheep. Exosomes/microvesicles (hereafter referred to as extracellular vesicles) were isolated from the ULF of day 14 cyclic and pregnant ewes using ExoQuick-TC. Transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis found the isolates contained vesicles that ranged from 50 to 200 nm in diameter. The isolated extracellular vesicles were positive for two common markers of exosomes (CD63 and HSP70) by Western blot analysis. Proteins in the extracellular vesicles were determined by mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis. Extracellular vesicle RNA was analyzed for small RNAs by sequencing and enJSRVs RNA by RT-PCR. The ULF extracellular vesicles contained a large number of small RNAs and miRNAs including 81 conserved mature miRNAs. Cyclic and pregnant ULF extracellular vesicles contained enJSRVs env and gag RNAs that could be delivered to heterologous cells in vitro. These studies support the hypothesis that ULF extracellular vesicles can deliver enJSRVs RNA to the conceptus, which is important as enJSRVs regulate conceptus trophectoderm development. Importantly, these studies support the idea that extracellular vesicles containing select miRNAs, RNAs and proteins are present in the ULF and likely have a biological role in conceptus-endometrial interactions important for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy.

Plasma exosomes as markers of therapeutic response in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.	Front Immunol	2014	PURPOSE: Exosomes isolated from the plasma of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients have elevated protein and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) contents and inhibit natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity (Haematologica 96, p. 1302, 2011). A potential role of exosomes in predicting responses to chemotherapy (CT) was evaluated in AML patients undergoing treatment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Plasma was obtained from AML patients at diagnosis (n = 16); post-induction CT (n = 9); during consolidation CT (n = 10); in long-term remission (Lt-CR, n = 5); and from healthy volunteers (n = 7). Exosomes were isolated by size-exclusion chromatography and ultracentrifugation. The exosomal protein, soluble TGFβ-1 levels (ELISA), and the TGF-β1 profiles (western blots) were compared among patients' cohorts. The results were correlated with the patients' cytogenetic profile, percentage of leukemic blast, and outcome. RESULTS: At diagnosis, protein and TGF-β1 levels were higher (p < 0.009 and p < 0.004) in AML than control exosomes. These values decreased after induction CT (p < 0.05 and p < 0.004), increased during consolidation CT (p < 0.02 and p < 0.005), and normalized in Lt-CR. While TGF-β1 and protein levels tracked one another, TGF-β1 pro-peptide, latency-associated peptide (LAP), or mature TGF-β1 differentially decorated exosomes isolated before, during, and after CT. Only TGF-β1 pro-peptide was seen in exosomes of controls or Lt-CR patients. During consolidation CT, exosomes carried TGF-β1 pro-peptide, LAP, and low levels of mature TGF-β1. NK cell co-incubation with AML exosomes carrying all three TGF-β1 forms induced down-regulation of NKG2D expression. CONCLUSION: Changes in exosomal protein and/or TGF-β1 content may reflect responses to CT. The exosomal profile may suggest the presence of residual disease in patients considered to have achieved complete remission.	PMC3989594

Electronic address: .	tochiya@ncc.go.jp		Intercellular communication by extracellular vesicles and their microRNAs in asthma.	Clin Ther	2014	PURPOSE: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes and microvesicles are phospholipid bilayer-enclosed vesicles that are recognized as novel tools for intercellular communications and as biomarkers for several diseases. They contain various DNAs, proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) that have potential diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Their biological roles have attracted significant interest in the pulmonary field because their vesicle composition and miRNA content have the ability to transfer biological information to recipient cells and play an important role in pulmonary inflammatory and allergic diseases. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, and it is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms and reversible airflow obstruction. The purpose of this review was to discuss the function of EVs and their miRNAs in asthma, with a focus on the biological properties and biogenesis of EVs, their pathophysiologic roles, and their potential use as biomarkers and therapies for asthma. METHODS: We review the findings from several articles on EVs and their miRNAs in asthma and provide illustrative references. FINDINGS: A few studies have reported on the biological function of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid-derived EVs in asthmatic progression. In the lungs, EVs might regulate airway inflammation and allergic reactions through their paracrine effects. Furthermore, circulating miRNAs have been found to be associated with EVs. IMPLICATION: EV-mediated miRNAs can be used as biomarkers in asthma.

PLoS One	2014	Mendelian laws provide the universal founding paradigm for the mechanism of genetic inheritance through which characters are segregated and assorted. In recent years, however, parallel with the rapid growth of epigenetic studies, cases of inheritance deviating from Mendelian patterns have emerged. Growing studies underscore phenotypic variations and increased risk of pathologies that are transgenerationally inherited in a non-Mendelian fashion in the absence of any classically identifiable mutation or predisposing genetic lesion in the genome of individuals who develop the disease. Non-Mendelian inheritance is most often transmitted through the germline in consequence of primary events occurring in somatic cells, implying soma-to-germline transmission of information. While studies of sperm cells suggest that epigenetic variations can potentially underlie phenotypic alterations across generations, no instance of transmission of DNA- or RNA-mediated information from somatic to germ cells has been reported as yet. To address these issues, we have now generated a mouse model xenografted with human melanoma cells stably expressing EGFP-encoding plasmid. We find that EGFP RNA is released from the xenografted human cells into the bloodstream and eventually in spermatozoa of the mice. Tumor-released EGFP RNA is associated with an extracellular fraction processed for exosome purification and expressing exosomal markers, in all steps of the process, from the xenografted cancer cells to the spermatozoa of the recipient animals, strongly suggesting that exosomes are the carriers of a flow of information from somatic cells to gametes. Together, these results indicate that somatic RNA is transferred to sperm cells, which can therefore act as the final recipients of somatic cell-derived information.	PMC4081593

However, biological function of exosomal ncRNA remains unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the prognostic and diagnostic values of exosomal ncRNA by comparing the amounts of exosomal miR-21 and HOTAIR in serum of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) patients with those of polyps of vocal cords, and by determinating whether combined detection of the two molecules could provide useful information in the diagnosis of LSCC. Exosomes were isolated from the serum samples of 52 LSCC patients and those of 49 patients with polyps of vocal cords. TEM and Western blot were applied for the confirmation of isolated exosomes by observing the ultra structure and testing CD63 marker protein, respectively. RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of miR-21 and HOTAIR in the exosomes. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated to examine the prognostic value of the two molecules. The expression of exosomal miR-21 and HOTAIR was significantly higher in patients with LSCC than those with vocal cord polyps. There were significant differences of serum exosomal miR-21 and HOTAIR expressions between the advanced T classifications (T3/T4) or clinical stages (III/IV) and the early stages. The patients with lymph node metastasis had higher serum exosomal miR-21 and HOTAIR expressions than those without. There were no differences between patient sex, tumor locations and differentiations. The area under the ROC curve of combined examination of exosomal HOTAIR and miR-21 for diagnosing LSCC was 87.6 %, which was significantly higher than 80.1 % of miR-21 (p = 0.0359) or 72.7 % of HOTAIR (p = 0.0012), showing 94.2 and 73.5 % of sensitivity and specificity, respectively, in differentiating the malignant from benign laryngeal disease. Serum exosomal miR-21 and HOTAIR were significantly correlated with clinical parameters of LSCC, and combined evaluation of their serum expressions may be a valuable biomarker to screen LSCC and might be a promising predicting tool for LSCC patient.

Electronic address: .	d.pegtel@vumc.nl		Nontemplated nucleotide additions distinguish the small RNA composition in cells from exosomes.	Cell Rep	2014	Functional biomolecules, including small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), are released and transmitted between mammalian cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs), including endosome-derived exosomes. The small RNA composition in cells differs from exosomes, but underlying mechanisms have not been established. We generated small RNA profiles by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from a panel of human B cells and their secreted exosomes. A comprehensive bioinformatics and statistical analysis revealed nonrandomly distributed subsets of microRNA (miRNA) species between B cells and exosomes. Unexpectedly, 3' end adenylated miRNAs are relatively enriched in cells, whereas 3' end uridylated isoforms appear overrepresented in exosomes, as validated in naturally occurring EVs isolated from human urine samples. Collectively, our findings suggest that posttranscriptional modifications, notably 3' end adenylation and uridylation, exert opposing effects that may contribute, at least in part, to direct ncRNA sorting into EVs.

J Extracell Vesicles	2014	Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles of endocytic origin released into the extracellular space upon fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. Exosomes represent a novel mechanism of cell-cell communication allowing direct transfer of proteins, lipids and RNAs. In the nervous system, both glial and neuronal cells secrete exosomes in a way regulated by glutamate. It has been hypothesized that exosomes can be used for interneuronal communication implying that neuronal exosomes should bind to other neurons with some kind of specificity. Here, dissociated hippocampal cells were used to compare the specificity of binding of exosomes secreted by neuroblastoma cells to that of exosomes secreted by cortical neurons. We found that exosomes from neuroblastoma cells bind indiscriminately to neurons and glial cells and could be endocytosed preferentially by glial cells. In contrast, exosomes secreted from stimulated cortical neurons bound to and were endocytosed only by neurons. Thus, our results demonstrate for the first time that exosomes released upon synaptic activation do not bind to glial cells but selectively to other neurons suggesting that they can underlie a novel aspect of interneuronal communication.

Exp Eye Res	2015	The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab is widely used off-label for the treatment of various ocular diseases, most commonly in age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Bevacizumab is able to penetrate the retina and is found in the choroid after intravitreal injection in a time dependent manner. It has previously been shown to be taken up by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In this study, we have investigated the intracellular pathway following uptake of bevacizumab in RPE cells, tested both in primary porcine RPE cells and in the human cell line ARPE19. Bevacizumab displays a characteristic, time-dependent pattern of intracellular distribution, as detected by immunofluorescence and pulse chase experiments. In both primary cells and the cell line, intracellular bevacizumab can be found after seven days, as detected by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Immediately after application, bevacizumab partially colocalizes with Rab5, indicating some uptake in early endosomes. Intracellularly, bevacizumab is detected in the cytoskeletal fraction, aligning with actin filaments, as revealed by subcellular fractioning and immunofluorescence. Bevacizumab seems to travel along actin filaments by myosin7a, as determined by triple staining immunofluorescence. Interestingly, over a period of seven days, bevacizumab seems to accumulate in certain storage areas, as observed by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, results obtained with immunocytochemistry, Western blotting and flow cytometry indicate that bevacizumab may be released from the RPE cells via exosomes. In conclusion, bevacizumab is taken up by and transported in the retinal pigment epithelial cells in a characteristic, time-dependent manner, where it seems to move along actin filaments by myosin7a and seem to be partially released from the cells via exosomes.

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	Previous studies using B16BL6-derived exosomes labelled with gLuc-lactadherin (gLuc-LA), a fusion protein of Gaussia luciferase (a reporter protein) and lactadherin (an exosome-tropic protein), showed that the exosomes quickly disappeared from the systemic circulation after intravenous injection in mice. In the present study, the mechanism of rapid clearance of intravenously injected B16BL6 exosomes was investigated. gLuc-LA-labelled exosomes were obtained from supernatant of B16BL6 cells after transfection with a plasmid DNA encoding gLuc-LA. Labelling was stable when the exosomes were incubated in serum. By using B16BL6 exosomes labelled with PKH26, a lipophilic fluorescent dye, it was demonstrated that PKH26-labelled B16BL6 exosomes were taken up by macrophages in the liver and spleen but not in the lung, while PKH26-labelled exosomes were taken up by the endothelial cells in the lung. Subsequently, gLuc-LA-labelled B16BL6 exosomes were injected into macrophage-depleted mice prepared by injection with clodronate-containing liposomes. The clearance of the intravenously injected B16BL6 exosomes from the blood circulation was much slower in macrophage-depleted mice than that in untreated mice. These results indicate that macrophages play important roles in the clearance of intravenously injected B16BL6 exosomes from the systemic circulation.	PMC4323410

Endothelial exosomes contribute to the antitumor response during breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy via microRNA transfer.	Oncotarget	2015	The interaction between tumor cells and their microenvironment is an essential aspect of tumor development. Therefore, understanding how this microenvironment communicates with tumor cells is crucial for the development of new anti-cancer therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that inhibit gene expression. They are secreted into the extracellular medium in vesicles called exosomes, which allow communication between cells via the transfer of their cargo. Consequently, we hypothesized that circulating endothelial miRNAs could be transferred to tumor cells and modify their phenotype. Using exogenous miRNA, we demonstrated that endothelial cells can transfer miRNA to tumor cells via exosomes. Using miRNA profiling, we identified miR-503, which exhibited downregulated levels in exosomes released from endothelial cells cultured under tumoral conditions. The modulation of miR-503 in breast cancer cells altered their proliferative and invasive capacities. We then identified two targets of miR-503, CCND2 and CCND3. Moreover, we measured increased plasmatic miR-503 in breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which could be partly due to increased miRNA secretion by endothelial cells. Taken together, our data are the first to reveal the involvement of the endothelium in the modulation of tumor development via the secretion of circulating miR-503 in response to chemotherapy treatment.

Circulation	2015	BACKGROUND: Whether biomechanical force on the heart can induce exosome secretion to modulate cardiovascular function is not known. We investigated the secretion and activity of exosomes containing a key receptor in cardiovascular function, the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R). METHODS AND RESULTS: Exosomes containing AT1Rs were isolated from the media overlying AT1R-overexpressing cells exposed to osmotic stretch and from sera of mice undergoing cardiac pressure overload. The presence of AT1Rs in exosomes was confirmed by both electron microscopy and radioligand receptor binding assays and shown to require β-arrestin2, a multifunctional adaptor protein essential for receptor trafficking. We show that functional AT1Rs are transferred via exosomes in an in vitro model of cellular stretch. Using mice with global and cardiomyocyte conditional deletion of β-arrestin2, we show that under conditions of in vivo pressure overload the cellular source of the exocytosis of exosomes containing AT1R is the cardiomyocyte. Exogenously administered AT1R-enriched exosomes target cardiomyocytes, skeletal myocytes, and mesenteric resistance vessels and are sufficient to confer blood pressure responsiveness to angiotensin II infusion in AT1R knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: AT1R-enriched exosomes are released from the heart under conditions of in vivo cellular stress to likely modulate vascular responses to neurohormonal stimulation. In the context of the whole organism, the concept of G protein-coupled receptor trafficking should consider circulating exosomes as part of the reservoir of functional AT1Rs.	PMC4470842

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	Exosomes, membrane vesicles of 40-100 nm in diameter, are derived from endosomes in various cells. The bioactive molecules specifically packed into exosomes can be horizontally transferred into recipient cells changing their biological properties, by which tumour cells continuously modify their surrounding microenvironment and distant target cells favouring cancer metastasis. It has been suspected for a long time that exosomes participate in the whole process of tumour metastasis. Although there is much unknown and many controversies in the role of cancer exosome, the major contribution of tumour-associated exosomes to different steps of cancer metastasis are demonstrated in this review. Mainly because these exosomes are easily accessible and capable of representing their parental cells, exosomes draw much attention as a promising biomarker for tumour screening, diagnosis and prognosis. Currently, researchers have found numerous biomarkers in exosomes with great potential to be utilized in personalized medicine. In this article, we summarize the roles of biomarkers, which are validated by clinical samples. Even though many conundrums remain, such as exosome extraction, large multicentre validation of biomarkers and data interpretation, exosomes are certain to be used in clinical practice in the near future as the field rapidly expands.

Hierarchical paracrine interaction of breast cancer associated fibroblasts with cancer cells via hMAPK-microRNAs to drive ER-negative breast cancer phenotype.	Cancer Biol Ther	2015	Multiple juxtacrine and paracrine interactions occur between cancer cells and non-cancer cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that direct tumor progression. Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) are an integral component of the TME, and the majority of breast tumor stroma is comprised of CAFs. Heterotypic interactions between cancer cells and non-cancer cells of the TME occur via soluble agents, including cytokines, hormones, growth factors, and secreted microRNAs. We previously identified a microRNA signature indicative of hyperactive MAPK signaling (hMAPK-miRNA signature) that significantly associated with reduced recurrence-free and overall survival. Here we report that the hMAPK-miRNA signature associates with a high metric of stromal cell infiltrate, and we investigate the role of microRNAs, particularly hMAPK-microRNAs, secreted by CAFs on estrogen receptor (ER) expression in breast cancer cells. ER-positive MCF-7/ltE2- cells were treated with conditioned media (CM) from CAFs derived from breast cancers of different PAM50 subtypes (CAFBAS, CAFHER2, and CAFLA). CAF CM isolated specifically from ER-negative primary breast tumors led to ER repression in vitro. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of CAF-secreted exosomes in CM and the uptake of these exosomes by the ER+ MCF-7/ltE2- cells. Differentially expressed microRNAs in CAF CM as well as in MCF-7/ltE2- cells treated with this CM were identified. Knockdown of miR-221/222 in CAFBAS resulted in knockdown of miR221/222 levels in the conditioned media and the CM from CAFBAS; miR221/222 knockdown rescued ER repression in ER-positive cell lines treated with CAFBAS-CM. Collectively, our results demonstrate that CAF-secreted microRNAs are directly involved in ER-repression, and may contribute to the MAPK-induced ER repression in breast cancer cells.	PMC4846097

Time-dependent release of extracellular vesicle subpopulations in tumor CABA I cells.	Oncol Rep	2015	Investigations into extracellular vesicles (EVs) have significantly increased since their role in physiological and pathological processes has become more clearly understood. Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear that several subpopulations of EVs exist, such as exosomes (EXOs) and microvesicles (MVs). Various methods and techniques used to identify and isolate the specific EVs subpopulations exist. However, these methods should be further elucidated. A deep understanding of the different factors that affect the EVs release may therefore be useful for the standardization of protocols and to establish guidelines for a more adequate analysis and correct inter‑laboratory comparison. In the present study, we investigated whether composition and molecular features of EVs altered over time following a trigger stimulus. Starved CABA I cells were stimulated with FBS and conditioned medium was collected after different time intervals (30 min and 4, 8 and 18 h). The dynamic of EVs release was time-dependent, as shown by the results of scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, the time elapsed from the stimulus affected the size distribution (as highlighted by transmission electron microscopy and NanoSight assay), amount (in terms of the number of particles and protein amount) and molecular composition (CD63, HLA, Ago-2, gelatinases, and plasminogen activators) suggesting that, different EVs subpopulations were released at different time intervals following cell stimulation. Collectively, the results suggested that, parameters useful to standardize procedures for EVs isolation, including stimulation time should be considered.

Extracellular Vesicles from Caveolin-Enriched Microdomains Regulate Hyaluronan-Mediated Sustained Vascular Integrity.	Int J Cell Biol	2015	Defects in vascular integrity are an initiating factor in several disease processes. We have previously reported that high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA), a major glycosaminoglycan in the body, promotes rapid signal transduction in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVEC) leading to barrier enhancement. In contrast, low molecular weight hyaluronan (LMW-HA), produced in disease states by hyaluronidases and reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces HPMVEC barrier disruption. However, the mechanism(s) of sustained barrier regulation by HA are poorly defined. Our results indicate that long-term (6-24 hours) exposure of HMW-HA induced release of a novel type of extracellular vesicle from HLMVEC called enlargeosomes (characterized by AHNAK expression) while LMW-HA long-term exposure promoted release of exosomes (characterized by CD9, CD63, and CD81 expression). These effects were blocked by inhibiting caveolin-enriched microdomain (CEM) formation. Further, inhibiting enlargeosome release by annexin II siRNA attenuated the sustained barrier enhancing effects of HMW-HA. Finally, exposure of isolated enlargeosomes to HPMVEC monolayers generated barrier enhancement while exosomes led to barrier disruption. Taken together, these results suggest that differential release of extracellular vesicles from CEM modulate the sustained HPMVEC barrier regulation by HMW-HA and LMW-HA. HMW-HA-induced specialized enlargeosomes can be a potential therapeutic strategy for diseases involving impaired vascular integrity.	PMC4581561

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2015	Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) has been identified as a telomere-associated regulator of chromosome end protection. Here, we report that TERRA can also be found in extracellular fractions that stimulate innate immune signaling. We identified extracellular forms of TERRA in mouse tumor and embryonic brain tissue, as well as in human tissue culture cell lines using RNA in situ hybridization. RNA-seq analyses revealed TERRA to be among the most highly represented transcripts in extracellular fractions derived from both normal and cancer patient blood plasma. Cell-free TERRA (cfTERRA) could be isolated from the exosome fractions derived from human lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) culture media. cfTERRA is a shorter form (∼200 nt) of cellular TERRA and copurifies with CD63- and CD83-positive exosome vesicles that could be visualized by cyro-electron microscopy. These fractions were also enriched for histone proteins that physically associate with TERRA in extracellular ChIP assays. Incubation of cfTERRA-containing exosomes with peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated transcription of several inflammatory cytokine genes, including TNFα, IL6, and C-X-C chemokine 10 (CXCL10) Exosomes engineered with elevated TERRA or liposomes with synthetic TERRA further stimulated inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that exosome-associated TERRA augments innate immune signaling. These findings imply a previously unidentified extrinsic function for TERRA and a mechanism of communication between telomeres and innate immune signals in tissue and tumor microenvironments.

Methods Mol Biol	2016	Cancer diagnosis and therapy is steadily improving. Still, diagnosis is frequently late and diagnosis and follow-up procedures mostly are time-consuming and expensive. Searching for tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) in body fluids may provide an alternative, minimally invasive, yet highly reliable diagnostic tool. Beyond this, there is strong evidence that TEX could become a potent therapeutics. Exosomes, small vesicles delivered by many cells of the organism, are found in all body fluids. Exosomes are characterized by lipid composition, common and donor cell specific proteins, mRNA, small non-coding RNA including miRNA and DNA. Particularly the protein and miRNA markers received much attention as they may allow for highly specific diagnosis and can provide hints toward tumor aggressiveness and progression, where exosome-based diagnosis and follow-up is greatly facilitated by the recovery of exosomes in body fluids, particularly the peripheral blood. Beyond this, exosomes are the most important intercellular communicators that modulate, instruct, and reprogram their surrounding as well as distant organs. In concern about TEX this includes message transfer from tumor cells toward the tumor stroma, the premetastatic niche, the hematopoietic system and, last but not least, the instruction of non-cancer stem cells by cancer-initiating cells (CIC). Taking this into account, it becomes obvious that "tailored" exosomes offer themselves as potent therapeutic delivery system. In brief, during the last 4-5 years there is an ever-increasing, overwhelming interest in exosome research. This boom appears fully justified provided the content of the exosomes becomes most thoroughly analyzed and their mode of intercellular interaction can be unraveled in detail as this knowledge will open new doors toward cancer diagnosis and therapy including immunotherapy and CIC reprogramming.

J Biol Chem	2016	Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released by cells and play important roles in intercellular communication and pathogen transfer. Exosomes have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including prion disease and Alzheimer disease. Prion disease arises upon misfolding of the normal cellular prion protein, PrP(C), into the disease-associated isoform, PrP(Sc). The disease has a unique transmissible etiology, and exosomes represent a novel and efficient method for prion transmission. The precise mechanism by which prions are transmitted from cell to cell remains to be fully elucidated, although three hypotheses have been proposed: direct cell-cell contact, tunneling nanotubes, and exosomes. Given the reported presence of exosomes in biological fluids and in the lipid and nucleic acid contents of exosomes, these vesicles represent an ideal mechanism for encapsulating prions and potential cofactors to facilitate prion transmission. This study investigates the relationship between exosome release and intercellular prion dissemination. Stimulation of exosome release through treatment with an ionophore, monensin, revealed a corresponding increase in intercellular transfer of prion infectivity. Conversely, inhibition of exosome release using GW4869 to target the neutral sphingomyelinase pathway induced a decrease in intercellular prion transmission. Further examination of the effect of monensin on PrP conversion revealed that monensin also alters the conformational stability of PrP(C), leading to increased generation of proteinase K-resistant prion protein. The findings presented here provide support for a positive relationship between exosome release and intercellular transfer of prion infectivity, highlighting an integral role for exosomes in facilitating the unique transmissible nature of prions.

Mol Neurobiol	2017	Changes in circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been associated with different neurological diseases. Here, we presented results of a pilot study aimed at determining the feasibility of detecting miRNAs in the CSF of Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) infected individuals with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). We demonstrated the circulating miRNA profile in CSF of acute encephalitis patients infected with JEV. Using a quantitative real-time PCR-based miRNA array, we examined the level of 87 miRNAs expressed in human exosomes isolated from CSF. Subsequently, correlation between cytokine level and miRNAs expression in CSF samples was examined. In this study, we identified and validated the upregulated expression of three miRNAs, miR-21-5p, miR-150-5p, and miR-342-3p that were specifically circulated in CSF of acute encephalitis patients infected with JEV. CSF miR-21-5p, miR-150-5p, and miR-342-3p expressions were also elevated in infected mice brain. However, the expression pattern of these miRNAs differed in neuronal cells, microglial cells, and the exosome derived from JEV-infected cell culture supernatant. Interestingly, neuronal cells infected with vaccine strain (SA-14-14) did not lead to any upregulation of these three miRNAs. Further, miR-150-5p expression was found to be negatively correlated(r = -0.5279, p = 0.016) with TNFα level. Pathway analysis of putative target genes of these miRNAs indicated involvement of TGF-β, NGF, axon guidance, and MAPK signaling pathways in JEV/AES patients. This study for the first time represents the circulating miRNA in CSF of AES patients and identified the upregulated miRNAs in JEV-infected patients and offers the basis for future investigation.

Protection of Nerve Injury with Exosome Extracted from Mesenchymal Stem Cell.	Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao	2016	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effect of Exosomes from human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) in neural injury induced by glutamate and its possible mechanism. METHODS: Characteristics of Exosomes from hAMSCs were identified by electron microscopy and Western blot analysis. Cytokines that might play a major role in the protective effect were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protective action of Exosome and its possible signaling pathway were researched by the in vitro neural injury induced by glutamate, including control group (without Glu), Glu group (dealing with Glu), Glu+Exo group (dealing with Glu +100 ng/ml Exo), Glu+Exo+Akt group (dealing with Glu+100 ng/ml Exo+10 μmol/L Akt), Glu+Exo+Erk group (dealing with 100 ng/ml Glu+100 ng/ml Exo+10 μmol/L Erk), and Glu+Exo+TrkB group (dealing with Glu+100 ng/ml Exo +10 μmol/L TrkB). RESULTS: Exosomes from hAMSCs had similar sizes to those isolated from other kinds of cells, and expressed the characteristic proteins such as CD63, CD81, HSP70, and HSP90. Cytokines that had neurotrophic effects on Exosomes were mainly insulin-like growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor, with the concentration being 9336.49±258.63 and 58,645.50±16,014.62, respectively; brain derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor,and vascular endothelial growth factor had lower levels, with the concentration being 1928.25±385.47, 1136.94±5.99, and 33.34±9.43, respectively. MTS assay showed that the PC12 cell survival rates were 0.842±0.047, 0.306±0.024, 0.566±0.026, 0.461±0.016, 0.497±0.003, and 0.515±0.034 in the control group, Glu group, Glu+Exo group, Glu+Exo+Akt group, Glu+Exo+Erk group, and Glu+Exo+TrkB group; obviously, it was significantly lower in Glu group than in control group (P=0.02), significantly higher in Glu+Exo group than in Glu group (P=0.01), and significantly lower in Glu+Exo+Akt group than in Glu+Exo group (P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Exosomes secreted from hAMSCs have protective effect against neuron damage induced by glutamate, which may be mediated through activating the PI3/K-Akt signalling pathway.

Gap junction-mediated transfer of miR-145-5p from microvascular endothelial cells to colon cancer cells inhibits angiogenesis.	Oncotarget	2016	Gap junctional communication between cancer cells and blood capillary cells is crucial to tumor growth and invasion. Gap junctions may transfer microRNAs (miRs) among cells. Here, we explore the impact of such a transfer in co-culture assays, using the antitumor miR-145 as an example. The SW480 colon carcinoma cells form functional gap junction composed of connexin-43 (Cx43) with human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC). When HMEC are loaded with miR-145-5p mimics, the miR-145 level drastically increases in SW480. The functional inhibition of gap junctions, using either a gap channel blocker or siRNA targeting Cx43, prevents this increase. The transfer of miR-145 also occurs from SW480 to HMEC but not in non-contact co-cultures, excluding the involvement of soluble exosomes. The miR-145 transfer to SW480 up-regulates their Cx43 expression and inhibits their ability to promote angiogenesis. Our results indicate that the gap junctional communication can inhibit tumor growth by transferring miRs from one endothelial cell to neighboring tumor cells. This "bystander" effect could find application in cancer therapy.	PMC5053717
27144529	Leileata M Russo	Exosome Diagnostics, Inc. New York, New York, United States of America.			Urine Exosomes for Non-Invasive Assessment of Gene Expression and Mutations of Prostate Cancer.	PLoS One	2016	PURPOSE: The analysis of exosome/microvesicle (extracellular vesicles (EVs)) and the RNA packaged within them (exoRNA) has the potential to provide a non-invasive platform to detect and monitor disease related gene expression potentially in lieu of more invasive procedures such as biopsy. However, few studies have tested the diagnostic potential of EV analysis in humans. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The ability of EV analysis to accurately reflect prostate tissue mRNA expression was examined by comparing urinary EV TMPRSS2:ERG exoRNA from pre-radical prostatectomy (RP) patients versus corresponding RP tissue in 21 patients. To examine the differential expression of TMPRSS2:ERG across patient groups a random urine sample was taken without prostate massage from a cohort of 207 men including prostate biopsy negative (Bx Neg, n = 39), prostate biopsy positive (Bx Pos, n = 47), post-radical prostatectomy (post-RP, n = 37), un-biopsied healthy age-matched men (No Bx, n = 44), and young male controls (Cont, n = 40). The use of EVs was also examined as a potential platform to non-invasively differentiate Bx Pos versus Bx Neg patients via the detection of known prostate cancer genes TMPRSS2:ERG, BIRC5, ERG, PCA3 and TMPRSS2. RESULTS: In this technical pilot study urinary EVs had a sensitivity: 81% (13/16), specificity: 80% (4/5) and an overall accuracy: 81% (17/21) for non-invasive detection of TMPRSS2:ERG versus RP tissue. The rate of TMPRSS2:ERG exoRNA detection was found to increase with age and the expression level correlated with Bx Pos status. Receiver operator characteristic analyses demonstrated that various cancer-related genes could differentiate Bx Pos from Bx Neg patients using exoRNA isolated from urinary EVs: BIRC5 (AUC 0.674 (CI:0.560-0.788), ERG (AUC 0.785 (CI:0.680-0.890), PCA3 (AUC 0.681 (CI:0.567-0.795), TMPRSS2:ERG (AUC 0.744 (CI:0.600-0.888), and TMPRSS2 (AUC 0.637 (CI:0.519-0.754). CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that urinary EVs have the potential to be used as a platform to non-invasively differentiate patients with prostate cancer with very good accuracy. Larger studies are needed to confirm the potential for clinical utility.	PMC4856378

Cell Physiol Biochem	2016	BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is difficult to predict acute thrombotic cardiovascular events in the clinic. Few studies have reported the presence of plasma exosomes containing microRNAs (miRNAs) in cardiovascular events. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the levels of miR-223, miR-339 and miR-21 in plasma exosomes before thrombosis in mouse models of carotid tandem stenosis, as well as the mechanisms underlying the origin and function of these exosomal miRNAs. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from the carotid tandem stenosis and sham control groups of our successfully developed atherothrombosis mouse models before thrombosis. Platelets from healthy volunteers and mice were purified to obtain thrombin stimulated platelet-derived exosomes. Exosomes were isolated via differential ultracentrifugation, and western blotting and transmission electron microscopy were used for their identification. The total RNA was extracted, and quantitative real-time PCR was performed to determine the expression levels of miR-223, miR-339 and miR-21. DAVID Tools were used to analyze the pathways that were enriched among the miRNA target genes. Immuno-fluorescence staining was performed to identify the protein expression levels of platelet-derived exosome target genes in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The levels of miR-223, miR-339 and miR-21, which are associated with platelet activation, were elevated in pooled mouse plasma exosomes before thrombosis and enriched in thrombin-stimulated platelet-derived exosomes in vitro. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRβ) was a target of these miRNAs, and PDGFRβ expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was inhibited following incubation with platelet-derived exosomes. Platelet-derived exosomes could also inhibit PDGF-stimulated SMC proliferation. Furthermore, a decrease in PDGFRβ expression was observed in vascular SMCs around thrombotic areas in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that activated platelet-derived exosomes containing miR-223, miR-339 and miR-21 could be transferred into SMCs and inhibit PDGFRβ expression; these exosomal miRNAs may be a biomarker for predicting atherothrombosis.

Methods Mol Biol	2016	Exosomes are cell-derived small extracellular membrane vesicles (50-100 nm in diameter) actively secreted by a number of healthy and diseased cell types. Exosomes can mediate cellular, tissue, and organ level micro communication under normal and pathological conditions by shuttling proteins, mRNA, and microRNAs. Prior to vesicle molecular profiling, these exosomes can be isolated from conditioned cell media or bodily fluids such as urine and plasma in order to explore the contents and functional relevance. Exosome purification and analyses are a fast-growing research field. Regardless of several advances in exosome purification and analyses methods, research still faces several challenges. Despite tremendous interest in the role of extracellular vesicles, there is no general agreement on dependable isolation protocols. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish reliable protocol of exosome purification and analysis. Here, we report a simple cost-effective isolation and analysis of cardiac myocyte exosomes from conditioned media.	PMC5693424

Prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia with neuronally derived blood exosome protein profile.	Alzheimers Dement (Amst)	2016	INTRODUCTION: Levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related proteins in plasma neuronal derived exosomes (NDEs) were quantified to identify biomarkers for prediction and staging of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. METHODS: Plasma exosomes were extracted, precipitated, and enriched for neuronal source by anti-L1CAM antibody absorption. NDEs were characterized by size (Nanosight) and shape (TEM) and extracted NDE protein biomarkers were quantified by ELISAs. Plasma NDE cargo was injected into normal mice, and results were characterized by immunohistochemistry to determine pathogenic potential. RESULTS: Plasma NDE levels of P-T181-tau, P-S396-tau, and Aβ1-42 were significantly higher, whereas those of neurogranin (NRGN) and the repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) were significantly lower in AD and MCI converting to AD (ADC) patients compared to cognitively normal controls (CNC) subjects and stable MCI patients. Mice injected with plasma NDEs from ADC patients displayed increased P-tau (PHF-1 antibody)-positive cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus compared to plasma NDEs from CNC and stable MCI patients. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal plasma NDE levels of P-tau, Aβ1-42, NRGN, and REST accurately predict conversion of MCI to AD dementia. Plasma NDEs from demented patients seeded tau aggregation and induced AD-like neuropathology in normal mouse CNS.	PMC4925777

Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys	2016	PURPOSE: Early and accurate assessment of radiation injury by radiation-responsive biomarkers is critical for triage and early intervention. Biofluids such as urine and serum are convenient for such analysis. Recent research has also suggested that exosomes are a reliable source of biomarkers in disease progression. In the present study, we analyzed total urine proteome and exosomes isolated from urine or serum for potential biomarkers of acute and persistent radiation injury in mice exposed to lethal whole body irradiation (WBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: For feasibility studies, the mice were irradiated at 10.4 Gy WBI, and urine and serum samples were collected 24 and 72 hours after irradiation. Exosomes were isolated and analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry-based workflow for radiation exposure signatures. A data dependent acquisition and SWATH-MS combined workflow approach was used to identify significantly exosome biomarkers indicative of acute or persistent radiation-induced responses. For the validation studies, mice were exposed to 3, 6, 8, or 10 Gy WBI, and samples were analyzed for comparison. RESULTS: A comparison between total urine proteomics and urine exosome proteomics demonstrated that exosome proteomic analysis was superior in identifying radiation signatures. Feasibility studies identified 23 biomarkers from urine and 24 biomarkers from serum exosomes after WBI. Urinary exosome signatures identified different physiological parameters than the ones obtained in serum exosomes. Exosome signatures from urine indicated injury to the liver, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. In contrast, serum showed vascular injuries and acute inflammation in response to radiation. Selected urinary exosomal biomarkers also showed changes at lower radiation doses in validation studies. CONCLUSIONS: Exosome proteomics revealed radiation- and time-dependent protein signatures after WBI. A total of 47 differentially secreted proteins were identified in urinary and serum exosomes. Together, these data showed the feasibility of defining biomarkers that could elucidate tissue-associated and systemic response caused by high-dose ionizing radiation. This is the first report using an exosome proteomics approach to identify radiation signatures.	PMC5042854
27567840	Jϋrgen Götz				Extracellular Vesicles Containing P301L Mutant Tau Accelerate Pathological Tau Phosphorylation and Oligomer Formation but Do Not Seed Mature Neurofibrillary Tangles in ALZ17 Mice.	J Alzheimers Dis	2016	In Alzheimer's disease, the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles, a histological hallmark comprised of phosphorylated forms of the protein tau, follows a distinct pattern through anatomically connected brain regions. The well-documented correlation between the severity of tau pathology and disease progression implies a prion-like seeding and spreading mechanism for tau. Experimentally, this has been addressed in transgenic mice by the injection of protein lysates isolated from brains of transgenic mice or patients with tauopathies, including AD, that were shown to behave like seeds, accelerating tau pathology and tangle formation in predisposed mice. More specifically, in vivo data suggest that brain lysates from mice harboring the P301S mutation of tau can seed protein aggregation when injected into the hippocampi of human wild-type tau transgenic ALZ17 mice. Here, we compared the seeding potential of lysates and extracellular vesicles enriched for exosomes (EVs) from wild-type and human P301L tau transgenic rTg4510 mouse brains. We show that transgenic EVs cause increased tau phosphorylation and soluble oligomer formation in a manner comparable to that of freely available proteins in brain lysates, a prerequisite for the formation of mature protein aggregates.

Am J Pathol	2016	Pathways of liver fibrosis are controlled by connective tissue growth factor (CCN2). In this study, CCN2 was identified as a target of miR-199a-5p, which was principally expressed in quiescent mouse hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and directly suppressed production of CCN2. Up-regulated CCN2 expression in fibrotic mouse livers or in activated primary mouse HSCs was associated with miR-199a-5p down-regulation. MiR-199a-5p in quiescent mouse HSCs inhibited the activity of a wild-type CCN2 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) but not of a mutant CCN2 3'-UTR lacking the miR-199a-5p-binding site. In activated mouse HSCs, CCN2, α-smooth muscle actin, and collagen 1(α1) were suppressed by a miR-199a-5p mimic, whereas in quiescent mouse HSCs, the inhibited CCN2 3'-UTR activity was blocked by a miR-199a-5p antagomir. CCN2 3'-UTR activity in human HSCs was reduced by a miR-199a-5p mimic. MiR-199a-5p was present at higher levels in exosomes from quiescent versus activated HSCs. MiR-199a-5p-containing exosomes were shuttled from quiescent mouse HSCs to activated mouse HSCs in which CCN2 3'-UTR activity was then suppressed. Exosomes from quiescent HSCs caused miR-199a-5p-dependent inhibition of CCN2, α-smooth muscle actin, or collagen 1(α1) in activated HSCs in vitro and bound to activated HSCs in vivo. Thus, CCN2 suppression by miR-199a-5p accounts, in part, for low-level fibrogenic gene expression in quiescent HSCs and causes dampened gene expression in activated HSCs after horizontal transfer of miR-199a-5p in exosomes from quiescent HSCs.

Electronic address: .	rado.jansa5@gmail.com		Effect of shear stress in the flow through the sampling needle on concentration of nanovesicles isolated from blood.	Eur J Pharm Sci	2017	During harvesting of nanovesicles (NVs) from blood, blood cells and other particles in blood are exposed to mechanical forces which may cause activation of platelets, changes of membrane properties, cell deformation and shedding of membrane fragments. We report on the effect of shear forces imposed upon blood samples during the harvesting process, on the concentration of membrane nanovesicles in isolates from blood. Mathematical models of blood flow through the needle during sampling with vacuumtubes and with free flow were constructed, starting from the Navier-Stokes formalism. Blood was modeled as a Newtonian fluid. Work of the shear stress was calculated. In experiments, nanovesicles were isolated by repeated centrifugation (up to 17,570×g) and washing, and counted by flow cytometry. It was found that the concentration of nanovesicles in the isolates positively corresponded with the work by the shear forces in the flow of the sample through the needle. We have enhanced the effect of the shear forces by shaking the samples prior to isolation with glass beads. Imaging of isolates by scanning electron microscopy revealed closed globular structures of a similar size and shape as those obtained from unshaken plasma by repetitive centrifugation and washing. Furthermore, the sizes and shapes of NVs obtained by shaking erythrocytes corresponded to those isolated from shaken platelet-rich plasma and from unshaken platelet rich plasma, and not to those induced in erythrocytes by exogenously added amphiphiles. These results are in favor of the hypothesis that a significant pool of nanovesicles in blood isolates is created during their harvesting. The identity, shape, size and composition of NVs in isolates strongly depend on the technology of their harvesting.

Brain Behav Immun	2017	OBJECTIVE: Preterm brain injury is a major cause of disability in later life, and may result in motor, cognitive and behavioural impairment for which no treatment is currently available. The aetiology is considered as multifactorial, and one underlying key player is inflammation leading to white and grey matter injury. Extracellular vesicles secreted by mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC-EVs) have shown therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine. Here, we investigated the effects of MSC-EV treatment on brain microstructure and maturation, inflammatory processes and long-time outcome in a rodent model of inflammation-induced brain injury. METHODS: 3-Day-old Wistar rats (P3) were intraperitoneally injected with 0.25mg/kg lipopolysaccharide or saline and treated with two repetitive doses of 1×108 cell equivalents of MSC-EVs per kg bodyweight. Cellular degeneration and reactive gliosis at P5 and myelination at P11 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Long-term cognitive and motor function was assessed by behavioural testing. Diffusion tensor imaging at P125 evaluated long-term microstructural white matter alterations. RESULTS: MSC-EV treatment significantly ameliorated inflammation-induced neuronal cellular degeneration reduced microgliosis and prevented reactive astrogliosis. Short-term myelination deficits and long-term microstructural abnormalities of the white matter were restored by MSC-EV administration. Morphological effects of MSC-EV treatment resulted in improved long-lasting cognitive functions INTERPRETATION: MSC-EVs ameliorate inflammation-induced cellular damage in a rat model of preterm brain injury. MSC-EVs may serve as a novel therapeutic option by prevention of neuronal cell death, restoration of white matter microstructure, reduction of gliosis and long-term functional improvement.

Biology (Basel)	2016	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles between 30 and 100 nm in diameter secreted by many cell types, and are associated with a wide range of physiological and/or pathological processes. Exosomes containing proteins, lipids, mRNA, and microRNA contribute to cell-to-cell communication and cell-to-environment regulation, however, their biological functions are not yet fully understood. In this report, exosomes in the glioblastoma cell line, U-87MG, were isolated and the proteome was investigated. In addition, exosome proteome changes in U-87MG cells exposed to a low temperature were investigated to elucidate whether the exosome proteome could respond to an external stimulus. Cell culture medium was collected, and exosomes were isolated by continuous centrifugation eliminating cell debris, nucleic acids, and other particles. The morphology of exosomes was observed by cryo-tunneling electron microscopy. According to 2-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, certain proteins including collagen type VI alpha 1, putative RNA-binding protein 15B chain A, substrate induced remodeling of the active site regulates HTRA1, coatomer protein complex-subunit beta 2, myosin-heavy chain 1, and keratin-type I cytoskeletal 9 showed differences between the control proteome and the low temperature-exposed proteome.

Visualization of exosome-mediated miR-210 transfer from hypoxic tumor cells.	Oncotarget	2017	Cancer cells actively release exosomes carrying specific cellular components, such as proteins, mRNA, and miRNA, to communicate with various cells in the tumor microenvironment. We visualized exosome-mediated transfer of miR-210 from hypoxic breast cancer cells to neighboring cells using a miR-210 specific reporter system. By in vitro and in vivo visualization, we found that exosomes with miR-210 were transferred to cells in the tumor microenvironment and that miR-210 was involved in expression of vascular remodeling related genes, such as Ephrin A3 and PTP1B, to promote angiogenesis. These results indicate that cellular components, such as miRNAs from hypoxic cancer cells, spread to adjacent cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment via exosomes and influence tumor progression.

Hepatitis B virus X protein is capable of down-regulating protein level of host antiviral protein APOBEC3G.	Sci Rep	2017	The apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) family proteins bind RNA and single-stranded DNA, and create C-to-U base modifications through cytidine deaminase activity. APOBEC3G restricts human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection by creating hypermutations in proviral DNA, while HIV-1-encoded vif protein antagonizes such restriction by targeting APOBEC3G for degradation. APOBEC3G also inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV): APOBEC3G co-expression inhibits HBV replication and evidences exist indicating APOBEC3G-mediated HBV hypermutations in patients. HBV encodes a small non-structural X protein (HBx) with a recognized activating effect on HBV life cycle. In this work, we report the discovery that HBx selectively and dose-dependently decreases the protein level of co-expressed APOBEC3G in transfected Huh-7 cells. The effect was shown to take place post-translationally, but does not rely on protein degradation via proteasome or lysosome. Further work demonstrated that intracellular APOBEC3G is normally exported via exosome secretion and inhibition of exosome biogenesis causes retention of intracellular APOBEC3G. Finally, HBx co-expression specifically enhanced externalization of APOBEC3G via exosomes, resulting in decrease of intracellular APOBEC3G protein level. These data suggest the possibility that in addition to other mechanisms, HBx-mediated activation of HBV might also involve antagonizing of intracellular restriction factor APOBEC3G through promotion of its export.

Expression profiles and circulation dynamics of rat mesenteric lymph microRNAs.	Mol Med Rep	2017	Mesenteric lymph is vital for immune cell trafficking and intestinal fluid and chyle transport, which aid homeostatic maintenance. There have been few reports investigating the profiles and circulatory dynamics of mesenteric lymph microRNAs (miRNAs). The present study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of miRNAs in normal rodent mesenteric lymph. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR)‑based array analysis was performed to examine the expression levels of 375 miRNAs in normal rat mesenteric lymph. Using differential centrifugation, the presence of miR‑150, a representative lymph miRNA, in exosomes was assessed. Rat small intestine epithelial cell line IEC‑6‑derived exosomes were prepared from culture supernatants of cells transfected with cel‑miR‑238‑3p, and were used to trace the administered exosomes in vivo and to investigate the in vivo delivery of lymph miRNAs via mesenteric lymphatics into the systemic circulation following injection of cel‑miR‑238‑3p‑exosomes. RT‑qPCR‑based array analysis detected 287 miRNAs in lymph, and 21 miRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed between lymph and plasma. Lymph fractionation analysis demonstrated that some cell‑free lymph miR‑150 was distributed in the exosome‑containing microsomal fraction. Furthermore, in vivo analysis of lymph miRNA delivery revealed that exosomal cel‑miR‑238‑3p was markedly distributed in the lung compared with in the liver, kidney and spleen, thus indicating that the lung is the major organ responsible for clearance of exosomal lymph miRNAs. These findings provide novel insights into the modulation of gene expression by mesenteric lymph miRNAs in the lung.	PMC5365009

J Dairy Sci	2017	We sought to examine potential amino acid independent mechanisms whereby hydrolyzed whey protein (WP) affects muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and anabolism in vitro. Specifically, we tested (1) whether 3-h and 6-h treatments of WP, essential amino acids, or l-leucine (Leu) affected MPS, and whether 6-h treatments with low-, medium-, or high doses of WP versus Leu affected MPS; (2) whether knockdown of the primary Leu transporter affected WP- and Leu-mediated changes in MPS, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling responses, or both, following 6-h treatments; (3) whether exosomes isolated from WP (WP-EXO) affected MPS, mTOR signaling responses, or both, compared with untreated (control) myotubes, following 6-h, 12-h, and 24-h treatments, and whether they affected myotube diameter following 24-h and 48-h treatments. For all treatments, 7-d post-differentiated C2C12 myotubes were examined. In experiment 1, 6-h WP treatments increased MPS compared with control (+46%), Leu (+24%), and essential amino acids (+25%). Moreover, the 6-h low-, medium-, and high WP treatments increased MPS by approximately 40 to 50% more than corresponding Leu treatments. In experiment 2 (LAT short hairpin RNA-transfected myotubes), 6-h WP treatments increased MPS compared with control (+18%) and Leu (+19%). In experiment 3, WP-EXO treatments increased MPS over controls at 12h (+18%) and 24h (+45%), and myotube diameters increased with 24-h (+24%) and 48-h (+40%) WP-EXO treatments compared with controls. The WP-EXO treatments did not appear to operate through mTOR signaling; instead, they increased mRNA and protein levels o eukaryotic initiation factor 4A. Bovine-specific microRNA following 24-h WP-EXO treatments were enriched in myotubes (chiefly miR-149-3p, miR-2881), but were not related to hypertrophic gene targets. To summarize, hydrolyzed WP-EXO increased skeletal MPS and anabolism in vitro, and this may be related to an unknown mechanism that increases translation initiation factors rather than enhancing mTOR signaling or the involvement of bovine-specific microRNA.

Mol Cell Proteomics	2017	In prostate cancer and other malignancies sensitive and robust biomarkers are lacking or have relevant limitations. Prostate specific antigen (PSA), the only biomarker widely used in prostate cancer, is suffering from low specificity. Exosomes offer new perspectives in the discovery of blood-based biomarkers. Here we present a proof-of principle study for a proteomics-based identification pipeline, implementing existing data sources, to exemplarily identify exosome-based biomarker candidates in prostate cancer.Exosomes from malignant PC3 and benign PNT1A cells and from FBS-containing medium were isolated using sequential ultracentrifugation. Exosome and control samples were analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. Proteomic data is available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003651. We developed a scoring scheme to rank 64 proteins exclusively found in PC3 exosomes, integrating data from four public databases and published mass spectrometry data sets. Among the top candidates, we focused on the tight junction protein claudin 3. Retests under serum-free conditions using immunoblotting and immunogold labeling confirmed the presence of claudin 3 on PC3 exosomes. Claudin 3 levels were determined in the blood plasma of patients with localized (n = 58; 42 with Gleason score 6-7, 16 with Gleason score ≥8) and metastatic prostate cancer (n = 11) compared with patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 15) and healthy individuals (n = 15) using ELISA, without prior laborious exosome isolation. ANOVA showed different CLDN3 plasma levels in these groups (p = 0.004). CLDN3 levels were higher in patients with Gleason ≥8 tumors compared with patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (p = 0.012) and Gleason 6-7 tumors (p = 0.029). In patients with localized tumors CLDN3 levels predicted a Gleason score ≥ 8 (AUC = 0.705; p = 0.016) and did not correlate with serum PSA.By using the described workflow claudin 3 was identified and validated as a potential blood-based biomarker in prostate cancer. Furthermore this workflow could serve as a template to be used in other cancer entities.	PMC5461549

Int J Parasitol	2017	A more thorough understanding of the immunological interactions between Fasciola spp. and their hosts is required if we are to develop new immunotherapies to control fasciolosis. Deeper knowledge of the antigens that are the target of the acquired immune responses of definitive hosts against both Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica will potentially identify candidate vaccine antigens. Indonesian Thin Tail sheep express a high level of acquired immunity to infection by F. gigantica within 4weeks of infection and antibodies in Indonesian Thin Tail sera can promote antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against the surface tegument of juvenile F. gigantica in vitro. Given the high protein sequence similarity between F. hepatica and F. gigantica, we hypothesised that antibody from F. gigantica-infected sheep could be used to identify the orthologous proteins in the tegument of F. hepatica. Purified IgG from the sera of F. gigantica-infected Indonesian Thin Tail sheep collected pre-infection and 4weeks p.i. were incubated with live adult F. hepatica ex vivo and the immunosloughate (immunoprecipitate) formed was isolated and analysed via liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry to identify proteins involved in the immune response. A total of 38 proteins were identified at a significantly higher abundance in the immunosloughate using week 4 IgG, including eight predicted membrane proteins, 20 secreted proteins, nine proteins predicted to be associated with either the lysosomes, the cytoplasm or the cytoskeleton and one protein with an unknown cellular localization. Three of the membrane proteins are transporters including a multidrug resistance protein, an amino acid permease and a glucose transporter. Interestingly, a total of 21 of the 38 proteins matched with proteins recently reported to be associated with the proposed small exosome-like extracellular vesicles of adult F. hepatica, suggesting that the Indonesian Thin Tail week 4 IgG is either recognising individual proteins released from extracellular vesicles or is immunoprecipitating intact exosome-like extracellular vesicles. Five extracellular vesicle membrane proteins were identified including two proteins predicted to be associated with vesicle transport/ exocytosis (VPS4, vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4b and the Niemann-Pick C1 protein). RNAseq analysis of the developmental transcription of the 38 immunosloughate proteins showed that the sequences are expressed over a wide abundance range with 21/38 transcripts expressed at a relatively high level from metacercariae to the adult life cycle stage. A notable feature of the immunosloughates was the absence of cytosolic proteins which have been reported to be secreted markers for damage to adult flukes incubated in vitro, suggesting that the proteins observed are not inadvertent contaminants leaking from damaged flukes ex vivo. The identification of tegument protein antigens shared between F. gigantica and F. hepatica is beneficial in terms of the possible development of a dual purpose vaccine effective against both fluke species.

Mass spectrometry was used to identify the classification of miRNAs encapsulated in exosomes, and the expression levels of miRNA-21,-133a, and -181b in exosomes were detected by RT-PCR. Results: Exosomes isolated from serum of colon cancer patients were circular-or oval-shaped and vary in size with a diameter of 40-100 nm. Mass spectrometry shows that the main RNAs in exosomes are small RNAs; the levels of these small RNAs in exosomes are significantly higher compared with fresh serum. There is still a tiny amount of small RNAs in exosome-free serum, but the amounts are significantly lower than that in exosomes. No more RNAs were detected in the repeated freezing and thawing serum, but there were still some RNAs detectable in the exosomes extracted from these serums. MiRNA-21, -133a and -181b can be detected in exosomes, and the level of miRNA-21 is associated with early diagnosis of colon cancer. Conclusion: This study proves that commercial kits for exosome separation are more convenient and time-saving and that mass spectrometry is capable of identifying the miRNAs in exosomes. Compared with direct extraction of miRNAs from the serum, the method of isolating exosomes from the serum firstly and then extracting miRNAs from the exosomes can enhance the stability and integrity of their inner miRNAs. Also, we demonstrate that the exosomal miRNA-21 expression is associated with the early diagnosis of colon cancer.	PMC5463428

Circulating Exosomes Isolated from Septic Mice Induce Cardiovascular Hyperpermeability Through Promoting Podosome Cluster Formation.	Shock	2018	Septic shock increases vascular permeability, leading to multiple organ failure including cardiac dysfunction, a major contributor to septic death. Podosome, an actin-based dynamic membrane structure, plays critical roles in extracellular matrix degradation and angiogenesis. However, whether podosome contributes to endothelial barrier dysfunction during septic shock remains unknown. In this study, we found that the endothelial hyperpermeability, stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and thrombin, was accompanied by increased formation of podosome clusters at the cell periphery, indicating a positive correlation between podosome clusters and endothelial leakage. Interestingly, we observed that circulating exosomes collected from septic mice were able to stimulate podosome cluster formation in cardiac endothelial cells, together with increased permeability in vitro/in vivo and cardiac dysfunction. Mechanistically, we identified that septic exosomes contained higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than normal ones, which were effectively transported to endothelial cells (ECs). Depletion of ROS in septic exosomes significantly reduced their capacity for promoting podosome cluster formation and thereby dampened vascular leakage. Finally, we elucidated that podosome cluster-induced endothelial hyperpermeability was associated with fragmentation/depletion of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) at the cell periphery. Our results demonstrate that septic exosomes were enriched with high amounts of ROS, which can be transported to ECs, leading to the generation of podosome clusters in target ECs and thereby, causing ZO-1 relocation, vascular leakage, and cardiac dysfunction.

Sci Rep	2017	There is no available blood marker for the preoperative diagnosis of adrenocortical malignancy. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of extracellular vesicle-associated microRNAs and their diagnostic potential in plasma samples of patients suffering from adrenocortical tumors. Extracellular vesicles were isolated either by using Total Exosome Isolation Kit or by differential centrifugation/ultracentrifugation. Preoperative plasma extracellular vesicle samples of 6 adrenocortical adenomas (ACA) and 6 histologically verified adrenocortical cancer (ACC) were first screened by Taqman Human Microarray A-cards. Based on the results of screening, two miRNAs were selected and validated by targeted quantitative real-time PCR. The validation cohort included 18 ACAs and 16 ACCs. Beside RNA analysis, extracellular vesicle preparations were also assessed by transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry and dynamic light scattering. Significant overexpression of hsa-miR-101 and hsa-miR-483-5p in ACC relative to ACA samples has been validated. Receiver operator characteristics of data revealed dCT hsa-miR-483-5p normalized to cel-miR-39 to have the highest diagnostic accuracy (area under curve 0.965), the sensitivity and the specifity were 87.5 and 94.44, respectively. Extracellular vesicle-associated hsa-miR-483-5p thus appears to be a promising minimally invasive biomarker in the preoperative diagnosis of ACC but needs further validation in larger cohorts of patients.

Electronic address: .	sylvester@ulm.edu		γ-Tocotrienol-induced disruption of lipid rafts in human breast cancer cells is associated with a reduction in exosome heregulin content.	J Nutr Biochem	2017	Overexpression of heregulin, a potent ligand that activates HER3 and HER4 receptors, plays a significant role in the development of chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer patients. Exosomes released from cancer cells are small vesicles originating from the outward budding of lipid rafts that carry various mitogenic proteins that then act locally in an autocrine/paracrine manner to stimulate cancer cell growth. Since the anticancer activity of γ-tocotrienol has been shown to be mediated in part through the disruption of lipid rafts, studies were conducted to determine the effect of γ-tocotrienol on exosomes mitogenic biopotency. Exosomes isolated from the media of cultured T47D breast cancer cells were found to stimulate T47D cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. These growth stimulating effects were due to the high levels of heregulin contained in the exosomes that act to stimulate HER3 and HER4 activation, heterodimerization and mitogenic signaling. Exposure to 5 μM γ-tocotrienol resulted in the selective accumulation and disruption in the integrity of the lipid raft microdomain and a corresponding decrease in exosome heregulin content and mitogenic biopotency. These findings provide strong evidence indicating that the anticancer effects of γ-tocotrienol are mediated, at least in part, by directly disrupting HER dimerization and signaling within the lipid rafts and indirectly by reducing exosome heregulin content and subsequent autocrine/paracrine mitogenic stimulation.

Cardioprotection mediated by exosomes is impaired in the setting of type II diabetes but can be rescued by the use of non-diabetic exosomes in vitro.	J Cell Mol Med	2018	Many patients with ischaemic heart disease also have diabetes. As myocardial infarction is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in these patients, treatments that increase cell survival in response to ischaemia and reperfusion are needed. Exosomes-nano-sized, lipid vesicles released from cells-can protect the hearts of non-diabetic rats. We previously showed that exosomal HSP70 activates a cardioprotective signalling pathway in cardiomyocytes culminating in ERK1/2 and HSP27 phosphorylation. Here, we investigated whether the exosomal cardioprotective pathway remains intact in the setting of type II diabetes. Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation from non-diabetic and type II diabetic patients, from non-diabetic and Goto Kakizaki type II diabetic rats, and from normoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic endothelial cells. Exosome size and number were not significantly altered by diabetes. CD81 and HSP70 exosome markers were increased in diabetic rat exosomes. However, exosomes from diabetic rats no longer activated the ERK1/2 and HSP27 cardioprotective pathway and were no longer protective in a primary rat cardiomyocytes model of hypoxia and reoxygenation injury. Hyperglycaemic culture conditions were sufficient to impair protection by endothelial exosomes. Importantly, however, exosomes from non-diabetic rats retained the ability to protect cardiomyocytes from diabetic rats. Exosomes from diabetic plasma have lost the ability to protect cardiomyocytes, but protection can be restored with exosomes from non-diabetic plasma. These results support the concept that exosomes may be used to protect cardiomyocytes against ischaemia and reperfusion injury, even in the setting of type II diabetes.	PMC5742744

Oncotarget	2017	PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of mRNAs (C-MYC, BCL-XL, BCL-6, NF-κβ, PTEN and AKT) in exosomes of plasma as a liquid biopsy method for monitoring and prognostic evolution in B-cell lymphomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from 98 patients with B-cell Lymphoma and 68 healthy controls. mRNAs were analyzed by quantitative PCR. An additional 31 post-treatment samples were also studied. RESULTS: In the general and follicular lymphoma series, the presence of AKT mRNA was associated with poor response to rituximab-based treatment. Patients with first relapse or disease progression showed a lower percentage of PTEN and BCL-XL mRNA. The presence of BCL-6 mRNA was associated with a high death rate. The absence of PTEN mRNA in the general series, and presence of C-MYC mRNA in follicular lymphomas, were associated with short progression-free survival. BCL-6 and C-MYC mRNA were independent prognostic variables of overall survival. C-MYC mRNA may provide prognostic information with respect to overall survival. BCL-XL mRNA and increase of BCL-6 mRNA in post-treatment samples could serve as molecular monitoring markers. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large study to evaluate the prognostic and predictive values of pretreatment tumor-associated mRNA in exosomes. BCL-6 and C-MYC mRNA positivity in pretreatment samples were predictors of worse PFS compared to patients with mRNA negativity. C-MYC mRNA positivity was also a statistically significant predictor of inability to obtain complete response with first-line therapy.	PMC5584220

FASEB J	2018	Neuronal inflammation is the characteristic pathologic change of acute neurologic impairment and chronic traumatic encephalopathy after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Inhibiting the excessive inflammatory response is essential for improving the neurologic outcome. To clarify the regulatory mechanism of microglial exosomes on neuronal inflammation in TBI, we focused on studying the impact of microglial exosomal miRNAs on injured neurons in this research. We used a repetitive (r)TBI mouse model and harvested the injured brain extracts from the acute to the chronic phase of TBI to treat cultured BV2 microglia in vitro The microglial exosomes were collected for miRNA microarray analysis, which showed that the expression level of miR-124-3p increased most apparently in the miRNAs. We found that miR-124-3p promoted the anti-inflamed M2 polarization in microglia, and microglial exosomal miR-124-3p inhibited neuronal inflammation in scratch-injured neurons. Further, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling was implicated as being involved in the regulation of miR-124-3p by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses. Using the mTOR activator MHY1485 we confirmed that the inhibitory effect of exosomal miR-124-3p on neuronal inflammation was exerted by suppressing the activity of mTOR signaling. PDE4B was predicted to be the target gene of miR-124-3p by pathway analysis. We proved that it was directly targeted by miR-124-3p with a luciferase reporter assay. Using a PDE4B overexpressed lentivirus transfection system, we suggested that miR-124-3p suppressed the activity of mTOR signaling mainly through inhibiting the expression of PDE4B. In addition, exosomal miR-124-3p promoted neurite outgrowth after scratch injury, characterized by an increase on the number of neurite branches and total neurite length, and a decreased expression on RhoA and neurodegenerative proteins [Aβ-peptide and p-Tau]. It also improved the neurologic outcome and inhibited neuroinflammation in mice with rTBI. Taken together, increased miR-124-3p in microglial exosomes after TBI can inhibit neuronal inflammation and contribute to neurite outgrowth via their transfer into neurons. miR-124-3p exerted these effects by targeting PDE4B, thus inhibiting the activity of mTOR signaling. Therefore, miR-124-3p could be a promising therapeutic target for interventions of neuronal inflammation after TBI. miRNAs manipulated microglial exosomes may provide a novel therapy for TBI and other neurologic diseases.-Huang, S., Ge, X., Yu, J., Han, Z., Yin, Z., Li, Y., Chen, F., Wang, H., Zhang, J., Lei, P.

Combining Machine Learning and Nanofluidic Technology To Diagnose Pancreatic Cancer Using Exosomes.	ACS Nano	2017	Circulating exosomes contain a wealth of proteomic and genetic information, presenting an enormous opportunity in cancer diagnostics. While microfluidic approaches have been used to successfully isolate cells from complex samples, scaling these approaches for exosome isolation has been limited by the low throughput and susceptibility to clogging of nanofluidics. Moreover, the analysis of exosomal biomarkers is confounded by substantial heterogeneity between patients and within a tumor itself. To address these challenges, we developed a multichannel nanofluidic system to analyze crude clinical samples. Using this platform, we isolated exosomes from healthy and diseased murine and clinical cohorts, profiled the RNA cargo inside of these exosomes, and applied a machine learning algorithm to generate predictive panels that could identify samples derived from heterogeneous cancer-bearing individuals. Using this approach, we classified cancer and precancer mice from healthy controls, as well as pancreatic cancer patients from healthy controls, in blinded studies.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2017	The horizontal transfer of mtDNA and its role in mediating resistance to therapy and an exit from dormancy have never been investigated. Here we identified the full mitochondrial genome in circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) from patients with hormonal therapy-resistant (HTR) metastatic breast cancer. We generated xenograft models of HTR metastatic disease characterized by EVs in the peripheral circulation containing mtDNA. Moreover, these human HTR cells had acquired host-derived (murine) mtDNA promoting estrogen receptor-independent oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Functional studies identified cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived EVs (from patients and xenograft models) laden with whole genomic mtDNA as a mediator of this phenotype. Specifically, the treatment of hormone therapy (HT)-naive cells or HT-treated metabolically dormant populations with CAF-derived mtDNAhi EVs promoted an escape from metabolic quiescence and HTR disease both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, this phenotype was associated with the acquisition of EV mtDNA, especially in cancer stem-like cells, expression of EV mtRNA, and restoration of OXPHOS. In summary, we have demonstrated that the horizontal transfer of mtDNA from EVs acts as an oncogenic signal promoting an exit from dormancy of therapy-induced cancer stem-like cells and leading to endocrine therapy resistance in OXPHOS-dependent breast cancer.

Adipocyte-derived exosomes promote lung cancer metastasis by increasing MMP9 activity via transferring MMP3 to lung cancer cells.	Oncotarget	2017	Obesity is involved in tumor progression. However, the corresponding mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we report that adipocytes increase the invasive ability of tumor cells by producing exosomes with a high level of MMP3. Compared with 3T3-L1 cells, 3T3-L1 adipocytes are enriched in MMP3 protein and can transfer MMP3 to 3LL lung cancer cells. Then, MMP3 activates MMP9 activity in 3LL cells and promotes invasion in vitro and in vivo via MMP9. Furthermore, MMP3 protein levels in lung tumor tissues from obese patients are increased compared with those of non-obese patients. In addition, MMP3 protein levels are positively correlated with MMP9 activity in tumor tissues. Therefore, our results reveal a novel mechanism in the adipocyte-derived exosome-mediated promotion of lung tumor metastasis, which extends our knowledge regarding obesity and tumor progression.

Mol Neurobiol	2017	Recently, there have been emerging interests in the area of microvesicles and exosome (MV/E) released from brain cells in relation to neurodegenerative diseases. However, only limited studies focused on MV/E released post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) as they highlight on the mechanistic roles of released proteins. This study sought to examine if CSF samples from severe TBI patients contain MV/E with unique protein contents. First, nanoparticle tracking analysis determined MV/E from TBI have a mode of 74-98 nm in diameter, while control CSF MV/E have a mode of 99-104 nm. Also, there are more MV/E were isolated from TBI CSF (27.8-33.6 × 108/mL) than from control CSF (13.1-18.5 × 108/mL). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) visualization also confirmed characteristic MV/E morphology. Using targeted immunoblotting approach, we observed the presence of several known TBI biomarkers such as αII-spectrin breakdown products (BDPs), GFAP, and its BDPs and UCH-L1 in higher concentrations in MV/E from TBI CSF than their counterparts from control CSF. Furthermore, we found presynaptic terminal protein synaptophysin and known exosome marker Alix enriched in MV/E from human TBI CSF. In parallel, we conducted nRPLC-tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of two control and two TBI CSF samples. Ninety-one proteins were identified with high confidence in MV/E from control CSF, whereas 466 proteins were identified in the counterpart from TBI CSF. MV/E isolated from human CSF contain cytoskeletal proteins, neurite-outgrowth related proteins, and synaptic proteins, extracellular matrix proteins, and complement protein C1q subcomponent subunit B. Taken together, following severe TBI, the injured human brain released increased number of extracellular microvesicles/exosomes (MV/E) into CSF. These TBI MV/E contain several known TBI biomarkers and previously undescribed brain protein markers. It is also possible that such TBI-specific MV/E might contain cell to cell communication factors related to both cell death signaling a well as neurodegeneration pathways.

Electronic address: .	cjh_huaxue@126.com		A paper-supported aptasensor based on upconversion luminescence resonance energy transfer for the accessible determination of exosomes.	Biosens Bioelectron	2018	Exosomes, as potential cancer diagnostic markers have received close attention in recent years. However, there is still a lack of simple and convenient methods to detect and quantitate exosomes. Herein, we used a simple paper-supported aptasensor based on luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) from upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) to gold nanorods (Au NRs) for the accessible determination of exosomes. When exosomes are present, the two sections of the aptamer can combine with the CD63 protein on the surface of exosomes and form a conjugation to close the distance between UCNPs and Au NRs, which initiates the LRET and promotes luminescence quenching. These variations can be monitored by the homemade image system, and the green channel intensities of obtained colored images were extracted with photoshop software to quantify the luminescence. As a result, the quenching of the luminescence of the UCNPs is linearly correlated to the concentration of the exosomes (in the range of 1.0 × 104 ~ 1.0 × 108 particles/μL), enabling the detection and quantification of the exosomes. Such approach can reach a low detection limit of exosomes (1.1 × 103 particles/μL) and effectively reduce the background signal by using UCNPs as a luminescent material. This study provides an efficient and practical approach to the detection of exosomes, which should lead to point-of-care testing in clinical applications.

Amnion Epithelial Cell-Derived Exosomes Restrict Lung Injury and Enhance Endogenous Lung Repair.	Stem Cells Transl Med	2018	Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by chronic inflammation, severe scarring, and stem cell senescence. Stem cell-based therapies modulate inflammatory and fibrogenic pathways by release of soluble factors. Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles should be explored as a potential therapy for IPF. Human amnion epithelial cell-derived exosomes (hAEC Exo) were isolated and compared against human lung fibroblasts exosomes. hAEC Exo were assessed as a potential therapy for lung fibrosis. Exosomes were isolated and evaluated for their protein and miRNA cargo. Direct effects of hAEC Exo on immune cell function, including macrophage polarization, phagocytosis, neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity and T cell proliferation and uptake, were measured. Their impact on immune response, histological outcomes, and bronchioalveolar stem cell (BASC) response was assessed in vivo following bleomycin challenge in young and aged mice. hAEC Exo carry protein cargo enriched for MAPK signaling pathways, apoptotic and developmental biology pathways and miRNA enriched for PI3K-Akt, Ras, Hippo, TGFβ, and focal adhesion pathways. hAEC Exo polarized and increased macrophage phagocytosis, reduced neutrophil myeloperoxidases, and suppressed T cell proliferation directly. Intranasal instillation of 10 μg hAEC Exo 1 day following bleomycin challenge reduced lung inflammation, while treatment at day 7 improved tissue-to-airspace ratio and reduced fibrosis. Administration of hAEC Exo coincided with the proliferation of BASC. These effects were reproducible in bleomycin-challenged aged mice. The paracrine effects of hAECs can be largely attributed to their exosomes and exploitation of hAEC Exo as a therapy for IPF should be explored further.

Sci Rep	2018	Breast cancer remains the most prevalent cause of cancer mortality in woman worldwide due to the metastatic process and therapy resistance. Resistance against cancer therapy is partially attributed to cancer stem cells (CSCs). These cells arise from epithelial cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and might be responsible for tumor recurrence. In this study, we reported the relevance of miR-155 upregulation in chemoresistant cells associated with EMT. Notably, we found miR-155 induction in exosomes isolated from CSCs and resistant cells, followed by resistant cells' exosome transfer to the recipient sensitive cells. Functionally, miR-155 mimic assay showed an enrichment in miR-155 from exosome concomitant with miR-155 exosome transfer to breast cancer cells. In parallel to these effects, we also observed EMT change in miR-155 transfected cells. The chemoresistance phenotype transfer to sensitive cells and the migration capability was analyzed by MTT and scratch assays and our results suggest that exosomes may intermediate resistance and migration capacity to sensitive cells partly through exosome transfer of miR-155. Taken together, our findings establish the significance of exosome-mediate miR-155 chemoresistance in breast cancer cells, with implications for targeting miR-155 signaling as a possible therapeutic strategy.

Ann Neurol	2018	OBJECTIVE: Astrocytes fulfill neuronal trophic roles normally, but are transformed in Alzheimer disease (AD) into A1-type reactive astrocytes that may destroy neurons through unknown mechanisms. METHODS: To investigate astrocyte inflammatory mechanisms, astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) were isolated immunochemically from plasma samples of AD patients and matched controls for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification of complement proteins. RESULTS: ADE levels of C1q, C4b, C3d, factor B, factor D, Bb, C3b, and C5b-C9 terminal complement complex, but not mannose-binding lectin, normalized by the CD81 exosome marker were significantly higher for AD patients (n = 28) than age- and gender-matched controls (all p < 0.0001). ADE normalized levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-1β were significantly higher for AD patients than controls, but there was greater overlap between the two groups than for complement proteins. Mean ADE levels of complement proteins for AD patients in a longitudinal study were significantly higher (n = 16, p < 0.0001) at the AD2 stage of moderate dementia than at the AD1 preclinical stage 5 to 12 years earlier, which were the same as for controls. ADE levels of complement regulatory proteins CD59, CD46, decay-accelerating factor (DAF), and complement receptor type 1, but not factor I, were significantly lower for AD patients than controls (p < 0.0001 for CD59 and DAF), were diminished by the AD1 stage, and were further decreased at the AD2 stage. INTERPRETATION: ADE complement effector proteins in AD are produced by dysregulated systems, attain higher levels than in controls, and may potentially damage neurons in the late inflammatory phase of AD.

Cell Mol Life Sci	2018	The isolation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from blood is of great importance to understand the biological role of circulating EVs and to develop EVs as biomarkers of disease. Due to the concurrent presence of lipoprotein particles, however, blood is one of the most difficult body fluids to isolate EVs from. The aim of this study was to develop a robust method to isolate and characterise EVs from blood with minimal contamination by plasma proteins and lipoprotein particles. Plasma and serum were collected from healthy subjects, and EVs were isolated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), with most particles being present in fractions 8-12, while the bulk of the plasma proteins was present in fractions 11-28. Vesicle markers peaked in fractions 7-11; however, the same fractions also contained lipoprotein particles. The purity of EVs was improved by combining a density cushion with SEC to further separate lipoprotein particles from the vesicles, which reduced the contamination of lipoprotein particles by 100-fold. Using this novel isolation procedure, a total of 1187 proteins were identified in plasma EVs by mass spectrometry, of which several proteins are known as EV-associated proteins but have hitherto not been identified in the previous proteomic studies of plasma EVs. This study shows that SEC alone is unable to completely separate plasma EVs from lipoprotein particles. However, combining SEC with a density cushion significantly improved the separation of EVs from lipoproteins and allowed for a detailed analysis of the proteome of plasma EVs, thus making blood a viable source for EV biomarker discovery.

Electronic address: .	jingcheng.zhang@outlook.com		Colorectal cancer cell-derived exosomes containing miR-10b regulate fibroblast cells via the PI3K/Akt pathway.	Bull Cancer	2018	BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) contribute to the proliferation of colorectal cancer(CRC) cells. However, the mechanism by which CAFs develop in the tumor microenvironment remains unknown. Exosomes may be involved in activating CAFs. METHODS: Using a miRNA expression profiling array, we determined the miRNA expression profile of secretory exosomes in CRC cells and then identified potential miRNAs with significant differential expression compared to normal cells via enrichment analysis. Predicted targets of candidate miRNAs were then assessed via bioinformatics analysis. Realtime qPCR, western blot, and cell cycle analyses were performed to evaluate the role of candidate exosomal miRNAs. Luciferase reporter assays were applied to confirm whether candidate exosomal miRNAs control target pathway expression. A CRC xenograft mouse model was constructed to evaluate tumor growth in vivo. RESULTS: Exosomes from CRC cells contained significantly higher levels of miR-10b than did exosomes from normal colorectal epithelial cells. Moreover, exosomes containing miR-10b were transferred to fibroblasts. Bioinformatics analysis identified PIK3CA, as a potential target of miR-10b. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-10b directly inhibited PIK3CA expression. Co-culturing fibroblasts with exosomes containing miR-10b significantly suppressed PIK3CA expression and decreased PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activity. Finally, exosomes containing miR-10b reduced fibroblast proliferation but promoted expression of TGF-β and SM α-actin, suggesting that exosomal miR-10b may activate fibroblasts to become CAFs that express myofibroblast markers. These activated fibroblasts were able to promote CRC growth in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: CRC-derived exosomes actively promote disease progression by modulating surrounding stromal cells, which subsequently acquire features of CAFs.

Non-Proximal Renal Tubule-Derived Urinary Exosomal miR-200b as a Biomarker of Renal Fibrosis.	Nephron	2018	BACKGROUND: Renal fibrosis is a common outcome of nearly all kinds of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and eventually progresses to end-stage renal disease. The identification of an optimal biomarker of renal fibrosis to replace the invasive renal biopsy will have important clinical implications. METHODS: We isolated urinary exosomes from 50 participants and examined the exosomal protein content and particle number in 38 CKD patients with different degrees of renal fibrosis and in 12 normal individuals. We examined the levels of exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs), namely, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, miR-429, miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-29c, miR-192, and miR-21, by sorting the exosomes and comparing the levels of proximal tubular, non-proximal tubular, and total exosomal miR-200b. RESULTS: The exosome content was higher in the CKD group, but no differences were evident among the mild, moderate, and severe fibrosis groups. Among the 10 exosomal miRNAs, miR-200b was lower in the CKD group than in the normal group and decreased more significantly with fibrosis progression as well as in IgA nephropathy and diabetic kidney disease. CD13+ CD63+ exosomes constituted 18.6% of all urinary exosomes. Sorting the proximal tubular exosomes with the CD13 protein marker revealed that miR-200b in the CD13+ group was extremely low; however, the result was significantly different in the CD13- group but not in the CD13+ group. The magnitude of the decline was greater in the CD13- groups than in the non-sorted whole groups between the fibrosis and normal patients. CONCLUSIONS: Non-proximal renal tubule-derived urinary exosomal miR-200b is a biomarker of renal fibrosis. Exosomes can be used as a liquid biopsy and may replace the traditional invasive renal biopsy in the diagnosis of renal fibrosis.

Tumor-derived exosomes modulate T cell function through transfer of RNA.	FEBS J	2018	Tumor cells can develop a variety of mechanisms to evade and subvert the immune system for their survival. Bland et al., in this edition of The FEBS Journal, make the novel finding that the tumor line B16F0 can deliver mRNA/miRNA loaded exosomes to cytotoxic T lymphocytes and alter their metabolic function and interferon gamma production.

Mol Cancer Res	2018	A particularly important tumor microenvironment (TME) relationship exists between cancer cells and surrounding stromal cells. Fibroblasts, in response to cancer cells, become activated and exhibit myofibroblastic characteristics that favor invasive growth and metastasis. However, the mechanism by which cancer cells promote activation of healthy fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is still not well understood. Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles that shuttle proteins and nucleic acids between cells to establish intercellular communication. Here, bladder cancer-derived exosomes were investigated to determine their role in the activation of healthy primary vesical fibroblasts. Exosomes released by bladder cancer cells are internalized by fibroblasts and promoted the proliferation and expression of CAF markers. In addition, cancer cell-derived exosomes contain TGFβ and in exosome-induced CAFs SMAD-dependant signaling is activated. Furthermore, TGFβ inhibitors attenuated CAF marker expression in healthy fibroblasts. Therefore, these data demonstrate that bladder cancer cells trigger the differentiation of fibroblasts to CAFs by exosomes-mediated TGFβ transfer and SMAD pathway activation. Finally, exosomal TGFβ localized inside the vesicle and contributes 53.4 to 86.3% of the total TGFβ present in the cancer cell supernatant. This study highlights a new function for bladder cancer exosomes as novel modulators of stromal cell differentiation. IMPLICATIONS: This study identifies exosomal TGFß as new molecular mechanism involved in cancer-associated fibroblast activation.

Murine embryos exposed to human endometrial MSCs-derived extracellular vesicles exhibit higher VEGF/PDGF AA release, increased blastomere count and hatching rates.	PLoS One	2018	Endometrial Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (endMSCs) are multipotent cells with immunomodulatory and pro-regenerative activity which is mainly mediated by a paracrine effect. The exosomes released by MSCs have become a promising therapeutic tool for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. More specifically, extracellular vesicles derived from endMSCs (EV-endMSCs) have demonstrated a cardioprotective effect through the release of anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic factors. Here we hypothesize that EV-endMSCs may be used as a co-adjuvant to improve in vitro fertilization outcomes and embryo quality. Firstly, endMSCs and EV-endMSCs were isolated and phenotypically characterized for in vitro assays. Then, in vitro studies were performed on murine embryos co-cultured with EV-endMSCs at different concentrations. Our results firstly demonstrated a significant increase on the total blastomere count of expanded murine blastocysts. Moreover, EV-endMSCs triggered the release of pro-angiogenic molecules from embryos demonstrating an EV-endMSCs concentration-dependent increase of VEGF and PDGF-AA. The release of VEGF and PDGF-AA by the embryos may indicate that the beneficial effect of EV-endMSCs could be mediating not only an increase in the blastocyst's total cell number, but also may promote endometrial angiogenesis, vascularization, differentiation and tissue remodeling. In summary, these results could be relevant for assisted reproduction being the first report describing the beneficial effect of human EV-endMSCs on embryo development.	PMC5912768

Monocyte-derived extracellular vesicles stimulate cytokine secretion and gene expression of matrix metalloproteinases by mesenchymal stem/stromal cells.	FEBS J	2018	Intercellular communication is essential in bone remodelling to ensure that new bone is formed with only temporary bone loss. Monocytes (MCs) and osteoclasts actively take part in controlling bone remodelling by providing signals that promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have attracted attention as regulators of bone remodelling. EVs facilitate intercellular communication by transferring a complex cargo of biologically active molecules to target cells. In the present study, we evaluated the potency of EVs from MCs and osteoclasts to induce a lineage-specific response in MSCs. We analysed gene expression and protein secretion by both adipose tissue-derived MSCs and bone marrow-derived MSCs after stimulation with EVs from lipopolysaccharide-activated primary human MCs and (mineral-resorbing) osteoclasts. Isolated EVs were enriched in exosomes (EVs of endosomal origin) and were free of cell debris. MC- and osteoclast-derived EVs were taken up by adipose tissue-derived MSCs. EVs from activated MCs promoted the secretion of cytokines by MSCs, which may represent an immunomodulatory mechanism. MC-derived EVs also upregulated the expression of genes encoding for matrix metalloproteinases. Therefore, we hypothesize that MCs facilitate tissue remodelling through EV-mediated signalling. We did not observe a significant effect of osteoclast-derived EVs on gene expression or protein secretion in MSCs. EV-mediated signalling might represent an additional mode of cell-cell signalling during the transition from injury and inflammation to bone regeneration and play an important role in the coupling between bone resorption and bone formation.

Adv Exp Med Biol	2018	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were, due to their immunomodulatory and pro-angiogenic characteristics, extensively explored as new therapeutic agents in cell-based therapy of uveitis, glaucoma, retinal and ocular surface diseases.Since it was recently revealed that exosomes play an important role in biological functions of MSCs, herewith we summarized current knowledge about the morphology, structure, phenotype and functional characteristics of MSC-derived exosomes emphasizing their therapeutic potential in the treatment of eye diseases.MSC-derived exosomes were as efficient as transplanted MSCs in limiting the extent of eye injury and inflammation. Immediately after intravitreal injection, MSC-derived exosomes, due to nano-dimension, diffused rapidly throughout the retina and significantly attenuated retinal damage and inflammation. MSC-derived exosomes successfully delivered trophic and immunomodulatory factors to the inner retina and efficiently promoted survival and neuritogenesis of injured retinal ganglion cells. MSC-derived exosomes efficiently suppressed migration of inflammatory cells, attenuated detrimental Th1 and Th17 cell-driven immune response and ameliorated experimental autoimmune uveitis. MSC-derived exosomes were able to fuse with the lysosomes within corneal cells, enabling delivering of MSC-derived active β-glucuronidase and consequent catabolism of accumulated glycosaminoglycans, indicating their therapeutic potential in the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (Sly Syndrome). Importantly, beneficent effects were noticed only in animals that received MSC-derived exosomes and were not seen after therapy with fibroblasts-derived exosomes confirming specific therapeutic potential of MSCs and their products in the treatment of eye diseases.In conclusion, MSC-derived exosomes represent potentially new therapeutic agents in the therapy of degenerative and inflammatory ocular diseases.

Facilitation of mRNA deadenylation and decay by the exosome-bound, DExH protein RHAU.	Mol Cell	2004	The AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3' untranslated region of unstable mRNAs mediate their rapid degradation. ARE binding proteins (AUBPs) have been described that either stabilize or otherwise degrade ARE-mRNAs by recruiting the exosome, a complex of 3'-to-5' exoribonucleases. We have identified RHAU, a putative DExH RNA helicase that was isolated in association with the ARE of urokinase plasminogen activator mRNA (ARE(uPA)). RHAU physically interacts with the deadenylase PARN and the human exosome and enhances the deadenylation and decay of ARE(uPA)-mRNAs. An alternatively spliced isoform of RHAU that localized to the cytoplasm had a more pronounced effect on ARE(uPA)-mRNA destabilization than full-length RHAU. Furthermore, the ATPase activity of RHAU is essential for its mRNA-destabilizing function. ARE(uPA)-mRNA recognition by RHAU may be mediated through its RNA-dependent interaction with the AUBPs HuR and NFAR1. A model is presented to describe the action of RHAU in ARE(uPA)-directed mRNA turnover.

Mature dendritic cells secrete exosomes with strong ability to induce antigen-specific effector immune responses.	Blood Cells Mol Dis	2005 Sep-Oct	Exosomes are secreted vesicles formed in late endocytic compartments. Immature dendritic cells (DCs) secrete exosomes which transfer functional MHC-peptide complexes to other DCs. Since immature and mature DCs induce different functional T cell responses (i.e., tolerance versus priming), we asked whether DC maturation also influenced the priming abilities of their exosomes. We show that immature and mature murine DCs secrete morphologically similar exosomes. Extensive proteomic analysis of the two exosome populations showed identical overall protein composition, and provided an exhaustive image of the protein composition of DC-derived exosomes. By quantitative analysis, however, exosomes from mature DCs proved enriched in MHC class II, B7.2, ICAM-1, and depleted in MFG-E8, as compared to immature exosomes. In functional T cell stimulation assays, exosomes secreted by mature DCs were 50- to 100-fold more potent than exosomes from immature DCs, both in vitro and in vivo. MHC class II and ICAM-1 were necessary for the increased immune activity of exosomes secreted by mature DCs. Therefore, changes in protein composition and priming abilities of exosomes reflect the maturation signals received by DCs.

Dendritic cell-derived exosomes express a Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide type 14 cross-reactive antigen that induces protective immunoglobulin responses against pneumococcal infection in mice.	Infect Immun	2007	Exosomes activate T cells in vivo, but whether exosomes are able to induce humoral immune responses is still unknown. We found that dendritic cells, but not other immune cells, constitutively release an exosome-associated glycoconjugate that is cross-reactive with the capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 14 (Cps14-CRA). Cps14-CRA was localized to the cholesterol-enriched microdomains or rafts of the exosomes and was mapped to the beta1-->6 branched N-acetyl-lactosamine derivatives of the Cps14-CRA. Injection of CFA-primed naive mice with purified dendritic cell exosomes induced immunoglobulin (Ig) anti-Cps14 responses composed predominantly of IgM, IgG3, and IgG1. These responses were associated with protection against a lethal challenge with live S. pneumoniae type 14, but not with type 3 bacteria, and was correlated with the titer of elicited IgM and IgG3 anti-Cps14. These data show, for the first time, that exosomes can induce a humoral immune response to an associated unprocessed, autologous antigen. Although anti-Cps14 Ig responses are specifically demonstrated, these could reflect a broader mechanism that modulates both natural immunity and autoimmunity to other glycotopes.	PMC1828418

Effective treatment of inflammatory disease models with exosomes derived from dendritic cells genetically modified to express IL-4.	J Immunol	2007	In this study, we demonstrate that genetically modified bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) and exosomes derived from the DC, expressing either secreted IL-4 or membrane-bound IL-4, can reduce the severity and the incidence of established collagen-induced arthritis and inhibit inflammation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) in mice. The ability of the DC and DC-derived exosomes to suppress the DTH response was MHC class II and, in part, Fas ligand/Fas dependent. The DC-derived exosomes were internalized by CD11c(+) DC in the dermis at the site of injection and in the draining lymph node as well as by CD11c(+) DC and F4/80(+) macrophages in the spleen. Moreover, adoptive transfer of CD11c(+) or CD3(+) splenic cells from mice treated with exosomes showed significant reduction of footpad swelling in the DTH model. These results demonstrate that administration of DC/IL-4 or exosomes derived from DC/IL-4 are able to modulate the activity of APC and T cells in vivo through a MHC class II and partly Fas ligand/Fas-dependent mechanism, resulting in effective treatment of established collagen-induced arthritis and suppression of the DTH inflammatory response. Thus, APC-derived exosomes could be used therapeutically for the treatment of autoimmune disease and inflammatory disorders.

Exosomes derived from M. Bovis BCG infected macrophages activate antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo.	PLoS One	2008	Activation of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells is required for an effective immune response to an M. tuberculosis infection. However, infected macrophages are poor antigen presenting cells and may be spatially separated from recruited T cells, thus limiting antigen presentation within a granuloma. Our previous studies showed that infected macrophages release from cells small membrane-bound vesicles called exosomes which contain mycobacterial lipid components and showed that these exosomes could stimulate a pro-inflammatory response in naïve macrophages. In the present study we demonstrate that exosomes stimulate both CD4(+) and CD8(+) splenic T cells isolated from mycobacteria-sensitized mice. Although the exosomes contain MHC I and II as well as costimulatory molecules, maximum stimulation of T cells required prior incubation of exosomes with antigen presenting cells. Exosomes isolated from M. bovis and M. tuberculosis infected macrophages also stimulated activation and maturation of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Interestingly, intranasal administration of mice with exosomes isolated from M. bovis BCG infected macrophages induce the generation of memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. The isolated T cells also produced IFN-gamma upon restimulation with BCG antigens. The release of exosomes from infected macrophages may overcome some of the defects in antigen presentation associated with mycobacterial infections and we suggest that exosomes may be a promising M. tuberculosis vaccine candidate.

Therapeutic effect of exosomes from indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-positive dendritic cells in collagen-induced arthritis and delayed-type hypersensitivity disease models.	Arthritis Rheum	2009	OBJECTIVE: We have demonstrated previously that dendritic cells (DCs) modified with immunosuppressive cytokines, and exosomes derived from DCs can suppress the onset of murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and reduce the severity of established arthritis. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a tryptophan-degrading enzyme that is important for immune regulation and tolerance maintenance. DCs expressing functional IDO can inhibit T cells by depleting them of essential tryptophan and/or by producing toxic metabolites, as well as by generating Treg cells. This study was undertaken to examine the immunosuppressive effects of bone marrow (BM)-derived DCs genetically modified to express IDO, and of exosomes derived from IDO-positive DCs. METHODS: BM-derived DCs were adenovirally transduced with IDO or CTLA-4Ig (an inducer of IDO), and the resulting DCs and exosomes were tested for their immunosuppressive ability in the CIA and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) murine models. RESULTS: Both DCs and exosomes derived from DCs overexpressing IDO had an antiinflammatory effect in CIA and DTH murine models. The suppressive effects were partially dependent on B7 costimulatory molecules. In addition, gene transfer of CTLA-4Ig to DCs resulted in induction of IDO in the DCs and in exosomes able to reduce inflammation in an IDO-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that both IDO-expressing DCs and DC-derived exosomes are immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory, and are able to reverse established arthritis. Therefore, exosomes from IDO-positive DCs may represent a novel therapy for rheumatoid arthritis.	PMC3491653

MHC II in dendritic cells is targeted to lysosomes or T cell-induced exosomes via distinct multivesicular body pathways.	Traffic	2009	Dendritic cells (DCs) express major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) to present peptide antigens to T cells. In immature DCs, which bear low cell surface levels of MHC II, peptide-loaded MHC II is ubiquitinated. Ubiquitination drives the endocytosis and sorting of MHC II to the luminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for lysosomal degradation. Ubiquitination of MHC II is abrogated in activated DCs, resulting in an increased cell surface expression. We here provide evidence for an alternative MVB sorting mechanism for MHC II in antigen-loaded DCs, which is triggered by cognately interacting antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. At these conditions, DCs generate MVBs with MHC II and CD9 carrying luminal vesicles that are secreted as exosomes and transferred to the interacting T cells. Sorting of MHC II into exosomes was, in contrast to lysosomal targeting, independent of MHC II ubiquitination but rather correlated with its incorporation into CD9 containing detergent-resistant membranes. Together, these data indicate two distinct MVB pathways: one for lysosomal targeting and the other for exosome secretion.

Nucleic acids within urinary exosomes/microvesicles are potential biomarkers for renal disease.	Kidney Int	2010	Urinary exosomes or microvesicles are being studied intensively to identify potential new biomarkers for renal disease. We sought to identify whether these microvesicles contain nucleic acids. We isolated microvesicles from human urine in the same density range as that previously described for urinary exosomes and found them to have an RNA integrity profile similar to that of kidney tissue, including 18S and 28S rRNA. This profile was better preserved in urinary microvesicles compared with whole cells isolated from urine, suggesting that microvesicles may protect RNA during urine passage. We were able to detect mRNA in the human urinary microvesicles encoding proteins from all regions of the nephron and the collecting duct. Further, to provide a proof of principle, we found that microvesicles isolated from the urine of the V-ATPase B1 subunit knockout mice lacked mRNA of this subunit while containing a normal amount of the B2 subunit and aquaporin 2. The microvesicles were found to be contaminated with extraneous DNA potentially on their surface; therefore, we developed a rapid and reliable means to isolate nucleic acids from within urine microvesicles devoid of this extraneous contamination. Our study provides an experimental strategy for the routine isolation and use of urinary microvesicles as a novel and non-invasive source of nucleic acids to further renal disease biomarker discovery.

Leishmania exosomes modulate innate and adaptive immune responses through effects on monocytes and dendritic cells.	J Immunol	2010	We investigated the properties of leishmania exosomes with respect to influencing innate and adaptive immune responses. Exosomes from Leishmania donovani modulated human monocyte cytokine responses to IFN-γ in a bimodal fashion by promoting IL-10 production and inhibiting that of TNF-α. Moreover, these vesicles were inhibitory with respect to cytokine responses (IL-12p70, TNF-α, and IL-10) by human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Exosomes from wild-type (WT) L. donovani failed to prime monocyte-derived dendritic cells to drive the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells. In contrast, vesicles from heat shock protein (HSP)100(-/-) L. donovani showed a gain-of-function and proinflammatory phenotype and promoted the differentiation of naive CD4 lymphocytes into Th1 cells. Proteomic analysis showed that exosomes from WT and HSP100(-/-) leishmania had distinct protein cargo, suggesting that packaging of proteins into exosomes is dependent in part on HSP100. Treatment of C57BL/6 mice with WT L. donovani exosomes prior to challenge with WT organisms exacerbated infection and promoted IL-10 production in the spleen. In contrast, HSP100(-/-) exosomes promoted spleen cell production of IFN-γ and did not adversely affect hepatic parasite burdens. Furthermore, the proparasitic properties of WT exosomes were not species specific because BALB/c mice exposed to Leishmania major exosomes showed increased Th2 polarization and exacerbation of disease in response to infection with L. major. These findings demonstrate that leishmania exosomes are predominantly immunosuppressive. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first evidence to suggest that changes in the protein cargo of exosomes may influence the impact of these vesicles on myeloid cell function.

Chemokine-containing exosomes are released from heat-stressed tumor cells via lipid raft-dependent pathway and act as efficient tumor vaccine.	J Immunol	2011	Exosomes derived from dendritic cells or tumor cells are a population of nanometer-sized membrane vesicles that can induce specific antitumor immunity. During investigation of the effects of hyperthermia on antitumor immune response, we found that exosomes derived from heat-stressed tumor cells (HS-TEX) could chemoattract and activate dendritic cells (DC) and T cells more potently than that by conventional tumor-derived exosomes. We show that HS-TEX contain chemokines, such as CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and CCL20, and the chemokine-containing HS-TEX are functionally competent in chemoattracting CD11c(+) DC and CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the production of chemokine-containing HS-TEX could be inhibited by ATP inhibitor, calcium chelator, and cholesterol scavenger, indicating that the mobilization of chemokines into exosomes was ATP- and calcium-dependent and via a lipid raft-dependent pathway. We consistently found that the intracellular chemokines could be enriched in lipid rafts after heat stress. Accordingly, intratumoral injection of HS-TEX could induce specific antitumor immune response more efficiently than that by tumor-derived exosomes, thus inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging survival of tumor-bearing mice more significantly. Therefore, our results demonstrate that exosomes derived from HS-TEX represent a kind of efficient tumor vaccine and can chemoattract and activate DC and T cells, inducing more potent antitumor immune response. Release of chemokines through exosomes via lipid raft-dependent pathway may be a new method of chemokine exocytosis.

Mol Reprod Dev	2011	Human prostasomes, exosome-like microvesicles secreted by acinar cells of the prostate gland, contain chromosomal DNA. Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA from seminal prostasomes displayed fragments of over 12 kb and smaller, with a distinct band around 1 kb that was excised, cloned, and sequenced. The sequences showed 8 out of 25 clones (32%) originating from genes. We elaborated the concept further by carrying out a genome-wide DNA copy number analysis of prostasomal DNA, hypothesizing that human prostasomes contain fragments of DNA randomly selected from the entire genome. Acridine orange-stained prostasomes were incubated with freshly prepared sperm for different times, and a transfer of acridine orange-stained prostasomal DNA to sperm (preferentially the head region) was observed. Fluorescence microscopy of slices in the center of 14 optical slides of the sperm head displayed an even fluorescence rather than a halo-like one, indicating DNA-uptake rather than just binding along the sperm head membrane.

Immunology	2012	Many MHC class I molecules contain unpaired cysteine residues in their cytoplasmic tail domains, the function of which remains relatively uncharacterized. Recently, it has been shown that in the small secretory vesicles known as exosomes, fully folded MHC class I dimers can form through a disulphide bond between the cytoplasmic tail domain cysteines, induced by the low levels of glutathione in these extracellular vesicles. Here we address whether similar MHC class I dimers form in whole cells by alteration of the redox environment. Treatment of the HLA-B27-expressing Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line Jesthom, and the leukaemic T-cell line CEM transfected with HLA-B27 with the strong oxidant diamide, and the apoptosis-inducing and glutathione-depleting agents hydrogen peroxide and thimerosal, induced MHC class I dimers. Furthermore, induction of apoptosis by cross-linking FasR/CD95 on CEM cells with monoclonal antibody CH-11 also induced MHC class I dimers. As with exosomal MHC class I dimers, the formation of these structures on cells is controlled by the cysteine at position 325 in the cytoplasmic tail domain of HLA-B27. Therefore, the redox environment of cells intimately controls induction of MHC class I dimers, the formation of which may provide novel structures for recognition by the immune system.	PMC3277715

The majority of microRNAs detectable in serum and saliva is concentrated in exosomes.	PLoS One	2012	There is an increasing interest in using microRNAs (miRNA) as biomarkers in autoimmune diseases. They are easily accessible in many body fluids but it is controversial if they are circulating freely or are encapsulated in microvesicles, particularly exosomes. We investigated if the majority of miRNas in serum and saliva are free-circulating or concentrated in exosomes. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation from fresh and frozen human serum and saliva. The amount of selected miRNAs extracted from the exosomal pellet and the exosome-depleted serum and saliva was compared by quantitative RT-PCR. Some miRNAs tested are ubiquitously expressed, others were previously reported as biomarkers. We included miRNAs previously reported to be free circulating and some thought to be exosome specific. The purity of exosome fraction was confirmed by electronmicroscopy and western blot. The concentration of miRNAs was consistently higher in the exosome pellet compared to the exosome-depleted supernatant. We obtained the same results using an equal volume or equal amount of total RNA as input of the RT-qPCR. The concentration of miRNA in whole, unfractionated serum, was between the exosomal pellet and the exosome-depleted supernatant. Selected miRNAs, which were detectable in exosomes, were undetectable in whole serum and the exosome-depleted supernantant. Exosome isolation improves the sensitivity of miRNA amplification from human biologic fluids. Exosomal miRNA should be the starting point for early biomarker studies to reduce the probability of false negative results involving low abundance miRNAs that may be missed by using unfractionated serum or saliva.

Nanoparticle analysis of circulating cell-derived vesicles in ovarian cancer patients.	Anal Biochem	2012	Cell-derived vesicles are recognized as essential components of intercellular communication, and many disease processes are associated with their aberrant composition and release. Circulating tumor-derived vesicles have major potential as biomarkers; however, the diagnostic use of exosomes is limited by the technology available for their objective characterization and measurement. In this study, we compare nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) with submicron particle analysis (SPA), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and electron microscopy (EM) to objectively define size distribution, number, and phenotype of circulating cell-derived vesicles from ovarian cancer patients. Using the NanoSight LM10 instrument, cell-derived vesicles were visualized by laser light scattering and analyzing Brownian motion of these vesicles captured by video. The NTA software calculates the size and total concentration of the vesicles in solution. Using vesicles isolated from ovarian cancer patients, we demonstrate that NTA can measure the size distributions of cell-derived vesicles comparable to other analysis instrumentation. Size determinations by NTA, SPA, and DLS were more objective and complete than that obtained with the commonly used EM approach. NTA can also define the total vesicle concentration. Furthermore, the use of fluorescent-labeled antibodies against specific markers with NTA allows the determination of the "phenotype" of the cell-derived vesicles.

Alternative methods for characterization of extracellular vesicles.	Front Physiol	2012	Extracellular vesicles (ECVs) are nano-sized vesicles released by all cells in vitro as well as in vivo. Their role has been implicated mainly in cell-cell communication, but also in disease biomarkers and more recently in gene delivery. They represent a snapshot of the cell status at the moment of release and carry bioreactive macromolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. A major limitation in this emerging new field is the availability/awareness of techniques to isolate and properly characterize ECVs. The lack of gold standards makes comparing different studies very difficult and may potentially hinder some ECVs-specific evidence. Characterization of ECVs has also recently seen many advances with the use of Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, flow cytometry, cryo-electron microscopy instruments, and proteomic technologies. In this review, we discuss the latest developments in translational technologies involving characterization methods including the facts in their support and the challenges they face.	PMC3435888

Docetaxel-resistance in prostate cancer: evaluating associated phenotypic changes and potential for resistance transfer via exosomes.	PLoS One	2012	BACKGROUND: Hormone-refractory prostate cancer remains hindered by inevitable progression of resistance to first-line treatment with docetaxel. Recent studies suggest that phenotypic changes associated with cancer may be transferred from cell-to-cell via microvesicles/exosomes. Here we aimed to investigate phenotypic changes associated with docetaxel-resistance in order to help determine the complexity of this problem and to assess the relevance of secreted exosomes in prostate cancer. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Docetaxel-resistant variants of DU145 and 22Rv1 were established and characterised in terms of cross-resistance, morphology, proliferation, motility, invasion, anoikis, colony formation, exosomes secretion their and functional relevance. Preliminary analysis of exosomes from relevant serum specimens was also performed. Acquired docetaxel-resistance conferred cross-resistance to doxorubicin and induced alterations in motility, invasion, proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Exosomes expelled from DU145 and 22Rv1 docetaxel-resistant variants (DU145RD and 22Rv1RD) conferred docetaxel-resistance to DU145, 22Rv1 and LNCap cells, which may be partly due to exosomal MDR-1/P-gp transfer. Exosomes from prostate cancer patients' sera induced increased cell proliferation and invasion, compared to exosomes from age-matched controls. Furthermore, exosomes from sera of patients undergoing a course of docetaxel treatment compared to matched exosomes from the same patients prior to commencing docetaxel treatment, when applied to both DU145 and 22Rv1 cells, showed a correlation between cellular response to docetaxel and patients' response to treatment with docetaxel. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our studies indicate the complex and multifaceted nature of docetaxel-resistance in prostate cancer. Furthermore, our in vitro observations and preliminary clinical studies indicate that exosomes may play an important role in prostate cancer, in cell-cell communication, and thus may offer potential as vehicles containing predictive biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.

Theriogenology	2013	Mammalian seminal plasma contains membranous vesicles (exosomes), with a high content of cholesterol and sphingomyelin and a complex protein composition. Their physiological role is uncertain because sperm stabilization and activation effects have been reported. To analyze a putative modulatory role for semen exosomes on sperm activity in the boar, the effects of these vesicles on several sperm functional parameters were examined. Additionally, boar exosome proteins were sequenced and their incorporation into sperm was explored. Boar sperm were incubated under conditions that induce capacitation, manifested as increased tyrosine phosphorylation, cholesterol loss and greater fluidity in apical membranes, and the ability to undergo the lysophosphatidylcholine-induced acrosome reaction. After establishing this cluster of capacitation-dependent functional parameters, the effect produced by exosomes when present during or after sperm capacitation was analyzed. Exosomes inhibited the capacitation-dependent cholesterol efflux and fluidity increase in apical membranes, and the disappearance of a 14-kD phosphorylated polypeptide. In contrast, the acrosome reaction (spontaneous and lysophosphatidylcholine-induced) was not affected, and sperm binding to the oocyte zona pellucida was reduced only when vesicles were present during gamete coincubation. Liposomes with a lipid composition similar to that present in exosomes mimicked these effects, except the one on zona pellucida binding. Interaction between exosomes and sperm was confirmed by transfer of aminopeptidase activity. In addition, the major exosome protein, identified as actin, appeared to associate with sperm after coincubation. Exosome composition had a predominance for structural proteins (actin, plastin, ezrin, and condensin), enzymes, and several porcine seminal plasma-specific polypeptides (e.g., spermadhesins). Transfer of proteins from exosome to sperm and their ability to block cholesterol efflux supports a direct interaction between these vesicles and sperm, whereas inhibition of some capacitation-dependent features suggests a stabilizing function for exosomes in boar semen.

Ultrastructural analysis of hepatitis C virus particles.	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2013	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease, with an estimated 170 million people infected worldwide. Low yields, poor stability, and inefficient binding to conventional EM grids have posed significant challenges to the purification and structural analysis of HCV. In this report, we generated an infectious HCV genome with an affinity tag fused to the E2 envelope glycoprotein. Using affinity grids, previously described to isolate proteins and macromolecular complexes for single-particle EM, we were able to purify enveloped particles directly from cell culture media. This approach allowed for rapid in situ purification of virions and increased particle density that were instrumental for cryo-EM and cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET). Moreover, it enabled ultrastructural analysis of virions produced by primary human hepatocytes. HCV appears to be the most structurally irregular member of the Flaviviridae family. Particles are spherical, with spike-like projections, and heterogeneous in size ranging from 40 to 100 nm in diameter. Exosomes, although isolated from unfractionated culture media, were absent in highly infectious, purified virus preparations. Cryo-ET studies provided low-resolution 3D structural information of highly infectious virions. In addition to apolipoprotein (apo)E, HCV particles also incorporate apoB and apoA-I. In general, host apolipoproteins were more readily accessible to antibody labeling than HCV glycoproteins, suggesting either lower abundance or masking by host proteins.	PMC3677472

Neurotransmitter-triggered transfer of exosomes mediates oligodendrocyte-neuron communication.	PLoS Biol	2013	Reciprocal interactions between neurons and oligodendrocytes are not only crucial for myelination, but also for long-term survival of axons. Degeneration of axons occurs in several human myelin diseases, however the molecular mechanisms of axon-glia communication maintaining axon integrity are poorly understood. Here, we describe the signal-mediated transfer of exosomes from oligodendrocytes to neurons. These endosome-derived vesicles are secreted by oligodendrocytes and carry specific protein and RNA cargo. We show that activity-dependent release of the neurotransmitter glutamate triggers oligodendroglial exosome secretion mediated by Ca²⁺ entry through oligodendroglial NMDA and AMPA receptors. In turn, neurons internalize the released exosomes by endocytosis. Injection of oligodendroglia-derived exosomes into the mouse brain results in functional retrieval of exosome cargo in neurons. Supply of cultured neurons with oligodendroglial exosomes improves neuronal viability under conditions of cell stress. These findings indicate that oligodendroglial exosomes participate in a novel mode of bidirectional neuron-glia communication contributing to neuronal integrity.	PMC3706306

BMC Cancer	2013	BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play an important role in tumor microenvironment. Particularly, M2 macrophages contribute to tumor progression, depending on the expression of NF-κB. Tumor-derived exosomes can modulate tumor microenvironment by transferring miRNAs to immune cells. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has well known anti-tumor effects; however, no data are available on the influence of EGCG on communication with cancer cells and TAM. METHODS: Murine breast cancer cell lines, 4T1, was used for in vivo and ex vivo studies. Exosome was extracted from EGCG-treated 4T1 cells, and the change of miRNAs was screened using microarray. Tumor cells or TAM isolated from murine tumor graft were incubated with exosomes derived from EGCG-treated and/or miR-16 inhibitor-transfected 4T1 cells. Chemokines for monocytes (CSF-1 and CCL-2), cytokines both with high (IL-6 and TGF-β) and low (TNF-α) expression in M2 macrophages, and molecules in NF-κB pathway (IKKα and Iκ-B) were evaluated by RT-qPCR or western blot. RESULTS: EGCG suppressed tumor growth in murine breast cancer model, which was associated with decreased TAM and M2 macrophage infiltration. Expression of chemokine for monocytes (CSF-1 and CCL-2) were low in tumor cells from EGCG-treated mice, and cytokines of TAM was skewed from M2- into M1-like phenotype by EGCG as evidenced by decreased IL-6 and TGF-β and increased TNF-α. Ex vivo incubation of isolated tumor cells with EGCG inhibited the CSF-1 and CCL-2 expression. Ex vivo incubation of TAM with exosomes from EGCG-treated 4T1 cells led to IKKα suppression and concomitant I-κB accumulation; increase of IL-6 and TGF-β; and, decrease of TNF-α. EGCG up-regulated miR-16 in 4T1 cells and in the exosomes. Treatment of tumor cells or TAM with exosomes derived from EGCG-treated and miR-16-knock-downed 4T1 cells restored the above effects on chemokines, cytokines, and NF-κB pathway elicited by EGCG-treated exosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that EGCG up-regulates miR-16 in tumor cells, which can be transferred to TAM via exosomes and inhibits TAM infiltration and M2 polarization. We suggest a novel mechanism by which EGCG exerts anti-tumor activity via regulation of TAM in tumor microenvironment.	PMC3848851

Induction and transport of Wnt 5a during macrophage-induced malignant invasion is mediated by two types of extracellular vesicles.	Oncotarget	2013	Recently, we have shown that macrophage (MΦ)-induced invasion of breast cancer cells requires upregulation of Wnt 5a in MΦ leading to activation of β-Catenin-independent Wnt signaling in the tumor cells. However, it remained unclear, how malignant cells induce Wnt 5a in MΦ and how it is transferred back to the cancer cells. Here we identify two types of extracellular particles as essential for this intercellular interaction in both directions. Plasma membrane-derived microvesicles (MV) as well as exosomes from breast cancer cells, although biologically distinct populations, both induce Wnt 5a in MΦ. In contrast, the particle-free supernatant and vesicles from benign cells, such as platelets, have no such effect. Induction is antagonized by the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1. Subsequently, Wnt 5a is shuttled via responding MΦ-MV and exosomes to the tumor cells enhancing their invasion. Wnt 5a export on both vesicle fractions depends at least partially on the cargo protein Evenness interrupted (Evi). Its knockdown leads to Wnt 5a depletion of both particle populations and reduced vesicle-mediated invasion. In conclusion, MV and exosomes are critical for MΦ-induced invasion of cancer cells since they are responsible for upregulation of MΦ-Wnt 5a as well as for its delivery to the recipient cells via a reciprocal loop. Although of different biogenesis, both populations share common features regarding function and Evi-dependent secretion of non-canonical Wnts.	PMC3875769

DSPP contains an IRES element responsible for the translation of dentin phosphophoryn.	J Dent Res	2014	The major phosphoprotein in dentin is the aspartic acid and serine-rich protein called dentin phosphophoryn (DPP). DPP appears to be synthesized as a part of a larger compound protein, dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP). DSPP has never been isolated or detected in dentin extracts. It is now evident that DSPP is a chimeric protein composed of 3 parts: dentin sialoprotein (DSP), DPP, and dentin glycoprotein (DGP). Previous reports have suggested that the BMP1 protease is responsible for processing DSPP. However, unequal amounts of these products are present in the dentin matrix. Here, we provide evidence for an internal ribosome entry site in the DSPP gene that directs the synthesis of DPP. This mechanism would account for unequal amounts of intracellular DSP and DPP. The internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) activity varied in different cell types, suggesting the presence of additional regulatory elements during the translational regulation of DPP. Further, we provide evidence that DPP is transported to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through exosomes. Using tissue recombination and lentivirus-mediated gain-of-function approaches, we also demonstrate that DPP is essential for the formation of well-defined tooth structures with mineralized dentin matrix.

J Cell Sci	2014	Resistance to adverse environmental conditions, such as hypoxia, contributes to the reduced efficacy of anticancer therapies and tumor progression. Although deregulated expression of many long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) occurs in human cancers, the contribution of such RNA to tumor responses to hypoxia are unknown. RNA expression profiling identified several hypoxia-responsive lncRNAs, including the long intergenic noncoding RNA, regulator of reprogramming (linc-RoR), which is also increased in expression in malignant liver cancer cells. Linc-RoR expression was increased in hypoxic regions within tumor cell xenografts in vivo. Tumor cell viability during hypoxia was reduced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) to linc-RoR. Compared with controls, siRNA to linc-RoR decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K1 (RPS6KB1), PDK1 and HIF-1α protein expression and increased expression of the linc-RoR target microRNA-145 (miR-145). Linc-RoR was highly expressed in extracellular RNA released by hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cells during hypoxia. Incubation with extracellular vesicle preparations containing extracellular RNA increased linc-RoR, HIF-1α expression and cell survival in recipient cells. These studies show that linc-RoR is a hypoxia-responsive lncRNA that is functionally linked to hypoxia signaling in HCC through a miR-145-HIF-1α signaling module. Furthermore, this work identifies a mechanistic role for the extracellular transfer of linc-RoR in intercellular signaling to promote cell survival during hypoxic stress.	PMC3970562
24645843	X H Wu				Renal tumor-derived exosomes inhibit hepaCAM expression of renal carcinoma cells in a p-AKT-dependent manner.	Neoplasma	2014	HepaCAM mediates cancer cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. Our previous studies showed the effects of hepaCAM on the inhibition of renal carcinoma cell proliferation. To further investigate the reason for the low expression of hepaCAM in renal carcinoma and the corresponding molecular mechanisms, we detected renal carcinoma OS-RC-2 cell lines containing high expression of hepaCAM; and hepaCAM and p-AKT were also detected in these cells. Exosomes were isolated and purified from the supernatant liquid of OS-RC-2 cells. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and flow cytometry analysis were conducted to determine the effect of exosomes on the proliferation and cycle distribution of OS-RC-2 cells. OS-RC-2 cells (high expression of hepaCAM) were treated with exosomes or plus MK-2206 (AKT inhibitor); and hepaCAM, AKT and p-AKT were detected in these cells by western blot analysis. The correlation between hepaCAM and p-AKT was analysed by immunohistochemical method. Results showed that hepaCAM re-expression in OS-RC-2 cell lines resulted in significant weakening of proliferation ability and more prominent G0/G1 population as well as reduction of p-AKT protein. The increase in proliferation caused by exosomes was followed by hepaCAM downregulation and p-AKT upregulation in OS-RC-2 cells (high expression of hepaCAM). By comparison, the promotion of proliferation caused by exosomes was weakened and hepaCAM expression changed after MK-2206 treatment; however, this change was not significant. HepaCAM was negatively correlated with p-AKT protein in renal cell carcinoma tissues. Therefore, renal tumor-derived exosomes may be an important factor resulting in the low expression of hepaCAM by upregulating p-AKT in renal carcinoma.

Electronic address: .	ksnym@chem.agr.hokudai.ac.jp		Adiponectin is partially associated with exosomes in mouse serum.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2014	Exosomes are membrane vesicles 30-120 nm in diameter that are released by many cell types and carry a cargo of proteins, lipids, mRNA, and microRNA. Cultured adipocytes reportedly release exosomes that may play a role in cell-to-cell communication during the development of metabolic diseases. However, the characteristics and function of exosomes released from adipocytes in vivo remain to be elucidated. Clearly, adipocyte-derived exosomes could exist in the circulation and may be associated with adipocyte-specific proteins such as adipocytokines. We isolated exosomes from serum of mice by differential centrifugation and analyzed adiponectin, leptin, and resistin in the exosome fraction. Western blotting detected adiponectin but no leptin and only trace amounts of resistin in the exosome fraction. The adiponectin signal in the exosome fraction was decreased by proteinase K treatment and completely quenched by a combination of proteinase K and Triton X-100. Quantitative ELISA showed that the exosome fraction contains considerable amounts of adiponectin, but not leptin or resistin. The concentration of adiponectin in the serum and the ratio of adiponectin to total protein in the exosome fraction were lower in obese mice than in lean mice. These results suggest that a portion of adiponectin exists as a transmembrane protein in the exosomes in mouse serum. We propose adiponectin as a marker of exosomes released from adipocytes in vivo.

Exosomal miR-21 derived from arsenite-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells promotes cell proliferation associated with arsenite carcinogenesis.	Arch Toxicol	2015	Intercellular communications within the cancer microenvironment coordinate the assembly of various cell types. Exosomes are mediators of intercellular communication in immune signaling, tumor promotion, stress responses, and angiogenesis. The present research aimed to determine whether miRNAs secreted from human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells transformed by 1.0 μM arsenite are transferred into normal HBE cells and are functionally active in the recipient cells. The results show that miR-21 is involved in exosome-mediated intercellular communication between neoplastic and normal HBE cells. Exosomes derived from transformed HBE cells stimulated proliferation of normal HBE cells, whereas exosomes from miR-21 depleted cells failed to stimulate proliferation. In normal HBE cells, the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog, a target gene for miR-21, was increased by exosomal miR-21, indicating that exogenous miRNAs, via exosomal transport, function-like endogenous miRNAs. Concordantly, specific reduction of miR-21 content in exosome-producing transformed cells abolished the stimulation of proliferation by exosomes. Collectively, the data indicate that transformed HBE cells release exosomes containing miR-21, stimulating proliferation in neighboring normal HBE cells and supporting the concept that exosomal miRNAs are involved in cell-cell communication during carcinogenesis induced by environmental chemicals.

Mol Cancer	2014	BACKGROUND: Recent findings indicate that exosomes released from cancer cells contain microRNAs (miRNAs) that may be delivered to cells of tumor microenvironment. RESULTS: To elucidate whether miRNAs secreted from chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (CML) are shuttled into endothelial cells thus affecting their phenotype, we first analysed miRNAs content in LAMA84 exosomes. Among the 124 miRNAs identified in LAMA84 exosomes, we focused our attention on miR-126 which was found to be over-overexpressed in exosomes compared with producing parental cells. Transfection of LAMA84 with Cy3-labelled miR-126 and co-culture of leukemia cells with endothelial cells (EC) confirmed that miR-126 is shuttled into HUVECs. The treatment of HUVECs with LAMA84 exosomes for 24 hours reduced CXCL12 and VCAM1 expression, both at the mRNA and protein level, and negatively modulated LAMA84 motility and cells adhesion. Transfection in HUVECs of miR-126 inhibitor reversed the decrease of CXCL12 and restored the motility and adhesion of LAMA84 cells while the over-expression of miR-126, showed opposite effects. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the miR-126 shuttled by exosomes is biologically active in the target cells, and support the hypothesis that exosomal miRNAs have an important role in tumor-endothelial crosstalk occurring in the bone marrow microenvironment, potentially affecting disease progression.

Different gDNA content in the subpopulations of prostate cancer extracellular vesicles: apoptotic bodies, microvesicles, and exosomes.	Prostate	2014	BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived membrane vesicles. EVs contain several RNAs such as mRNA, microRNAs, and ncRNAs, but less is known of their genomic DNA (gDNA) content. It is also unknown whether the DNA cargo is randomly sorted or if it is systematically packed into specific EV subpopulations. The aim of this study was to analyze whether different prostate cancer (PCa) cell-derived EV subpopulations (apoptotic bodies, microvesicles, and exosomes) carry different gDNA fragments. METHODS: EV subpopulations were isolated from three PCa cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, and RC92a/hTERT) and the plasma of PCa patients and healthy donors, and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and total protein content. gDNA fragments of different genes were detected by real time quantitative PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: We report that the concentration of EVs was higher in the cancer patients than in the healthy controls. EV subpopulations differed from each other in terms of total protein and DNA content. Analysis of gDNA fragments of MLH1, PTEN, and TP53 genes from the PCa cell-derived EV subpopulations showed that different EVs carried different gDNA content, which could even harbor specific mutations. Altogether, these results suggest that both nucleic acids and proteins are selectively and cell-dependently packed into the EV subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: EVs derived from PCa cell lines and human plasma samples contain double-stranded gDNA fragments which could be used to detect specific mutations, making EVs potential biomarkers for cancer diagnostics and prognostics.

Cancer Res	2014	Exosomes are small secreted vesicles that can transfer their content to recipient cells. In cancer, exosome secretion has been implicated in tumor growth and metastatic spread. In this study, we explored the possibility that exosomal pathways might discard tumor-suppressor miRNA that restricts metastatic progression. Secreted miRNA characterized from isogenic bladder carcinoma cell lines with differing metastatic potential were uncoupled from binding to target transcripts or the AGO2-miRISC complex. In metastatic cells, we observed a relative increase in secretion of miRNA with tumor-suppressor functions, including miR23b, miR224, and miR921. Ectopic expression of miR23b inhibited invasion, anoikis, angiogenesis, and pulmonary metastasis. Silencing of the exocytotic RAB family members RAB27A or RAB27B halted miR23b and miR921 secretion and reduced cellular invasion. Clinically, elevated levels of RAB27B expression were linked to poor prognosis in two independent cohorts of patients with bladder cancer. Moreover, highly exocytosed miRNA from metastatic cells, such as miR23b, were reduced in lymph node metastases compared with patient-matched primary tumors and were correlated with increments in miRNA-targeted RNA. Taken together, our results suggested that exosome-mediated secretion of tumor-suppressor miRNA is selected during tumor progression as a mechanism to coordinate activation of a metastatic cascade.

Cell	2014	Stromal communication with cancer cells can influence treatment response. We show that stromal and breast cancer (BrCa) cells utilize paracrine and juxtacrine signaling to drive chemotherapy and radiation resistance. Upon heterotypic interaction, exosomes are transferred from stromal to BrCa cells. RNA within exosomes, which are largely noncoding transcripts and transposable elements, stimulates the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I to activate STAT1-dependent antiviral signaling. In parallel, stromal cells also activate NOTCH3 on BrCa cells. The paracrine antiviral and juxtacrine NOTCH3 pathways converge as STAT1 facilitates transcriptional responses to NOTCH3 and expands therapy-resistant tumor-initiating cells. Primary human and/or mouse BrCa analysis support the role of antiviral/NOTCH3 pathways in NOTCH signaling and stroma-mediated resistance, which is abrogated by combination therapy with gamma secretase inhibitors. Thus, stromal cells orchestrate an intricate crosstalk with BrCa cells by utilizing exosomes to instigate antiviral signaling. This expands BrCa subpopulations adept at resisting therapy and reinitiating tumor growth.	PMC4283810

Differences between disease-associated endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) isoforms in cellular expression, interactions with tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1) and regulation by cytokines.	Clin Exp Immunol	2015	Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) processes peptides for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation and promotes cytokine receptor ectodomain shedding. These known functions of ERAP1 may explain its genetic association with several autoimmune inflammatory diseases. In this study, we identified four novel alternatively spliced variants of ERAP1 mRNA, designated as ΔExon-11, ΔExon-13, ΔExon-14 and ΔExon-15. We also observed a rapid and differential modulation of ERAP1 mRNA levels and spliced variants in different cell types pretreated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We have studied three full-length allelic forms of ERAP1 (R127-K528, P127-K528, P127-R528) and one spliced variant (ΔExon-11) and assessed their interactions with tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1) in transfected cells. We observed variation in cellular expression of different ERAP1 isoforms, with R127-K528 being expressed at a much lower level. Furthermore, the cellular expression of full-length P127-K528 and ΔExon-11 spliced variant was enhanced significantly when co-transfected with TNF-R1. Isoforms P127-K528, P127-R528 and ΔExon-11 spliced variant associated with TNF-R1, and this interaction occurred in a region within the first 10 exons of ERAP1. Supernatant-derived vesicles from transfected cells contained the full-length and ectodomain form of soluble TNF-R1, as well as carrying the full-length ERAP1 isoforms. We observed marginal differences between TNF-R1 ectodomain levels when co-expressed with individual ERAP1 isoforms, and treatment of transfected cells with tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-10 exerted variable effects on TNF-R1 ectodomain cleavage. Our data suggest that ERAP1 isoforms may exhibit differential biological properties and inflammatory mediators could play critical roles in modulating ERAP1 expression, leading to altered functional activities of this enzyme.

Intercellular transfer of messenger RNAs in multiorgan tumorigenesis by tumor cell-derived exosomes.	Mol Med Rep	2015	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles of endocytic origin. They are derived from various cells, including tumor cells, and may serve as important modulators of intercellular communication. The present study established a U‑87 MG human glioblastoma cell line that showed a stable expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP; U‑87‑GFP). Two types of human tumor cell lines, U‑87‑GFP and LoVo human colon cancer cells, were demonstrated to communicate through the transfer of GFP messenger (m)RNA by exosomes. Furthermore, GFP mRNAs delivered by the U‑87‑GFP cell‑derived exosomes were translated into functional proteins in the recipient LoVo cells. In addition, LoVo cells were demonstrated to uptake exosomes derived from the U‑87‑GFP cells by clathrin‑mediated endocytosis. These results indicate that tumor cell‑derived exosomes may represent vesicular carriers that regulate gene expression, which may provide a pathway of intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment during multiorgan tumorigenesis. The exosome uptake pathway may have potential therapeutic applications in multiorgan tumorigenesis.

Cell Commun Signal	2015	BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a common metabolic disorder characterized by dysfunction of insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells. MicroRNAs are important regulators of beta-cell activities. These non-coding RNAs have recently been discovered to exert their effects not only inside the cell producing them but, upon exosome-mediated transfer, also in other recipient cells. This novel communication mode remains unexplored in pancreatic beta-cells. In the present study, the microRNA content of exosomes released by beta-cells in physiological and physiopathological conditions was analyzed and the biological impact of their transfer to recipient cells investigated. RESULTS: Exosomes were isolated from the culture media of MIN6B1 and INS-1 derived 832/13 beta-cell lines and from mice, rat or human islets. Global profiling revealed that the microRNAs released in MIN6B1 exosomes do not simply reflect the content of the cells of origin. Indeed, while a subset of microRNAs was preferentially released in exosomes others were selectively retained in the cells. Moreover, exposure of MIN6B1 cells to inflammatory cytokines changed the release of several microRNAs. The dynamics of microRNA secretion and their potential transfer to recipient cells were next investigated. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that if cel-miR-238, a C. Elegans microRNA not present in mammalian cells, is expressed in MIN6B1 cells a fraction of it is released in exosomes and is transferred to recipient beta-cells. Furthermore, incubation of untreated MIN6B1 or mice islet cells in the presence of microRNA-containing exosomes isolated from the culture media of cytokine-treated MIN6B1 cells triggers apoptosis of recipient cells. In contrast, exosomes originating from cells not exposed to cytokines have no impact on cell survival. Apoptosis induced by exosomes produced by cytokine-treated cells was prevented by down-regulation of the microRNA-mediating silencing protein Ago2 in recipient cells, suggesting that the effect is mediated by the non-coding RNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that beta-cells secrete microRNAs that can be transferred to neighboring beta-cells. Exposure of donor cells to pathophysiological conditions commonly associated with diabetes modifies the release of microRNAs and affects survival of recipient beta-cells. Our results support the concept that exosomal microRNAs transfer constitutes a novel cell-to-cell communication mechanism regulating the activity of pancreatic beta-cells.	PMC4371845

Proteomic Analysis of Extracellular Vesicles Released by Adipocytes of Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) Rats.	Protein J	2015	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes are secretory vesicles that act as autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine messengers; mediate intercellular cross-talk; and carry a cargo of various proteins. Because EVs can be transported to recipient cells via circulation, many researchers have been studying EVs from immune cells or cancer cells. Adipocytes are also considered endocrine cells and secrete adipokines such as adiponectin, regulating a variety of intracellular signaling pathways. Expansion of adipose tissue in obesity alters adipokine secretion, thereby increasing the risk of metabolic diseases. Characterization of adipocyte-derived exosomes is necessary to explain the communication between adipocytes and other cell types. In the present study, to identify proteins associated with adipocyte-derived exosomes, we isolated exosomes from adipose tissue of obese diabetic and obese nondiabetic rats. We identified proteins by analyzing exosomes from obese rats with type 2 diabetes and their matched control littermates using nano-liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry coupled with label-free relative quantification. We identified 509 proteins from adipocytes including 81 known adipokines; ~78% of all the identified proteins were categorized as exosome-associated proteins. Among the protein profiles, we uncovered 128 upregulated and 72 downregulated proteins, which are differentially expressed in OLETF adipocyte-derived exosomes. This study seems to demonstrate for the first time hundreds of proteins in exosomes released by adipocytes in obese rats and rats with type 2 diabetes. Thus, protein profiles of exosomes from adipocytes possibly indicate the transmission of signals as part of cell-cell communication and should further our understanding of obesity- and diabetes-related diseases.

Nanovesicles have also been found in edible-plants and have shown therapeutic activity in inflammatory bowel diseases; however information on their role in affecting cancer progression is missing.Our study identify for the first time a fraction of vesicles from lemon juice (Citrus limon L.), obtained as a result of different ultracentrifugation, with density ranging from 1,15 to 1,19 g/ml and specific proteomic profile. By using an in vitro approach, we show that isolated nanovesicles inhibit cancer cell proliferation in different tumor cell lines, by activating a TRAIL-mediated apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, we demonstrate that lemon nanovesicles suppress CML tumor growth in vivo by specifically reaching tumor site and by activating TRAIL-mediated apoptotic cell processes. Overall, this study suggests the possible use of plant-edible nanovesicles as a feasible approach in cancer treatment.	PMC4637302

Identification of prostate cancer biomarkers in urinary exosomes.	Oncotarget	2015	Exosomes have recently appeared as a novel source of non-invasive cancer biomarkers since tumour-specific molecules can be found in exosomes isolated from biological fluids. We have here investigated the proteome of urinary exosomes by using mass spectrometry to identify proteins differentially expressed in prostate cancer patients compared to healthy male controls. In total, 15 control and 16 prostate cancer samples of urinary exosomes were analyzed. Importantly, 246 proteins were differentially expressed in the two groups. The majority of these proteins (221) were up-regulated in exosomes from prostate cancer patients. These proteins were analyzed according to specific criteria to create a focus list that contained 37 proteins. At 100% specificity, 17 of these proteins displayed individual sensitivities above 60%. Even though several of these proteins showed high sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer as individual biomarkers, combining them in a multi-panel test has the potential for full differentiation of prostate cancer from non-disease controls. The highest sensitivity, 94%, was observed for transmembrane protein 256 (TM256; chromosome 17 open reading frame 61). LAMTOR proteins were also distinctly enriched with very high specificity for patient samples. TM256 and LAMTOR1 could be used to augment the sensitivity to 100%. Other prominent proteins were V-type proton ATPase 16 kDa proteolipid subunit (VATL), adipogenesis regulatory factor (ADIRF), and several Rab-class members and proteasomal proteins. In conclusion, this study clearly shows the potential of using urinary exosomes in the diagnosis and clinical management of prostate cancer.	PMC4745805

Pancreatic cancer-derived exosomes transfer miRNAs to dendritic cells and inhibit RFXAP expression via miR-212-3p.	Oncotarget	2015	It has been reported tumor-derived exosomes can transfer miRNAs to recipient cells in the tumor microenvironment, promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. The present research aimed to explore how pancreatic cancer (PC) derived exosomal miRNAs inhibited mRNA expression of dendritic cells and induced immune tolerance. Our study revealed that 9 PC-related miRNAs were increased and 208 mRNAs were inhibited in exosome-stimulated dendritic cells (exo-iDCs) compared to immature dendritic cells (iDCs). A target prediction between the 9 miRNAs and 208 mRNAs was performed by bioinformatics database analysis. From the target prediction, it was predicted and validated that regulatory factor X-associated protein (RFXAP), an important transcription factor for MHC II, was inhibited by miR-212-3p transferred from PC-secreted exosomes, resulting in decreased MHC II expression. Moreover, a clinical study showed a negative correlation between miR-212-3p and RFXAP in PC tissue. From these data, we concluded that PC-related miRNAs can be transferred to dendritic cells via exosome and inhibit target mRNA expression. More importantly, PC-derived exosomes inhibit RFXAP expression via miR-212-3p, which decrease MHC II expression and induce immune tolerance of dendritic cells. RFXAP deficiency has never been reported in solid tumors. The functions and mechanisms of RFXAP in tumors deserve future explorations.	PMC4745769

Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Protect against Experimental Colitis via Attenuating Colon Inflammation, Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis.	PLoS One	2015	The administration of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) could reverse experimental colitis, and the predominant mechanism in tissue repair seems to be related to their paracrine activity. BMSCs derived extracellular vesicles (BMSC-EVs), including mcirovesicles and exosomes, containing diverse proteins, mRNAs and micro-RNAs, mediating various biological functions, might be a main paracrine mechanism for stem cell to injured cell communication. We aimed to investigate the potential alleviating effects of BMSC-EVs in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis model. Intravenous injection of BMSC-EVs attenuated the severity of colitis as evidenced by decrease of disease activity index (DAI) and histological colonic damage. In inflammation response, the BMSC-EVs treatment significantly reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of nuclear factor kappaBp65 (NF-κBp65), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), induciblenitric oxidesynthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in injured colon. Additionally, the BMSC-EVs injection resulted in a markedly decrease in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and an increase in interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression. Therapeutic effect of BMSC-EVs associated with suppression of oxidative perturbations was manifested by a decrease in the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as an increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). BMSC-EVs also suppressed the apoptosis via reducing the cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 in colitis rats. Data obtained indicated that the beneficial effects of BMSC-EVs were due to the down regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, inhibition of NF-κBp65 signal transduction pathways, modulation of anti-oxidant/ oxidant balance, and moderation of the occurrence of apoptosis.

J Biol Chem	2016	Exosomes regulate cell behavior by binding to and delivering their cargo to target cells; however, the mechanisms mediating exosome-cell interactions are poorly understood. Heparan sulfates on target cell surfaces can act as receptors for exosome uptake, but the ligand for heparan sulfate on exosomes has not been identified. Using exosomes isolated from myeloma cell lines and from myeloma patients, we identify exosomal fibronectin as a key heparan sulfate-binding ligand and mediator of exosome-cell interactions. We discovered that heparan sulfate plays a dual role in exosome-cell interaction; heparan sulfate on exosomes captures fibronectin, and on target cells it acts as a receptor for fibronectin. Removal of heparan sulfate from the exosome surface releases fibronectin and dramatically inhibits exosome-target cell interaction. Antibody specific for the Hep-II heparin-binding domain of fibronectin blocks exosome interaction with tumor cells or with marrow stromal cells. Regarding exosome function, fibronectin-mediated binding of exosomes to myeloma cells activated p38 and pERK signaling and expression of downstream target genes DKK1 and MMP-9, two molecules that promote myeloma progression. Antibody against fibronectin inhibited the ability of myeloma-derived exosomes to stimulate endothelial cell invasion. Heparin or heparin mimetics including Roneparstat, a modified heparin in phase I trials in myeloma patients, significantly inhibited exosome-cell interactions. These studies provide the first evidence that fibronectin binding to heparan sulfate mediates exosome-cell interactions, revealing a fundamental mechanism important for exosome-mediated cross-talk within tumor microenvironments. Moreover, these results imply that therapeutic disruption of fibronectin-heparan sulfate interactions will negatively impact myeloma tumor growth and progression.	PMC4722448

Ann Oncol	2016	BACKGROUND: The ability to perform comprehensive profiling of cancers at high resolution is essential for precision medicine. Liquid biopsies using shed exosomes provide high-quality nucleic acids to obtain molecular characterization, which may be especially useful for visceral cancers that are not amenable to routine biopsies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We isolated shed exosomes in biofluids from three patients with pancreaticobiliary cancers (two pancreatic, one ampullary). We performed comprehensive profiling of exoDNA and exoRNA by whole genome, exome and transcriptome sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer. We assessed the feasibility of calling copy number events, detecting mutational signatures and identifying potentially actionable mutations in exoDNA sequencing data, as well as expressed point mutations and gene fusions in exoRNA sequencing data. RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing resulted in 95%-99% of the target regions covered at a mean depth of 133-490×. Genome-wide copy number profiles, and high estimates of tumor fractions (ranging from 56% to 82%), suggest robust representation of the tumor DNA within the shed exosomal compartment. Multiple actionable mutations, including alterations in NOTCH1 and BRCA2, were found in patient exoDNA samples. Further, RNA sequencing of shed exosomes identified the presence of expressed fusion genes, representing an avenue for elucidation of tumor neoantigens. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated high-resolution profiling of the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of visceral cancers. A wide range of cancer-derived biomarkers could be detected within the nucleic acid cargo of shed exosomes, including copy number profiles, point mutations, insertions, deletions, gene fusions and mutational signatures. Liquid biopsies using shed exosomes has the potential to be used as a clinical tool for cancer diagnosis, therapeutic stratification and treatment monitoring, precluding the need for direct tumor sampling.

Comprehensive Proteomic Analysis of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Exosomes Reveals Modulation of Angiogenesis via Nuclear Factor-KappaB Signaling.	Stem Cells	2016	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are known to facilitate healing of ischemic tissue related diseases through proangiogenic secretory proteins. Recent studies further show that MSC derived exosomes function as paracrine effectors of angiogenesis, however, the identity of which components of the exosome proteome responsible for this effect remains elusive. To address this we used high-resolution isoelectric focusing coupled liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, an unbiased high throughput proteomics approach to comprehensively characterize the proteinaceous contents of MSCs and MSC derived exosomes. We probed the proteome of MSCs and MSC derived exosomes from cells cultured under expansion conditions and under ischemic tissue simulated conditions to elucidate key angiogenic paracrine effectors present and potentially differentially expressed in these conditions. In total, 6,342 proteins were identified in MSCs and 1,927 proteins in MSC derived exosomes, representing to our knowledge the first time these proteomes have been probed comprehensively. Multilayered analyses identified several putative paracrine effectors of angiogenesis present in MSC exosomes and increased in expression in MSCs exposed to ischemic tissue-simulated conditions; these include platelet derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and most notably nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkB) signaling pathway proteins. NFkB signaling was identified as a key mediator of MSC exosome induced angiogenesis in endothelial cells by functional in vitro validation using a specific inhibitor. Collectively, the results of our proteomic analysis show that MSC derived exosomes contain a robust profile of angiogenic paracrine effectors, which have potential for the treatment of ischemic tissue-related diseases.

Tumour Biol	2016	Prognosis of lung cancer still remains grim largely due to recurrence and aggressive metastasis of the disease. In this study, we examined the potential of exosomal miRNAs as biomarkers of recurrent lung cancer. Initially, in vitro miRNA profiles of normal lung (Beas-2b) and lung cancer (H1299) cells and of exosomes isolated from conditioned media were determined. In vivo study involved establishing subcutaneous primary and recurrent lung cancer xenografts in nude mouse model and examining tumor and serum exosomal miRNA alteration in secondary/recurrent lung tumors. A total of 77 miRNAs were observed to be significantly modulated in the H1299 cells (47 miRNA upregulated and 30 downregulated) compared to the Beas-2b cells. The exosomes isolated from conditioned media indicated several miRNAs which were in agreement with cells of origin. A similarity was also observed between miRNAs from serum exosomes and tumors, indicating their origin from the lung tumors. Two miRNAs, miR-21 and miR-155, were found to be significantly upregulated in recurrent tumors compared to primary tumors. These miRNAs were also upregulated in serum exosomes of recurrent tumor-bearing animals versus non-tumor- or primary tumor-bearing animals. Increased expression of the recurrent disease markers were also observed in recurrent tumors compared with primary tumors. Serum exosomes from recurrent tumor mice mirrored its tumor profile in expressing higher levels of these proteins compared with exosomes from primary tumor mice. Our data suggest that exosomal miRNA signatures may be a true representation of a pathological profile of lung cancer; thus, miRNAs could serve as promising biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of the disease.

Pathways for Modulating Exosome Lipids Identified By High-Density Lipoprotein-Like Nanoparticle Binding to Scavenger Receptor Type B-1.	Sci Rep	2016	Exosomes are produced by cells to mediate intercellular communication, and have been shown to perpetuate diseases, including cancer. New tools are needed to understand exosome biology, detect exosomes from specific cell types in complex biological media, and to modify exosomes. Our data demonstrate a cellular pathway whereby membrane-bound scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1) in parent cells becomes incorporated into exosomes. We tailored synthetic HDL-like nanoparticles (HDL NP), high-affinity ligands for SR-B1, to carry a fluorescently labeled phospholipid. Data show SR-B1-dependent transfer of the fluorescent phospholipid from HDL NPs to exosomes. Modified exosomes are stable in serum and can be directly detected using flow cytometry. As proof-of-concept, human serum exosomes were found to express SR-B1, and HDL NPs can be used to label and isolate them. Ultimately, we discovered a natural cellular pathway and nanoparticle-receptor pair that enables exosome modulation, detection, and isolation.	PMC4786789

Arthritis Res Ther	2016	BACKGROUND: Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id1) is a nuclear protein containing a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain that regulates cell growth by selective binding and prevention of gene transcription. Sources of Id1 production in rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue (RA ST) and its range of functional effects in RA remain to be clarified. METHODS: We analyzed Id1 produced from synovial fibroblasts and endothelial cells (ECs) with histology and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Fibroblast supernatants subjected to differential centrifugation to isolate and purify exosomes were measured for Id1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western blotting of Id1-stimulated ECs was performed to determine the kinetics of intracellular protein phosphorylation. EC intracellular signaling pathways induced by Id1 were subsequently targeted with silencing RNA (siRNA) for angiogenesis inhibition. RESULTS: By PCR and histologic analysis, we found that the primary source of Id1 in STs is from activated fibroblasts that correlate with inflammatory scores in human RA ST and in joints from K/BxN serum-induced mice. Normal (NL) and RA synovial fibroblasts increase Id1 production with stimulation by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). Most of the Id1 released by RA synovial fibroblasts is contained within exosomes. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and human dermal microvascular ECs (HMVECs) activate the Jnk signaling pathway in response to Id1, and Jnk siRNA reverses Id1-induced HMVEC vessel formation in Matrigel plugs in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Id1 is a pleotropic molecule affecting angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and fibrosis. Our data shows that Id1 is not only an important nuclear protein, but also can be released from fibroblasts via exosomes. The ability of extracellular Id1 to activate signaling pathways expands the role of Id1 in the orchestration of tissue inflammation.	PMC4830090

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in Prostate Cancer Derived Exosomes.	PLoS One	2016	Exosomes proteins and microRNAs have gained much attention as diagnostic tools and biomarker potential in various malignancies including prostate cancer (PCa). However, the role of exosomes and membrane-associated receptors, particularly epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as mediators of cell proliferation and invasion in PCa progression remains unexplored. EGFR is frequently overexpressed and has been associated with aggressive forms of PCa. While PCa cells and tissues express EGFR, it is unknown whether exosomes derived from PCa cells or PCa patient serum contains EGFR. The aim of this study was to detect and characterize EGFR in exosomes derived from PCa cells, LNCaP xenograft and PCa patient serum. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media of different PCa cell lines; LNCaP xenograft serum as well as patient plasma/serum by differential centrifugation and ultracentrifugation on a sucrose density gradient. Exosomes were confirmed by electron microscopy, expression of exosomal markers and NanoSight™ analysis. EGFR expression was determined by western blot analysis and ELISA. This study demonstrates that exosomes may easily be derived from PCa cell lines, serum obtained from PCa xenograft bearing mice and clinical samples derived from PCa patients. Presence of exosomal EGFR in PCa patient exosomes may present a novel approach for measuring of the disease state. Our work will allow to build on this finding for future understanding of PCa exosomes and their potential role in PCa progression and as minimal invasive biomarkers for PCa.	PMC4859494

Mesenchymal Stem Cells Deliver Exogenous MicroRNA-let7c via Exosomes to Attenuate Renal Fibrosis.	Mol Ther	2016	The advancement of microRNA (miRNA) therapies has been hampered by difficulties in delivering miRNA to the injured kidney in a robust and sustainable manner. Using bioluminescence imaging in mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), we report that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), engineered to overexpress miRNA-let7c (miR-let7c-MSCs), selectively homed to damaged kidneys and upregulated miR-let7c gene expression, compared with nontargeting control (NTC)-MSCs. miR-let7c-MSC therapy attenuated kidney injury and significantly downregulated collagen IVα1, metalloproteinase-9, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and TGF-β type 1 receptor (TGF-βR1) in UUO kidneys, compared with controls. In vitro analysis confirmed that the transfer of miR-let7c from miR-let7c-MSCs occurred via secreted exosomal uptake, visualized in NRK52E cells using cyc3-labeled pre-miRNA-transfected MSCs with/without the exosomal inhibitor, GW4869. The upregulated expression of fibrotic genes in NRK52E cells induced by TGF-β1 was repressed following the addition of isolated exosomes or indirect coculture of miR-let7c-MSCs, compared with NTC-MSCs. Furthermore, the cotransfection of NRK52E cells using the 3'UTR of TGF-βR1 confirmed that miR-let7c attenuates TGF-β1-driven TGF-βR1 gene expression. Taken together, the effective antifibrotic function of engineered MSCs is able to selectively transfer miR-let7c to damaged kidney cells and will pave the way for the use of MSCs for therapeutic delivery of miRNA targeted at kidney disease.

Amoxicillin haptenates intracellular proteins that can be transported in exosomes to target cells.	Allergy	2017	BACKGROUND: Allergic reactions to β-lactams are among the most frequent causes of drug allergy and constitute an important clinical problem. Drug covalent binding to endogenous proteins (haptenation) is thought to be required for activation of the immune system. Nevertheless, neither the nature nor the role of the drug protein targets involved in this process is fully understood. Here, we aim to identify novel intracellular targets for haptenation by amoxicillin (AX) and their cellular fate. METHODS: We have treated B lymphocytes with either AX or a biotinylated analog (AX-B). The identification of protein targets for haptenation by AX has been approached by mass spectrometry and immunoaffinity techniques. In addition, intercellular communication mediated by the delivery of vesicles loaded with AX-B-protein adducts has been explored by microscopy techniques. RESULTS: We have observed a complex pattern of AX-haptenated proteins. Several novel targets for haptenation by AX in B lymphocytes have been identified. AX-haptenated proteins were detected in cell lysates and extracellularly, either as soluble proteins or in lymphocyte-derived extracellular vesicles. Interestingly, exosomes from AX-B-treated cells showed a positive biotin signal in electron microscopy. Moreover, they were internalized by endothelial cells, thus supporting their involvement in intercellular transfer of haptenated proteins. CONCLUSIONS: These results represent the first identification of AX-mediated haptenation of intracellular proteins. Moreover, they show that exosomes can constitute a novel vehicle for haptenated proteins, and raise the hypothesis that they could provide antigens for activation of the immune system during the allergic response.

Circulating exosomes potentiate tumor malignant properties in a mouse model of chronic sleep fragmentation.	Oncotarget	2016	BACKGROUND: Chronic sleep fragmentation (SF) increases cancer aggressiveness in mice. Exosomes exhibit pleiotropic biological functions, including immune regulatory functions, antigen presentation, intracellular communication and inter-cellular transfer of RNA and proteins. We hypothesized that SF-induced alterations in biosynthesis and cargo of plasma exosomes may affect tumor cell properties. RESULTS: SF-derived exosomes increased tumor cell proliferation (~13%), migration (~2.3-fold) and extravasation (~10%) when compared to exosomes from SC-exposed mice. Similarly, Pre exosomes from OSA patients significantly enhanced proliferation and migration of human adenocarcinoma cells compared to Post. SF-exosomal cargo revealed 3 discrete differentially expressed miRNAs, and exploration of potential mRNA targets in TC1 tumor cells uncovered 132 differentially expressed genes that encode for multiple cancer-related pathways. METHODS: Plasma-derived exosomes from C57/B6 mice exposed to 6 wks of SF or sleep control (SC), and from adult human patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) before (Pre) and after adherent treatment for 6 wks (Post) were co-cultured with mouse lung TC1 or human adenocarcinoma tumor cell lines, respectively. Proliferation, migration, invasion, endothelial barrier integrity and extravasation assays of tumor cells were performed. Plasma mouse exosomal miRNAs were profiled with arrays, and transcriptomic assessments of TC1 cells exposed to SF or SC exosomes were conducted to identify gene targets. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic SF induces alterations in exosomal miRNA cargo that alter the biological properties of TC1 lung tumor cells to enhance their proliferative, migratory and extravasation properties, and similar findings occur in OSA patients, in whom SF is a constitutive component of their sleep disorder. Thus, exosomes could participate, at least in part, in the adverse cancer outcomes observed in OSA.	PMC5342372

Epigenetics	2016	Breastmilk has many documented beneficial effects on the developing human infant, but the components of breastmilk that influence these developmental pathways have not been fully elucidated. Increasing evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent an important mechanism of communication between the mother and child. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are of particular interest given their key role in gene expression and development. However, it is not known whether breastmilk EVs contain lncRNAs. We used qRT-PCR to determine whether EVs isolated from human breastmilk contain lncRNAs previously reported to be important for developmental processes. We detected 55 of the 87 screened lncRNAs in EVs from the 30 analyzed breastmilk samples, and CRNDE, DANCR GAS5, SRA1 and ZFAS1 were detected in >90% of the samples. GAS5, SNHG8 and ZFAS1 levels were highly correlated (Spearman's rho>0.9; P<0.0001), which may indicate that the loading of these lncRNAs into breastmilk EVs is regulated by the same pathways. The detected lncRNAs are important epigenetic regulators involved in processes such as immune cell regulation and metabolism. They may target a repertoire of recipient cells in offspring and could be essential for child development and health. Further experimental and epidemiological studies are warranted to determine the impact of breastmilk EV-encapsulated lnRNAs in mother to child signaling.	PMC5094628

Eur J Pharm Sci	2017	Exosomes have recently appeared as a novel source of non-invasive cancer biomarkers since tumor-specific molecules can be found in exosomes isolated from biological fluids. We have previously analyzed the proteome of urinary exosomes by mass spectrometry, and identified proteins differentially expressed in prostate cancer patients compared to healthy males. Since mass spectrometry is so far not commonly used in clinical laboratories, we have here investigated whether antibody-based methods such as Western blot or ELISA can be used to validate the use of the identified proteins as prostate cancer biomarkers. Western blot experiments designed to detect flotillin 2, TMEM256, Rab3B and LAMTOR1 showed that the level of these proteins was higher in urinary exosomes from prostate cancer patients compared to healthy males. Furthermore, a receiver operating characteristic curve of flotillin 2 in samples from 16 controls and 16 patients showed an area under the curve of 0.91, and 88% sensitivity at a threshold set to give 94% specificity. In addition, ELISA-based detection of flotillin 2 and PARK7 showed that the combination of these proteins was able to distinguish prostate cancer patients and healthy controls with 68% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Several promising biomarkers identified by mass spectrometry could not be evaluated by Western blot or ELISA due to their low exosomal amount and/or lack of good antibodies. In conclusion, our results show that several urinary exosomal proteins identified as prostate cancer biomarkers by mass spectrometry have a high diagnostic value also when analyzed by immunology-based methods, thus bringing these biomarkers closer to a potential clinical use.

The distinct traits of extracellular vesicles generated by transformed cells.	Small GTPases	2016	Intercellular communication mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane-enclosed packages released by cells, plays important roles in several physiological and pathological settings. Moreover, EVs have been shown to contain molecular signatures that reflect their cell of origin, raising the possibility that EV cargo could potentially be used to diagnose disease. However, for this to occur, a better understanding of the differences between EVs generated by normal and diseased cells is needed. We recently discovered that the content and function of one major class of EVs, microvesicles (MVs), changes upon the induction of oncogenic transformation. Specifically, we found that MVs derived from fibroblasts induced to express an oncogenic form of Dbl (onco-Dbl) are highly enriched in the activated form of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The FAK associated with these MVs can be transferred to normal recipient cells, where it stimulates signaling events that induce a transformed-like phenotype. We further showed that MVs from several breast cancer cell lines, but not their normal counterparts, similarly contained FAK. Thus, the enrichment of a specific cargo in MVs from transformed/cancer cells may help promote cancer progression, as well as potentially serve as an early and sensitive indicator of disease.

J Virol	2017	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 2 to 3% of the world population and is a leading cause of liver diseases such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Many aspects of HCV study, ranging from molecular virology and antiviral drug development to drug resistance profiling, were supported by straightforward assays of HCV replication and infection. Among these assays, the HCV-dependent fluorescence relocalization (HDFR) system allowed live-cell visualization of infection without modifying the viral genome, but this strategy required careful recognition of the fluorescence relocalization pattern for its high fluorescence background in the cytoplasm. In this study, to achieve background-free visualization of HCV infection, a viral infection-activated split-intein-mediated reporter system (VISI) was devised. Uninfected Huh7.5.1-VISI cells show no background signal, while HCV infection specifically illuminates the nuclei of infected Huh7.5.1-VISI cells with either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or mCherry. Combining VISI-GFP and VISI-mCherry systems, we revisited HCV cell-to-cell transmission with clear-cut distinction of donor and recipient cells in a live-cell manner. Independently of virion assembly, exosomes have been reported to transfer HCV subgenomic RNA to initiate replication in uninfected cells, which suggested an assembly-free pathway. However, our data demonstrated that HCV structural genes and the p7 gene were essential for not only cell-free infectivity but also cell-to-cell transmission. Additionally, depletion of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from donor cells but not from recipient cells significantly reduced HCV cell-to-cell transmission efficiency. In summary, we developed a background-free cell-based reporter system for convenient live-cell visualization of HCV infection, and our data indicate that complete HCV virion assembly machinery is essential for both cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission. IMPORTANCE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects hepatocytes via two pathways: cell-free infection and cell-to-cell transmission. Structural modules of the HCV genome are required for production of infectious cell-free virions; however, the role of specific genes within the structural module in cell-to-cell transmission is not clearly defined. Our data demonstrate that deletion of core, E1E2, and p7 genes individually results in no HCV cell-to-cell transmission and that ApoE knockdown from donor cells causes less-efficient cell-to-cell transmission. Thus, this work indicates that the complete HCV assembly machinery is required for HCV cell-to-cell transmission. At last, this work presents an optimized viral infection-activated split-intein-mediated reporter system for easy live-cell monitoring of HCV infection.	PMC5215325

Mol Cell Neurosci	2017	HIV-infected brains are characterized by increased amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition. It is believed that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is critical for Aβ homeostasis and contributes to Aβ accumulation in the brain. Extracellular vesicles (ECV), like exosomes, recently gained a lot of attention as potentially playing a significant role in Aβ pathology. In addition, HIV-1 hijacks the exosomal pathway for budding and release. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of BBB-derived ECV in the HIV-1-induced Aβ pathology in the brain. Our results indicate that HIV-1 increases ECV release from brain endothelial cells as well as elevates their Aβ cargo when compared to controls. Interestingly, brain endothelial cell-derived ECV transferred Aβ to astrocytes and pericytes. Infusion of brain endothelial ECV carrying fluorescent Aβ into the internal carotid artery of mice resulted in Aβ fluorescence associated with brain microvessels and in the brain parenchyma. These results suggest that ECV carrying Aβ can be successfully transferred across the BBB into the brain. Based on these observations, we conclude that HIV-1 facilitates the shedding of brain endothelial ECV carrying Aβ; a process that may increase Aβ exposure of cells of neurovascular unit, and contribute to amyloid deposition in HIV-infected brain.

Exosomal biomarkers of brain insulin resistance associated with regional atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.	Hum Brain Mapp	2017	Brain insulin resistance (IR), which depends on insulin-receptor-substrate-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation, is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we demonstrated higher pSer312-IRS-1 (ineffective insulin signaling) and lower p-panTyr-IRS-1 (effective insulin signaling) in neural origin-enriched plasma exosomes of AD patients vs. CONTROLS: Here, we hypothesized that these exosomal biomarkers associate with brain atrophy in AD. We studied 24 subjects with biomarker-supported probable AD (low CSF Aβ42 ). Exosomes were isolated from plasma, enriched for neural origin using immunoprecipitation for L1CAM, and measured for pSer312 - and p-panTyr-IRS-1 phosphotypes. MPRAGE images were segmented by brain tissue type and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis for gray matter against pSer312 - and p-panTyr-IRS-1 was conducted. Given the regionally variable brain expression of IRS-1, we used the Allen Brain Atlas to make spatial comparisons between VBM results and IRS-1 expression. Brain volume was positively associated with P-panTyr-IRS-1 and negatively associated with pSer312 -IRS-1 in a strikingly similar regional pattern (bilateral parietal-occipital junction, R middle temporal gyrus). This volumetric association pattern was spatially correlated with Allen Human Brain atlas normal brain IRS-1 expression. Exosomal biomarkers of brain IR are thus associated with atrophy in AD as could be expected by their pathophysiological roles and do so in a pattern that reflects regional IRS-1 expression. Furthermore, neural-origin plasma exosomes may recover molecular signals from specific brain regions. Hum Brain Mapp 38:1933-1940, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	PMC5342917

J Cell Sci	2017	Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ that can secrete a wide number of factors to regulate adipogenesis via paracrine signals. In addition to soluble proteins in adipose tissue, microRNAs (miRNAs) enriched in extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes or microvesicles, could modulate intercellular communications. In this study, we demonstrated that exosome-like vesicles derived from adipose tissue (Exo-AT) were internalized by adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs), and that these, in turn, induced adipogenesis. High-throughput sequencing showed that 45 miRNAs were enriched in Exo-AT, and 31.11% of them were associated with adipogenesis, compared with ADSC-derived exosome-like vesicles (Exo-ADSC). miR-450a-5p, one of the most abundant miRNAs in Exo-AT, was a proadipogenic miRNA. Further study demonstrated that miR-450a-5p promoted adipogenesis through repressing expression of WISP2 by targeting its 3' untranslated region. Additionally, Exo-AT could also downregulate the expression of WISP2, while miR-450a-5p inhibitor reversed this effect. Moreover, inhibition of miR-450a-5p impaired adipogenesis mediated by exosome-like vesicles. In conclusion, Exo-AT mediates adipogenic differentiation through a mechanism involving transfer of miR-450a-5p.

First Characterization of Human Amniotic Fluid Stem Cell Extracellular Vesicles as a Powerful Paracrine Tool Endowed with Regenerative Potential.	Stem Cells Transl Med	2017	Human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFS) have shown a distinct secretory profile and significant regenerative potential in several preclinical models of disease. Nevertheless, little is known about the detailed characterization of their secretome. Herein we show for the first time that hAFS actively release extracellular vesicles (EV) endowed with significant paracrine potential and regenerative effect. c-KIT+ hAFS were isolated from leftover samples of amniotic fluid from prenatal screening and stimulated to enhance EV release (24 hours 20% O2 versus 1% O2 preconditioning). The capacity of the c-KIT+ hAFS-derived EV (hAFS-EV) to induce proliferation, survival, immunomodulation, and angiogenesis were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The hAFS-EV regenerative potential was also assessed in a model of skeletal muscle atrophy (HSA-Cre, SmnF7/F7 mice), in which mouse AFS transplantation was previously shown to enhance muscle strength and survival. hAFS secreted EV ranged from 50 up to 1,000 nm in size. In vitro analysis defined their role as biological mediators of regenerative, paracrine effects while their modulatory role in decreasing skeletal muscle inflammation in vivo was shown for the first time. Hypoxic preconditioning significantly induced the enrichment of exosomes endowed with regenerative microRNAs within the hAFS-EV. In conclusion, this is the first study showing that c-KIT+ hAFS dynamically release EV endowed with remarkable paracrine potential, thus representing an appealing tool for future regenerative therapy.

Multispectral Optical Tweezers for Biochemical Fingerprinting of CD9-Positive Exosome Subpopulations.	Anal Chem	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, are circulating nanoscale particles heavily implicated in cell signaling and can be isolated in vast numbers from human biofluids. Study of their molecular profiling and materials properties is currently underway for purposes of describing a variety of biological functions and diseases. However, the large, and as yet largely unquantified, variety of EV subpopulations differing in composition, size, and likely function necessitates characterization schemes capable of measuring single vesicles. Here we describe the first application of multispectral optical tweezers (MS-OTs) to single vesicles for molecular fingerprinting of EV subpopulations. This versatile imaging platform allows for sensitive measurement of Raman chemical composition (e.g., variation in protein, lipid, cholesterol, nucleic acids), coupled with discrimination by fluorescence markers. For exosomes isolated by ultracentrifugation, we use MS-OTs to interrogate the CD9-positive subpopulations via antibody fluorescence labeling and Raman spectra measurement. We report that the CD9-positive exosome subset exhibits reduced component concentration per vesicle and reduced chemical heterogeneity compared to the total purified EV population. We observed that specific vesicle subpopulations are present across exosomes isolated from cell culture supernatant of several clonal varieties of mesenchymal stromal cells and also from plasma and ascites isolated from human ovarian cancer patients.

J Am Soc Nephrol	2017	Muscle atrophy is a frequent complication of CKD, and exercise can attenuate the process. This study investigated the role of microRNA-23a (miR-23a) and miR-27a in the regulation of muscle mass in mice with CKD. These miRs are located in a gene cluster that is regulated by the transcription factor NFAT. CKD mice expressed less miR-23a in muscle than controls, and resistance exercise (muscle overload) increased the levels of miR-23a and miR-27a in CKD mice. Injection of an adeno-associated virus encoding the miR-23a/27a/24-2 precursor RNA into the tibialis anterior muscles of normal and CKD mice led to increases in mature miR-23a and miR-27a but not miR-24-2 in the muscles of both cohorts. Overexpression of miR-23a/miR-27a in CKD mice attenuated muscle loss, improved grip strength, increased the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1, and decreased the activation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and FoxO1 and the expression of TRIM63/MuRF1 and FBXO32/atrogin-1 proteins. Provision of miR-23a/miR-27a also reduced myostatin expression and downstream SMAD-2/3 signaling, decreased activation of caspase-3 and -7, and increased the expression of markers of muscle regeneration. Lastly, in silico miR target analysis and luciferase reporter assays in primary satellite cells identified PTEN and caspase-7 as targets of miR-23a and FoxO1 as a target of miR-27a in muscle. These findings provide new insights about the roles of the miR-23a/27a-24-2 cluster in CKD-induced muscle atrophy in mice and suggest a mechanism by which exercise helps to maintain muscle mass.

Int J Nanomedicine	2017	Exosomes are cell-derived nanovesicles that hold promise as living vehicles for intracellular delivery of therapeutics to mammalian cells. This potential, however, is undermined by the lack of effective methods to load exosomes with therapeutic proteins and to facilitate their uptake by target cells. Here, we demonstrate how a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) can both load protein cargo onto exosomes and increase their delivery ability via a pseudotyping mechanism. By fusing a set of fluorescent and luminescent reporters with VSVG, we show the successful targeting and incorporation of VSVG fusions into exosomes by gene transfection and fluorescence tracking. We subsequently validate our system by live cell imaging of VSVG and its participation in endosomes/exosomes that are ultimately released from transfected HEK293 cells. We show that VSVG pseudotyping of exosomes does not affect the size or distributions of the exosomes, and both the full-length VSVG and the VSVG without the ectodomain are shown to integrate into the exosomal membrane, suggesting that the ectodomain is not required for protein loading. Finally, exosomes pseudotyped with full-length VSVG are internalized by multiple-recipient cell types to a greater degree compared to exosomes loaded with VSVG without the ectodomain, confirming a role of the ectodomain in cell tropism. In summary, our work introduces a new genetically encoded pseudotyping platform to load and enhance the intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins via exosome-based vehicles to target cells.

Stem Cell Res Ther	2017	BACKGROUND: We previously reported that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess therapeutic effects in a murine model of carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver failure. In the study, we observed that the majority of repopulated hepatocytes were of recipient origin and were adjacent to transplanted MSCs; only a low percentage of repopulated hepatocytes were from transplanted MSCs. The findings indicate that MSCs guided the formation of new hepatocytes. Exosomes are important messengers for paracrine signaling delivery. The aim of this study is to investigate the paracrine effects, in particular, the effects of exosomes from MSCs, on hepatocytes. METHODS: Mature hepatocytes were isolated from murine liver by a two-step perfusion method with collagenase digestion. MSCs were obtained from murine bone marrow, and conditioned medium (CM) from MSC culture was then collected. Time-lapse imaging was used for observation of cell morphological change induced by CM on hepatocytes. In addition, expression of markers for hepatic progenitors including oval cells, intrahepatic stem cells, and hepatoblasts were analyzed. RESULTS: Treatment with the CM promoted the formation of small oval cells from hepatocytes; time-lapse imaging demonstrated the change from epithelial to oval cell morphology at the single hepatocyte level. Additionally, expression of EpCAM and OC2, markers of hepatic oval cells, was upregulated. Also, the number of EpCAMhigh cells was increased after CM treatment. The EpCAMhigh small oval cells possessed colony-formation ability; they also expressed cytokeratin 18 and were able to store glycogen upon induction of hepatic differentiation. Furthermore, exosomes from MSC-CM could induce the conversion of mature hepatocytes to EpCAMhigh small oval cells. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, paracrine signaling through exosomes from MSCs induce the conversion of hepatocytes into hepatic oval cells, a mechanism of action which has not been reported regarding the therapeutic potentials of MSCs in liver regeneration. Exosomes from MSCs may therefore be used to treat liver diseases. Further studies are required for proof of concept of this approach.	PMC5442870

Sci Rep	2017	The physiological role of miRNAs is widely understood to include fine-tuning the post-transcriptional regulation of a wide array of biological processes. Extensive studies have indicated that exosomal miRNAs in the bodily fluids of various organisms can be transferred between living cells for the delivery of gene silencing signals. Here, we illustrated the expression characteristics of exosomal miRNAs in giant panda breast milk during distinct lactation periods and highlighted the enrichment of immune- and development-related endogenous miRNAs in colostral and mature giant panda milk. These miRNAs are stable, even under certain harsh conditions, via the protection of extracellular vesicles. These findings indicate that breast milk may facilitate the dietary intake of maternal miRNAs by infants for the regulation of postnatal development. We also detected exogenous plant miRNAs from the primary food source of the giant panda (bamboo) in the exosomes of giant panda breast milk that were associated with regulatory roles in basic metabolism and neuron development. This result suggested that dietary plant miRNAs are absorbed by host cells and subsequently secreted into bodily fluids as potential cross-kingdom regulators. In conclusion, exosomal miRNAs in giant panda breast milk may be crucial maternal regulators for the development of intrinsic 'slink' newborn cubs.	PMC5471263

Tongxinluo Inhibits Renal Fibrosis in Diabetic Nephropathy: Involvement of the Suppression of Intercellular Transfer of TGF-[Formula: see text]1-Containing Exosomes from GECs to GMCs.	Am J Chin Med	2017	Glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Our previous study revealed that high glucose (HG)-treated glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) produce an increased number of TGF-[Formula: see text]1-containing exosomes to activate GMCs through the TGF-[Formula: see text]1/Smad3 signaling pathway. We also identified that Tongxinluo (TXL), a traditional Chinese medicine, has beneficial effects on the treatment of DN in DN patients and type 2 diabetic mice. However, it remained elusive whether TXL could ameliorate renal structure and function through suppression of intercellular transfer of TGF-[Formula: see text]1-containing exosomes from GECs to GMCs. In this study, we demonstrate that TXL can inhibit the secretion of TGF-[Formula: see text]1-containing exosomes from HG-treated GECs. Furthermore, exosomes produced by HG induced-GECs treated with TXL cannot trigger GMC activation, proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) overproduction both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that TXL can prevent the transfer of TGF-[Formula: see text]1 from GECs to GMCs via exosomes, which may be one of the mechanisms of TXL in the treatment of DN.

Proteomic Analysis of Neuroblastoma-Derived Exosomes: New Insights into a Metastatic Signature.	Proteomics	2017	Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial pediatric solid tumor. Around 70% of patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis present bone-marrow infiltration, which is considered a marker of poor outcome; however, the mechanism underlying this specific tropism has to be elucidated. Tumor-derived exosomes may support metastatic progression in several tumors by interacting with the microenvironment, and may serve as tumor biomarkers. The main objective of this study is to identify an exosomal signature associated with NB metastatic bone-marrow dissemination. Therefore, the proteomic cargo of exosomes isolated from NB cell lines derived from primary tumor and bone-marrow metastasis is characterized. The comparison among exosomal proteins show 15 proteins exclusively present in primary tumor-derived exosomes, mainly involved in neuronal development, and 6 proteins in metastasis-derived exosomes related to cancer progression. Significant proteins obtain with statistical analysis performed between the two groups, reveal that primary tumor exosomes contain a higher level of proteins involved in extra-cellular matrix (ECM) assembly and adhesion, as well as in neuronal development. Exosomes isolated from bone-marrow metastasis exhibit proteins involved in ameboidal cell migration and mitochondrial activity. This work suggests that proteomic profiling of NB-derived exosomes reflects the tumor stage and may be considered as potential tumor biomarker.

Mesenchymal stem cells deliver exogenous miR-21 via exosomes to inhibit nucleus pulposus cell apoptosis and reduce intervertebral disc degeneration.	J Cell Mol Med	2018	Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation into the IVD (intervertebral disc) may be beneficial in inhibiting apoptosis of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) and alleviating IVD degeneration, the underlying mechanism of this therapeutic process has not been fully explained. The purpose of this study was to explore the protective effect of MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-exosomes) on NPC apoptosis and IVD degeneration and investigate the regulatory effect of miRNAs in MSC-exosomes and associated mechanisms for NPC apoptosis. MSC-exosomes were isolated from MSC medium, and its anti-apoptotic effect was assessed in a cell and rat model. The down-regulated miRNAs in apoptotic NPCs were identified, and their contents in MSC-exosomes were detected. The target genes of eligible miRNAs and possible downstream pathway were investigated. Purified MSC-exosomes were taken up by NPCs and suppressed NPC apoptosis. The levels of miR-21 were down-regulated in apoptotic NPCs while MSC-exosomes were enriched in miR-21. The exosomal miR-21 could be transferred into NPCs and alleviated TNF-α induced NPC apoptosis by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. Intradiscal injection of MSC-exosomes alleviated the NPC apoptosis and IVD degeneration in the rat model. In conclusion, MSC-derived exosomes prevent NPCs from apoptotic process and alleviate IVD degeneration, at least partly, via miR-21 contained in exosomes. Exosomal miR-21 restrains PTEN and thus activates PI3K/Akt pathway in apoptotic NPCs. Our work confers a promising therapeutic strategy for IVD degeneration.	PMC5742691

J Immunol	2017	Exosomes are lipid nanovesicles released after fusion of the endosomal limiting membrane with the plasma membrane. In this study, we investigated the requirement for CD4 T cells, B cells, and NK cells to provide help for CD8 T cell-mediated response to B cell-derived exosomes. CTL responses to Ag-loaded exosomes were dependent on host MHC class I, with a critical role for splenic langerin+ CD8α+ dendritic cells (DCs) in exosomal Ag cross-presentation. In addition, there was an absolute dependence on the presence of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and NK cells, where the loss of any one of these subsets led to a complete loss of CTL response. Interestingly, NK cell depletion experiments demonstrated a critical cutoff point for depletion efficacy, with low-level residual NK cells providing sufficient help to allow optimal CD8 T cell proliferative responses to exosomal protein. Despite the potential role for B cells in the response to B cell-derived exosomal proteins, B cell depletion did not alter the exosome-induced CTL response. Similarly, a possible role for the BCR or circulating Ab in mediating CTL responses to B cell-derived exosomes was ruled out using DHLMP2A mice, which lack secreted and membrane-bound Ab, yet harbor marginal zone and follicular B cells. In contrast, CTL responses to DC-derived exosomes were significantly inhibited within Ab-deficient DHLMP2A mice compared with wild-type mice. However, this response was not restored upon serum transfer, implicating a role for the BCR, but not circulating Ab, in DC-derived exosome responses.

Sci Rep	2017	Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) induces inflammatory responses, and effective endogenous homeostasis is important for preventing systemic inflammation. We assessed whether plasma exosomal microRNAs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB are involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. Plasma samples were isolated from CPB patients (n = 21) at 5 specified time points: pre-surgery, pre-CPB and 2 hours (h), 4 h and 24 h after CPB began. Plasma TNF-α expression was increased after CPB began compared to that in the pre-surgery samples. Plasma IL-8 and IL-6 expression peaked at 4 h after CPB began but was downregulated at 24 h. The number of plasma exosomes collected at 2 h (55.1 ± 8.3%), 4 h (63.8 ± 10.1%) and 24 h (83.5 ± 3.72%) after CPB began was significantly increased compared to that in the pre-CPB samples (42.8 ± 0.11%). These exosomes had a predominantly parental cellular origin from RBCs and platelets. Additionally, the plasma exosomal miR-223 levels were significantly increased after CPB began compared to those in the pre-CPB samples. Further, exosomal miR-223 from plasma collected after CPB began downregulated IL-6 and NLRP3 expression in the monocytes. Here, we present the novel findings that increased plasma exosomal miR-223 expression during cardiac surgery with CPB might play homeostatic roles in downregulating inflammatory responses through intercellular communication.

The Role of Isolation Methods on a Nanoscale Surface Structure and its Effect on the Size of Exosomes.	J Circ Biomark	2016 Jan-Dec	Exosomes are ∼100 nanometre diameter vesicles secreted by mammalian cells. These emerging disease biomarkers carry nucleic acids, proteins and lipids specific to the parental cells that secrete them. Exosomes are typically isolated in bulk by ultracentrifugation, filtration or immunoaffinity precipitation for downstream proteomic, genomic, or lipidomic analysis. However, the structural properties and heterogeneity of isolated exosomes at the single vesicle level are not well characterized due to their small size. In this paper, by using high-resolution atomic force microscope imaging, we show the nanoscale morphology and structural heterogeneity in exosomes derived from U87 cells. Quantitative assessment of single exosomes reveals nanoscale variations in morphology, surface roughness and counts isolated by ultracentrifugation (UC) and immunoaffinity (IA) purification. Both methods produce intact globular, 30-120 nm sized vesicles when imaged under fluid and in air. However, IA exosomes had higher surface roughness and bimodal size population compared to UC exosomes. The study highlights the differences in size and surface topography of exosomes purified from a single cell type using different isolation methods.	PMC5548320

Polymer-based precipitation preserves biological activities of extracellular vesicles from an endometrial cell line.	PLoS One	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound vesicles released by cells and act as media for transfer of proteins, small RNAs and mRNAs to distant sites. They can be isolated by different methods. However, the biological activities of the purified EVs have seldom been studied. In this study, we compared the use of ultracentrifugation (UC), ultra-filtration (UF), polymer-based precipitation (PBP), and PBP with size-based purification (PBP+SP) for isolation of EVs from human endometrial cells and mouse uterine luminal fluid (ULF). Electron microscopy revealed that the diameters of the isolated EVs were similar among the tested methods. UF recovered the highest number of EVs followed by PBP, while UC and PBP+SP were significantly less efficient (P<0.05). Based on the number of EVs-to-protein ratios, PBP had the least protein contamination, significantly better than the other methods (P<0.05). All the isolated EVs expressed exosome-enriched proteins CD63, TSG101 and HSP70. Incubation of the trophoblast JEG-3 cells with an equal amount of the fluorescence-labelled EVs isolated by the studied methods showed that many of the PBP-EVs treated cells were fluorescence positive but only a few cells were labelled in the UC- and UF-EVs treated groups. Moreover, the PBP-EVs could transfer significantly more miRNA to the recipient cells than the other 3 methods (P<0.05). The PBP method could isolate EVs from mouse ULF; the diameter of the isolated EVs was 62±19 nm and expressed CD63, TSG101 and HSP70 proteins. In conclusion, PBP could best preserve the activities of the isolated EVs among the 4 methods studied and was able to isolate EVs from a small volume of sample. The simple setup and low equipment demands makes PBP the most suitable method for rapid EV assessment and isolation of EVs in clinical and basic research settings.	PMC5638560

J Neurooncol	2018	Malignant gliomas, the most frequent primary brain tumors, are characterized by a dismal prognosis. Reliable biomarkers complementary to neuroradiology in the differential diagnosis of gliomas and monitoring for post-surgical progression are unmet needs. Altered expression of several microRNAs in tumour tissues from patients with gliomas compared to normal brain tissue have been described, thus supporting the rationale of using microRNA-based biomarkers. Although different circulating microRNAs were proposed in association with gliomas, they have not been introduced into clinical practice so far. Blood samples were collected from patients with high and low grade gliomas, both before and after surgical resection, and the expression of miR-21, miR-222 and miR-124-3p was measured in exosomes isolated from serum. The expression levels of miR-21, miR-222 and miR-124-3p in serum exosomes of patients with high grade gliomas were significantly higher than those of low grade gliomas and healthy controls and were sharply decreased in samples obtained after surgery. The analysis of miR-21, miR-222 and miR-124-3p in serum exosomes of patients affected by gliomas can provide a minimally invasive and innovative tool to help the differential diagnosis of gliomas at their onset in the brain and predict glioma grading and non glial metastases before surgery.

Mol Cancer	2017	BACKGROUND: Our understanding of the multiple roles exosomes play during tumor progression is still very poor and the contribution of the normal tissue derived exosomes in distant seeding and tumor outgrowth has also not been widely appreciated. METHODS: Using our all-human liver microphysiological system (MPS) platform as a model to closely recapitulate the early metastatic events, we isolated exosomes from both tumor cells and liver microenvironment. RESULTS: We observed that while priming of the hepatic niche (HepN) with MDA-231 breast cancer derived exosomes facilitated seeding of the cancer cells in the liver, subsequent tumor outgrowth was diminished; this was consistent with increased entry into dormancy. We found that hepatic niche (HepN) derived exosomes contribute significantly to the exosome pool and are distinguished from cancer derived exosomes based on their size, protein and miRNA content. By Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the miRNA content of the HepN, MDA-231/HepN and MDA-231 cells we showed that the HepN derived exosomes affect the breast cancer cells by suppressing pathways involved in cancer cell proliferation and invasion. More importantly exposure of MDA-231 and MDA-468 cells to purified normal HepN derived exosomes, induced changes in the cells consistent with a Mesenchymal to Epithelial reverting Transition (MErT). miRNA arrays performed on MDA-231 treated with Hum Hep/NPC derived exosomes showed significant changes in the levels of a select number of miRNAs involved in epithelial cell differentiation and miRNAs, such as miR186, miR23a and miR205, from our top and bottom bins have previously been reported to regulate E-cadherin transcription and MErT induction in various cancer types. Consistently HepN derived exosome treatment of breast and prostate cancer lines lead to a transient induction of E-cadherin and ZO-1 at the protein level and a more epithelial-like morphology of the cells. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively our data revealed a novel mechanism of regulation of the metastatic cascade, showing a well-orchestrated, timely controlled crosstalk between the cancer cells and the HepN and implicating for the first time the normal tissue/HepN derived exosomes in enabling seeding and entry into dormancy of the cancer cells at the metastatic site.

Alteration of exosomes secreted from renal tubular epithelial cells exposed to high-concentration oxalate.	Oncotarget	2017	Oxalate (Ox) is a metabolic end product that is produced by the kidneys and is associated with several pathological conditions. The accumulation of oxalate in the body is one of the factors that lead to calcium oxalate kidney stones. To simulate the high-concentration Ox environment in vivo, we established an in vitro model of high Ox using renal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells. Cell viability and proliferation were assessed to evaluate the effects of various concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10Mm) of Ox on HK-2 cells to select the optimum concentration and time to extract the exosomes. Treatment with 0, 1, or 2 mM Ox altered the morphology and secretion capacity of exosomes. As the concentration of Ox increased, peak and mean particle size decreased, but exosomes particle concentration, exosome RNA, and exosome protein increased. Size, distribution, and rate of secretion, as well as RNA and protein content, differed among extracellular vesicle subtypes. Furthermore, the three subtypes of exosomes delivered different signal factors in the microenvironment. We therefore speculated that three subtypes of exosomes may play differing roles in intercellular signal communication and the formation of CaOx kidney stones.	PMC5696210

The clinical significance of circulating GPC1 positive exosomes and its regulative miRNAs in colon cancer patients.	Oncotarget	2017	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Recent study found an increased level of glypican-1 positive (GPC1+) plasma exosomes in patients with stage II CRC, but decreased levels of plasma miR-96-5p and miR-149. This study further investigated the clinical significance of plasma GPC1+ exosomes and plasma miR-96-5p and miR-149 levels in stage III CRC patients. To study the effect of these microRNAs on GPC1+ plasma exosomes, we isolated and purified exosomes and overexpressed human GPC1 and the microRNAs miR-96-5p and miR-149 by adenovirus vectors. Overexpression of GPC1 activated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which then increased invasion and migration in HT29 and HCT-116 colon cancer cells. In contrast, silencing GPC1 expression and overexpressing miR-96-5p and miR-149 significantly inactivated EMT and decreased invasion and migration of HT29 and HCT-116 cells. miR-96-5p and miR-149 inhibitors significantly increased invasion and migration of HT29 and HCT-116 cells. Our results indicate that high levels of circulating GPC1 positive exosomes before and after surgery as well as low circulating miR-96-5p and miR-149 before surgery indicated a severe clinical status and poor prognosis in stage III colon cancer patients. We conclude that GPC1 can be a biomarker for relapse of stage III CRC and may be involved in EMT activation, invasion, and migration of colorectal cancer cells.	PMC5731866

Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets	2017	OBJECTIVE: Exosomes are small secreted membrane vesicles formed in the late endocytic compartments by inward budding. Interest in these extracellular vesicles and their role in atherosclerosis is growing, as they can affect multiple cellular processes that lead to lipid overload, cytokine secretion and cellular adhesion. Exosomes protect and transport lipids, proteins, and RNAs, fostering intercellular communication among different cell types involved in atherogenesis such as macrophages, endothelium and smooth muscle. Their molecular composition reflects their cell type of origin, but they share attributes because they are enriched in proteins of their endosomal source. CONCLUSION: This review will describe the current state of our knowledge of exosome involvement in the development of atherosclerosis. The transfer of signaling molecules, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs via exosomes with effects on monocyte and macrophage cholesterol metabolism, endothelial cell and platelet activation and smooth muscle proliferation will be discussed. Finally, therapeutic potential of exosomes and clinical application will be explored.

Cyclooxygenase-2 expression is induced by celecoxib treatment in lung cancer cells and is transferred to neighbor cells via exosomes.	Int J Oncol	2018	Lung cancer is one of most common types of cancer worldwide. Lung cancer results in a death higher rate each year compared to colon, breast and prostate cancer combined. Celecoxib is a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX‑2), an enzyme of which the expression is induced by various stimuli, such as inflammation. In addition, celecoxib triggers COX-2 loading on exosomes. Exosomes are small vesicles composed of a lipid bilayer membrane and are found in most biological fluids, such as blood breast milk and urine. In this study, we focused on exosomes containing COX-2 proteins from lung cancer cells to determine their involvement in the interaction with neighbor cells following treatment with celecoxib. We found that celecoxib induced COX-2 expression in both the cytosol and exosomes in lung cancer cells. Exosomes from celecoxib-treated lung cancer cell culture supernatant were isolated and incubated with several types of cells. The THP-1, monocytic leukemia cell line effectively absorbed COX-2 by lung cancer cell-derived exosomes. Following incubation with exosomes, the COX-2 protein level was increased in the THP-1 cells; however, COX-2 mRNA expression was not affected. Moreover, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by THP-1 cells was increased following incubation with exosomes from celecoxib-treated lung cancer cells. Conditioned medium from THP-1 following incubation with exosomes promoted formation in EA.hy926 cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that celecoxib induces COX-2 expression in lung cancer cells, and that highly expressed COX-2 in exosomes can be transferred to other cells.

Electronic address: .	wangbo6292@126.com		Exosome-associated tau exacerbates brain functional impairments induced by traumatic brain injury in mice.	Mol Cell Neurosci	2018	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been associated with an increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases, and Tau spread and accumulation might be one of the mechanisms underlying this process. Exosomes were speculated to be a vehicle for spreading Tau in neurodegenerative diseases. The present study sought to investigate the effect of exosome associated Tau after TBI. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to controlled cortical impact injury and the levels of total and phosphorylated Tau in exosomes were measured. Then we isolated exosomes from wildtype and Tau-knockout mice after TBI. These exosomes were either added to primary cultured neurons to evaluate the toxicity, or injected into brains of mice subjected to TBI to evaluate the effect on brain functions. The levels of total and phosphorylated Tau in exosomes after TBI were significantly elevated. TBI derived exosomes displayed toxicity in primary neuron cultures, exacerbated TBI induced LTP (long-term potentiation) impairment and exacerbated motor and cognitive impairments after TBI. The exosome-associated Tau pathology was one of the mechanisms underlying the long-term neurodegenerative effect after TBI.

Diabetologia	2018	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Improved biomarkers are acutely needed for the detection of developing type 1 diabetes, prior to critical loss of beta cell mass. We previously demonstrated that elevated beta cell microRNA 21-5p (miR-21-5p) in rodent and human models of type 1 diabetes increased beta cell apoptosis. We hypothesised that the inflammatory milieu of developing diabetes may also increase miR-21-5p in beta cell extracellular vesicle (EV) cargo and that circulating EV miR-21-5p would be increased during type 1 diabetes development. METHODS: MIN6 and EndoC-βH1 beta cell lines and human islets were treated with IL-1β, IFN-γ and TNF-α to mimic the inflammatory milieu of early type 1 diabetes. Serum was collected weekly from 8-week-old female NOD mice until diabetes onset. Sera from a cross-section of 19 children at the time of type 1 diabetes diagnosis and 16 healthy children were also analysed. EVs were isolated from cell culture media or serum using sequential ultracentrifugation or ExoQuick precipitation and EV miRNAs were assayed. RESULTS: Cytokine treatment in beta cell lines and human islets resulted in a 1.5- to threefold increase in miR-21-5p. However, corresponding EVs were further enriched for this miRNA, with a three- to sixfold EV miR-21-5p increase in response to cytokine treatment. This difference was only partially reduced by pre-treatment of beta cells with Z-VAD-FMK to inhibit cytokine-induced caspase activity. Nanoparticle tracking analysis showed cytokines to have no effect on the number of EVs, implicating specific changes within EV cargo as being responsible for the increase in beta cell EV miR-21-5p. Sequential ultracentrifugation to separate EVs by size suggested that this effect was mostly due to cytokine-induced increases in exosome miR-21-5p. Longitudinal serum collections from NOD mice showed that EVs displayed progressive increases in miR-21-5p beginning 3 weeks prior to diabetes onset. To validate the relevance to human diabetes, we assayed serum from children with new-onset type 1 diabetes compared with healthy children. While total serum miR-21-5p and total serum EVs were reduced in diabetic participants, serum EV miR-21-5p was increased threefold compared with non-diabetic individuals. By contrast, both serum and EV miR-375-5p were increased in parallel among diabetic participants. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We propose that circulating EV miR-21-5p may be a promising marker of developing type 1 diabetes. Additionally, our findings highlight that, for certain miRNAs, total circulating miRNA levels are distinct from circulating EV miRNA content.	PMC5878132

Electronic address: .	prashanth.vallabhajosyula@uphs.upenn.edu		Donor tissue-specific exosome profiling enables noninvasive monitoring of acute rejection in mouse allogeneic heart transplantation.	J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg	2018	OBJECTIVE: In heart transplantation, there is a critical need for development of biomarkers to noninvasively monitor cardiac allografts for immunologic rejection or injury. Exosomes are tissue-specific nanovesicles released into circulation by many cell types. Their profiles are dynamic, reflecting conditional changes imposed on their tissue counterparts. We proposed that a transplanted heart releases donor-specific exosomes into the recipient's circulation that are conditionally altered during immunologic rejection. We investigated this novel concept in a rodent heterotopic heart transplantation model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Full major histocompatibility mismatch (BALB/c [H2-Kd] into C57BL/6 [H2-Kb]) heterotopic heart transplantation was performed in 2 study arms: Rejection (n = 64) and Maintenance (n = 28). In the Rejection arm, immunocompetent recipients fully rejected the donor heart, whereas in the Maintenance arm, immunodeficient recipients (C57BL/6 PrkdcSCID) accepted the allograft. Recipient plasma exosomes were isolated and a donor heart-specific exosome signal was characterized on the nanoparticle detector for time-specific profile changes using anti-H2-Kd antibody quantum dot. RESULTS: In the Maintenance arm, allografts were viable throughout follow-up of 30 days, with histology confirming absence of rejection or injury. Time course analysis (days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, and 30) showed that total plasma exosome concentration (P = .157) and donor heart exosome signal (P = .538) was similar between time points. In the Rejection arm, allografts were universally rejected (median, day 11). Total plasma exosome quantity and size distribution were similar between follow-up time points (P = .278). Donor heart exosome signals peaked on day 1, but significantly decreased by day 2 (P = 2 × 10-4) and day 3 (P = 3.3 × 10-6), when histology showed grade 0R rejection. The receiver operating characteristic curve for a binary separation of the 2 study arms (Maintenance vs Rejection) demonstrated that a donor heart exosome signal threshold < 0.3146 was 91.4% sensitive and 95.8% specific for diagnosis of early acute rejection. CONCLUSIONS: Transplant heart exosome profiling enables noninvasive monitoring of early acute rejection with high accuracy. Translation of this concept to clinical settings might enable development of a novel biomarker platform for allograft monitoring in transplantation diagnostics.

Exosomes derived from Toxoplasma gondii stimulate an inflammatory response through JNK signaling pathway.	Nanomedicine (Lond)	2018	AIM: Exosomes are nanoscale membranous vesicles secreted by most cell types able to transfer bioactive molecules among cells, which play crucial roles in intercellular communication. We characterized the exosomes derived from Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) and detected the immune response in macrophages. METHODS: We used transmission electron microscopy, nanotracking analysis and western blotting to identify T. gondii exosomes. Functional experiments were performed in RAW264.7 cells for the induction of cytokines, MAPKs (p38 MAPK, ERK 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase [JNK]), mRNAs and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated JNK protein. RESULTS: JNK pathway was activated by T. gondii exosomes, and the production of IL-12, IFN-γ and TNF-α was significantly increased in macrophages. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that T. gondii exosomes elicit innate immune through JNK activation, which could provide new insight into the essential regulators of host-pathogen interactions.	
29590649	Jia Sun				Circulating LncRNAs Analysis in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Reveals Novel Genes Influencing Glucose Metabolism and Islet β-Cell Function.	Cell Physiol Biochem	2018	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The islet is an important endocrine organ to secrete insulin to regulate the metabolism of glucose and maintain the stability of blood glucose. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in a variety of biological functions and play key roles in many diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aim of this study was to determine whether lncRNA-p3134 is associated with glucose metabolism and insulin signaling in pancreatic β cells. METHODS: LncRNA microarray technology was used to identify the differentially expressed circulating lncRNAs in T2D patients. RT-PCR analyses were performed to determine the expression of lncRNA-p3134 in 30 pairs of diabetic and non-diabetic patients. The correlation of lncRNA-p3134 to clinical data from T2D patients was analyzed. LncRNA-p3134 was overexpressed in Min6 cells and db/db mice by adenovirus-mediated technology. CCK-8, TUNEL, Western blot, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), ELISAs and immunochemistry were performed to determine the effect of lncRNA-p3134 on proliferation, apoptosis and insulin secretion both in vitro and vivo. RESULTS: The circulating level of lncRNA-p3134 was higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic controls and was correlated with fasting blood glucose and HOMA-β levels. The lncRNA-p3134 had risen by 4 times in serum exosomes but nearly unchanged in exosome-free samples. The secretion of lncRNA-p3134 was dynamically modulated by glucose in both Min6 cells and isolated mouse islet cells. LncRNA-p3134 positively regulate GSIS through promoting of key regulators (Pdx-1, MafA, GLUT2 and Tcf7l2) in β cells. In addition, the overexpression of lncRNA-p3134 resulted in a decreased apoptosis ratio and partially reversed the glucotoxicity effects on GSIS function in Min6 cells. The restoration of insulin synthesis and secretion the increase of the insulin positive cells areas by upregulation of lncRNA-p3134 in db/db mice confirmed the compensatory role of lncRNA-p3134 to preserve β-cell function. Furthermore, a protective effect of lncRNA-p3134 on GSIS by positive modulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling was also confirmed. After blocking the PI3K/AKT signals with their specific inhibitor, the effect of overexpressed lncRNA-p3134 on insulin secretion was obviously attenuated. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results of this study provide new insights into lncRNA-p3134 regulation in pancreatic β cells and provide a better understanding of novel mechanism of glucose homeostasis.

Exosomal MicroRNAs in Milk from Mothers Delivering Preterm Infants Survive in Vitro Digestion and Are Taken up by Human Intestinal Cells.	Mol Nutr Food Res	2018	SCOPE: This study investigates the ability of preterm milk exosomes to survive gastric/pancreatic digestion, internalization by intestinal epithelia, and the microRNAs (miRNAs) contents. METHODS AND RESULTS: At average infant age 1 week and 6 days, milk is collected from mothers who delivered preterm and term infants (n = 10). Milk is exposed to conditions simulating infant gut digestion. Exosomes are isolated and lysed, and the exposed miRNAs are sequenced. Preterm milk exosomes survive in vitro digestion, and can be taken up by intestinal epithelia. Three hundred and thirty miRNAs are identified as preterm milk exosome miRNAs, and in vitro digestion does not have a pronounced effect on their expression. The abundant miRNAs in preterm milk exosomes are similar to those from term milk. Twenty-one low abundance miRNAs are specifically expressed in preterm milk exosomes compared to early term milk in the current study and what previously is found in mature term milk. CONCLUSION: These results for the first time reveal the survivability of preterm milk exosomes following simulated gastric/pancreatic digestion. The authors demonstrate the richness of the miRNAs content in these exosomes. The results improve the knowledge of preterm milk biology and the molecular basis by which exosome miRNAs may uniquely affect preterm infants during early development.

Blood	2018	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes various diseases in the elderly including B-cell lymphoma such as Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here, we show that EBV acts in trans on non-infected macrophages in the tumor through exosome secretion and augments the development of lymphomas. In a humanized mouse model, the different formation of lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) between two EBV strains (Akata and B95-8) was evident. Furthermore, injection of Akata derived exosomes affected LPD severity possibly through the regulation of macrophage phenotype in vivo. Exosomes collected from Akata- lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) reportedly contain EBV-derived non-coding RNAs such as BamHI fragment A rightward transcript (BART) miRNAs and EBV-encoded RNA (EBER). We focused on the exosome-mediated delivery of BART miRNAs. In vitro, BART miRNAs could induce the immune regulatory phenotype in macrophages characterized by the gene expressions of interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and arginase 1, suggesting the immune regulatory role of BART miRNAs. The expression level of an EBV-encoded miRNA was strongly linked to the clinical outcomes in elderly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients. These results implicate BART miRNAs as one of the factors regulating the severity of lymphoproliferative disease and as a diagnostic marker for EBV+ B-cell lymphoma.

Exosomal Cargo Properties, Endothelial Function and Treatment of Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome: A Proof of Concept Study.	J Clin Sleep Med	2018	STUDY OBJECTIVES: Longitudinal studies support the usage of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy in treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to improve cardiovascular disease. However, the anticipated benefit is not ubiquitous. In this study, we elucidate whether PAP therapy leads to immediate improvements on endothelial function, a subclinical marker of cardiovascular status, by examining the effect of circulating exosomes, isolated from patients before and after PAP therapy, on naive endothelial cells. METHODS: We isolated plasma-derived circulating exosomes from 12 patients with severe OSA and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) before and after 6 weeks of PAP therapy, and examined their effect on cultured endothelial cells using several in vitro reporter assays. RESULTS: We found that circulating exosomes contributed to the induction and propagation of OSA/OHS-related endothelial dysfunction (ie, increased permeability and disruption of tight junctions along with increased adhesion molecule expression, and reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression), and promoted increased monocyte adherence. Further, when comparing exosomes isolated before and after PAP therapy, the disturbances in endothelial cell function were attenuated with treatment, including an overall cumulative decrease in endothelial permeability in all 12 subjects by 10.8% (P = .035), as well as detection of a subset of 4 differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs, even in the absence of parallel changes in systemic blood pressure or metabolic function. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating exosomes facilitate important intercellular signals that modify endothelial phenotype, and thus emerge as potential fundamental contributors in the context of OSA/OHS-related endothelial dysfunction. Exosomes may not only provide candidate biomarkers, but are also a likely and plausible mechanism toward OSA/OHS-induced cardiovascular disease.

Exp Cell Res	2018	The subtypes of distant-organ metastasis led to treatment failure and poor prognosis are major obstacles in the management of patients with advanced breast cancer (BCa). Emerging evidences demonstrated that exosomes act as mediators for intercellular communication between various types of cells in the local tumor microenvironment. The present study aims to investigate whether BCa-derived exosomes are capable of cell-cell transferring miR-222 for BCa metastatic progression. Results showed that exosomal miR-222 is highly expressed in BCa patients with lymphatic metastasis. Consistently, the elevated levels of exosomal miR-222 are closely correlated with the high aggressivity of BCa cell lines. miR-222 promoting the aggressivity of BCa cells was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-222 directly targets PDLIM2, a tumor suppressor gene, leading to activation of NF-κB signal pathway. In conclusion, the levels of exosomal miR-222 are correlated with BCa metastatic progression. Exosome-transferred miR-222 promotes migration and invasion of BCa cells. miR-222 contributes to tumorigenicity of BCa cells through down-regulation of PDLIM2 and consequently activating NF-κB.

Exosomes as potent cell-free peptide-based vaccine. I. Dendritic cell-derived exosomes transfer functional MHC class I/peptide complexes to dendritic cells.	J Immunol	2004	Current immunization protocols in cancer patients involve CTL-defined tumor peptides. Mature dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent APCs for the priming of naive CD8(+) T cells, eventually leading to tumor eradication. Because DC can secrete MHC class I-bearing exosomes, we addressed whether exosomes pulsed with synthetic peptides could subserve the DC function consisting in MHC class I-restricted, peptide-specific CTL priming in vitro and in vivo. The priming of CTL restricted by HLA-A2 molecules and specific for melanoma peptides was performed: 1) using in vitro stimulations of total blood lymphocytes with autologous DC pulsed with GMP-manufactured autologous exosomes in a series of normal volunteers; 2) in HLA-A2 transgenic mice (HHD2) using exosomes harboring functional HLA-A2/Mart1 peptide complexes. In this study, we show that: 1). DC release abundant MHC class I/peptide complexes transferred within exosomes to other naive DC for efficient CD8(+) T cell priming in vitro; 2). exosomes require nature's adjuvants (mature DC) to efficiently promote the differentiation of melanoma-specific effector T lymphocytes producing IFN-gamma (Tc1) effector lymphocytes in HLA-A2 transgenic mice (HHD2). These data imply that exosomes might be a transfer mechanism of functional MHC class I/peptide complexes to DC for efficient CTL activation in vivo.

Alternative mechanism by which IFN-gamma enhances tumor recognition: active release of heat shock protein 72.	J Immunol	2005	IFN-gamma exhibits differential effects depending on the target and can induce cellular activation and enhance survival or mediate cell death via activation of apoptotic pathways. In this study, we demonstrate an alternative mechanism by which IFN-gamma enhances tumor recognition, mediated by the active release of Hsp72. We demonstrate that stimulation of 4T1 breast adenocarcinoma cells and K562 erythroleukemic cells with IFN-gamma triggers the cellular stress response, which results in the enhanced expression of total Hsp72 expression without a significant increase in cell death. Intracellular expression of Hsp72 was abrogated in cells stably transfected with a mutant hsf-1 gene. IFN-gamma-induced Hsp72 expression correlated with enhanced surface expression and consequent release of Hsp72 into the culture medium. Pretreatment of tumors with compounds known to the block the classical protein transport pathway, including monensin, brefeldin A, tunicamycin, and thapsigargin, did not significantly block Hsp72 release. However, pretreatment with intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM or disruption of lipid rafts using methyl beta-cyclodextrin completely abrogated IFN-gamma-induced Hsp72 release. Biochemical characterization revealed that Hsp72 is released within exosomes and has the ability to up-regulate CD83 expression and stimulate IL-12 release by naive dendritic cells. Pretreatment with neutralizing mAb or depletion of Hsp72 completely abrogated its chaperokine function. Taken together, these findings are indicative of an additional previously unknown mechanism by which IFN-gamma promotes tumor surveillance and furthers our understanding of the central role of extracellular Hsp72 as an endogenous adjuvant and danger signal.

The potential of retroviral vectors to cotransfer human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) from human packaging cell lines.	Gene	2007	Using a versatile and highly sensitive retroviral microarray, we have investigated particle preparations from three different human packaging cell lines harboring retroviral vector systems based on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and murine leukemia virus (MLV). 293Rev/Gag/Pol(i) cells inducibly express high titers of HIV-derived particles for packaging of HIV vectors. The Phoenix-GP and the Anjou 65 cell lines constitutively express MLV vector particles. We compared the transcription profiles of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) in all cell lines with the HERV sequences present in the particles. In addition, the influence of the transfected vector plasmid on the copackaging of HERVs was investigated. All particle preparations showed a defined pattern of endogenous retroviral sequences that differed from the cellular HERV expression pattern. HERV transcripts were observed in the particle preparations independent of whether a vector construct was coexpressed or not. Furthermore, our results suggest that particle preparations are frequently contaminated by cellular vesicles (exosomes) containing cellular RNAs including HERV transcripts.

Kidney Int	2007	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles that are secreted from a variety of cell types into various body fluids including the blood and urine. These vesicles are thought to play a role in cell-cell interactions. CD24 is a small but extensively glycosylated protein linked to the cell surface by means of a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. In this study we found that CD24 is present in membrane vesicles characterized as exosomes that were isolated from the urine of normal individuals. CD24 was expressed by both tubule cells and podocytes and treatment of the latter with a cholesterol-extracting agent, but not with a calcium ionophore, caused the release of CD24-containing exosomes. Using CD24 as a marker, we found exosomes in the urine of newborn infants and in the amniotic fluid of pregnant women with similar findings made in mice. Interestingly, studies with CD24 knockout mice showed that the exosomes are released from the fetus but not from the mother; however, exosome release was similar from both the knockout and the wild-type mice. This indicates that CD24 is not essential for exosome formation or release but may be a convenient exosome marker. Our studies suggest that exosomal secretion from the embryonic kidney could play a biological role at the fetal-maternal interphase.

The mRNA decay promoting factor K-homology splicing regulator protein post-transcriptionally determines parathyroid hormone mRNA levels.	FASEB J	2008	Serum calcium and phosphate concentrations and experimental chronic kidney failure control parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene expression post-transcriptionally through regulated binding of the trans-acting proteins AUF1 and upstream of N-ras (Unr) to an AU-rich element (ARE) in PTH mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). We show that the mRNA decay promoting K-homology splicing regulator protein (KSRP) binds to PTH mRNA in intact parathyroid glands and in transfected cells. This binding is decreased in glands from calcium-depleted or experimental chronic kidney failure rats in which PTH mRNA is more stable compared to parathyroid glands from control and phosphorus-depleted rats in which PTH mRNA is less stable. PTH mRNA decay depends on the KSRP-recruited exosome in parathyroid extracts. In transfected cells, KSRP overexpression and knockdown experiments show that KSRP decreases PTH mRNA stability and steady-state levels through the PTH mRNA ARE. Overexpression of isoform p45 of the PTH mRNA stabilizing protein AUF1 blocks KSRP-PTH mRNA binding and partially prevents the KSRP mediated decrease in PTH mRNA levels. Therefore, calcium or phosphorus depletion, as well as chronic kidney failure, regulate the interaction of KSRP and AUF1 with PTH mRNA and its half-life. Our data indicate a novel role for KSRP in PTH gene expression.

Vaccine	2009	Toxoplasmosis is a serious disease in humans and may cause abortion or congenital infection if a woman is exposed to the disease for the first time during pregnancy. Infection before pregnancy normally results in immunity protecting the foetus, suggesting that it may be possible to block vertical transmission of the parasite by appropriate vaccination before pregnancy. We found that the vaccination of CBA/J mice, before pregnancy, with exosomes secreted by SRDCs pulsed in vitro with Toxoplasma gondii-derived antigens (TAg) induced a protective response in the pups. Indeed, vaccination resulted in the presence of significantly fewer cysts in pup brains. This protection was associated with strong humoral responses in the serum in vivo. We also observed cellular responses in vivo, with cell proliferation associated with the production of cytokines by the splenocytes. Thus, exosomes are nucleic acid-free vesicles able to induce immune responses correlated with protection against T. gondii infection in a congenital model. They are therefore a potentially useful tool for vaccination against infectious disease.

Immature myeloid cells induced by a high-fat diet contribute to liver inflammation.	Hepatology	2009	Chronic inflammation plays a critical role in promoting obesity-related disorders, such as fatty liver disease. The inflammatory cells that mediate these effects remain unknown. This study investigated the accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the liver and their role in liver inflammation. We found that the accumulation of immature myeloid cells, i.e., CD11b(+)Ly6C(hi)Ly6G(-) cells, in the liver of B6 mice fed a high-fat diet contribute to liver inflammation. Adoptive transfer of CD11b(+)Ly6C(hi)Ly6G(-) cells isolated from the liver of obese B6 mice, but not from lean B6 mice, resulted in liver damage that was evident by an increase in the activity of liver transferases in serum. CD11b(+)Ly6C(hi)Ly6G(-) cells isolated from the liver of obese mice are more easily activated by way of Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation resulting in interleukin 12 and other inflammatory cytokine expression in an MyD88-dependent fashion. TLR7-activated CD11b(+)Ly6C(hi)Ly6G(-) cells also enhance liver natural killer T cell (NKT) death in an Fas-dependent manner. Experiments using mice depleted of Gr-1(+) immature myeloid cells demonstrated the important role of CD11b(+)Ly6C(hi)Ly6G(-) in liver inflammation. Repeated injection of exosome-like particles causes CD11b(+) cell activation and subsequent homing to and accumulation of the cells in the liver. CONCLUSION: Consumption of a high-fat diet by B6 mice triggers an accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the liver. The immature myeloid cells release proinflammatory cytokines and induce NKT cell apoptosis. Activation-induced NKT apoptosis further promotes excessive production of Th-1 cytokines. This diet-induced accumulation of immature myeloid cells may contribute to obesity-related liver disease.	PMC2852608

Cellular prion protein released on exosomes from macrophages binds to Hsp70.	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	2010	Prion diseases are infectious and fatal neurodegenerative disorders. The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) converting into misfolded isoform of prion protein (PrP(Sc)) is responsible for prion disease infection. Immune system plays an important role in facilitating the spread of prion infections from the periphery to the central nervous system. Macrophages were considered associated with the transportation and replication of PrP(Sc). So, understanding the PrP(C) trafficking in macrophages is important to explore the transport mechanism for PrP(Sc). Here, we isolated exosomes from the culture medium of Ana-1 macrophage cell line and investigated the PrP(C) trafficked by exosomes and the interaction of PrP(C) with Hsp70 in secreted exosomes by western blotting, immunoelectron microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation. The results showed that the isolated vesicles from the culture medium of macrophages were characterized by exosomes and bore PrP(C). And PrP(C) bound to Hsp70 both in intracellular environment and secreted exosomes. In contrast, PrP(C) had no interaction with marker proteins of exosomes, Tag101 and Flotillin-1. These results suggested that PrP(C) present in extracellular space might be externalized through secreted exosomes from macrophages, and Hsp70 may play roles in the process of PrP(C) released via secreted exosomes.

Yeast lsm pro-apoptotic mutants show defects in S-phase entry and progression.	Cell Cycle	2010	Expression of the histone genes is tightly coupled to rates of DNA synthesis in yeast and histone mRNAs are modulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Trf4 and Trf5, poly(A) polymerases, that mediates polyadenylation and consequent degradation) and Rrp6, an exosome component, play a role in the regulation of histone mRNA levels. In this paper we show that in the mRNA degradation mutant Kllsm4Δ1, histone mRNAs are induced early in the S-phase and maintained at high level all along the entire cell cycle due to a delay in the exit from S-phase and/or entry into M-phase. The overexpression of the HIR1 gene (Histone transcriptional repressor), previously isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the apoptotic phenotypes observed in Kllsm4Δ1, can also restore the normal cycling of histone genes expression. We also found that low doses of hydroxyurea neutralize the onset of the apoptotic phenotypes in Kllsm4Δ1, as well in another mRNA decapping mutants (lsm1) and, in addition, increase the chronological lifespan in both strains suggesting that an entry delay into the S phase can recover some cellular defects in decapping mutants.

Morphologic and proteomic characterization of exosomes released by cultured extravillous trophoblast cells.	Exp Cell Res	2011	Exosomes represent an important intercellular communication vehicle, mediating events essential for the decidual microenvironment. While we have demonstrated exosome induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, to date, no extensive characterization of trophoblast-derived exosomes has been provided. Our objective was to provide a morphologic and proteomic characterization of these exosomes. Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned media of Swan71 human trophoblast cells by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation. These were analyzed for density (sucrose density gradient centrifugation), morphology (electron microscopy), size (dynamic light scattering) and protein composition (Ion Trap mass spectrometry and western immunoblotting). Based on density gradient centrifugation, microvesicles from Sw71 cells exhibit a density between 1.134 and 1.173g/ml. Electron microscopy demonstrated that microvesicles from Sw71 cells exhibit the characteristic cup-shaped morphology of exosomes. Dynamic light scattering showed a bell-shaped curve, indicating a homogeneous population with a mean size of 165nm ± 0.5nm. Ion Trap mass spectrometry demonstrated the presence of exosome marker proteins (including CD81, Alix, cytoskeleton related proteins, and Rab family). The MS results were confirmed by western immunoblotting. Based on morphology, density, size and protein composition, we defined the release of exosomes from extravillous trophoblast cells and provide their first extensive characterization. This characterization is essential in furthering our understanding of "normal" early pregnancy.

Increased microRNA-1 and microRNA-133a levels in serum of patients with cardiovascular disease indicate myocardial damage.	Circ Cardiovasc Genet	2011	BACKGROUND: Recently, elevation of circulating muscle-specific microRNA (miRNA) levels has been reported in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, it is still unclear from which part of the myocardium or under what conditions miRNAs are released into circulating blood. The purpose of this study was to identify the source of elevated levels of circulating miRNAs and their function in cardiovascular diseases. METHODS AND RESULTS: Serum levels of miRNA (miR)-1 and miR-133a were increased significantly in patients not only with acute myocardial infarction but also with unstable angina pectoris and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy without elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase or cardiac troponin. MicroRNA microarray analysis of the heart from a mouse model of myocardial infarction indicated that the levels of miR-1, miR-133a, miR-208a, and miR-499 were significantly reduced in the infarcted myocardium. In situ hybridization of miR-133a also showed that miR-133a levels were very low in the infarcted and peri-infarcted myocardium. It has been shown that circulating miRNAs are localized inside exosomes, which are released after Ca(2+) stimulation. We stimulated H9c2 cardiomyoblasts with A23187 and measured miR-133a levels in the exosome fraction of the culture medium. A23187 induced a dose-dependent release of miR-133a, and significant elevation was observed only at concentrations where dead cells were detected. We also found that miR-133a-containing exosomes reduced the luciferase activity of 293FT cells transfected with an miR-133a sensor vector. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that elevated levels of circulating miR-133a in patients with cardiovascular diseases originate mainly from the injured myocardium. Circulating miR-133a can be used as a marker for cardiomyocyte death, and it may have functions in cardiovascular diseases.

Tumor-derived exosomes as mediators of disease and potential diagnostic biomarkers.	Cancer Biomark	2010-2011	Tumor cells release membranous structures, defined as microvesicles or exosomes, consisting of an array of macromolecules derived from the originating cells, including proteins, lipids, and RNA. The expression of antigenic molecules recognizable by T cells originally suggested a role for these vesicles as a cell-free antigen source for anti-cancer vaccines; however, evidence demonstrates that tumor exosomes can exert a broad array of detrimental effects on the immune system - ranging from apoptosis of activated cytotoxic T cells to impairment of monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells, to induction of myeloid-suppressive cells. Immunosuppressive exosomes of tumor origin can be found in neoplastic lesions and biologic fluids from cancer patients, implying a potential role of these pathways in in vivo tumor progression and systemic paraneoplastic syndromes. Through the expression of molecules involved in angiogenesis promotion, stromal remodeling, signaling pathway activation through growth factor/receptor transfer, chemoresistance, and intercellular genetic exchange, tumor exosomes could represent a central mediator of the tumor microenvironment. Their release by tumor cells may represent the future for targeting therapeutic interventions and for development of multiplexed diagnostic biomarkers.

Secretion of αB-Crystallin via exosomes: New clues to the function of human retinal pigment epithelium.	Commun Integr Biol	2011	αB-crystallin (αB) is an archetypical small heat shock protein whose physiological function is not clearly defined. The interest in this protein arises from its well-established but poorly understood association with a myriad of neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and cardiomyopathies. The discovery of the secretion of αB from human adult retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE19) via exosomes not only points to the involvement of this protein in lateral transfer of information between cells in the visual system but also to the status of this protein as a potential ligand that may activate or modulate immune and stress responses, normal growth and oncogenic pathways. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a single layer of polarized cells that supports photoreceptor physiology and function. We have initiated investigations on understanding the origin of the elevated levels of αB in extracellular sub-retinal proteolipid deposits (known as "drusen") associated with the death of photoreceptor neurons in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Here we discuss the potential implications of the presence and transport of αB in exosomes across cell membranes in RPE.	PMC3306346

Transfer of vesicles from schwann cells to axons: a novel mechanism of communication in the peripheral nervous system.	Front Physiol	2012	Schwann cells (SCs) are the glial component of the peripheral nervous system, with essential roles during development and maintenance of axons, as well as during regenerative processes after nerve injury. SCs increase conduction velocities by myelinating axons, regulate synaptic activity at presynaptic nerve terminals and are a source of trophic factors to neurons. Thus, development and maintenance of peripheral nerves are crucially dependent on local signaling between SCs and axons. In addition to the classic mechanisms of intercellular signaling, the possibility of communication through secreted vesicles has been poorly explored to date. Interesting recent findings suggest the occurrence of lateral transfer mediated by vesicles from glial cells to axons that could have important roles in axonal growth and axonal regeneration. Here, we review the role of vesicular transfer from SCs to axons and propose the advantages of this means in supporting neuronal and axonal maintenance and regeneration after nerve damage.	PMC3374349

Mesenchymal stem cell secreted vesicles provide novel opportunities in (stem) cell-free therapy.	Front Physiol	2012	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult multipotent cells that give rise to various cell types of the mesodermal germ layer. MSCs are of great interest in the field of regenerative medicine and cancer therapy because of their unique ability to home to damaged and cancerous tissue. These cells also regulate the immune response and contribute to reparative processes in different pathological conditions, including musculoskeletal and cardiovascular diseases. The use of MSCs for tissue repair was initially based on the hypothesis that these cells home to and differentiate within the injured tissue into specialized cells. However, it now appears that only a small proportion of transplanted MSCs actually integrate and survive in host tissues. Thus, the predominant mechanism by which MSCs participate in tissue repair seems to be related to their paracrine activity. Indeed, MSCs provide the microenvironment with a multitude of trophic and survival signals including growth factors and cytokines. Recent discoveries suggest that lipid microvesicles released by MSCs may also be important in the physiological function of these cells. Over the past few years the biological relevance of micro- and nano-vesicles released by cells in intercellular communication has been established. Alongside the conventional mediators of cell secretome, these sophisticated nanovesicles transfer proteins, lipids and, most importantly, various forms of RNAs to neighboring cells, thereby mediating a variety of biological responses. The physiological role of MSC-derived vesicles (MSC-MVs) is currently not well understood. Nevertheless, encouraging results indicate that MSC-MVs have similar protective and reparative properties as their cellular counterparts in tissue repair and possibly anti-cancer therapy. Thus, MSC-MVs represent a promising opportunity to develop novel cell-free therapy approaches that might overcome the obstacles and risks associated with the use of native or engineered stem cells.

Identification of a novel motif that affects the conformation and activity of the MARCH1 E3 ubiquitin ligase.	J Cell Sci	2013	MARCH1, a member of the membrane-associated RING-CH family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, regulates antigen presentation by downregulating the cell surface expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex class II and CD86 molecules. MARCH1 is a transmembrane protein that exposes both its N- and C-terminus to the cytoplasm. We have conducted a structure-function analysis of its two cytoplasmic tails to gain insights into the trafficking of MARCH1 in the endocytic pathway. Fusion of the N-terminal portion of MARCH1 to a type II transmembrane reporter molecule revealed that this cytoplasmic tail contains endosomal sorting motifs. The C-terminal domain also appears to contain intracellular sorting signals because it reduced surface expression of a type I transmembrane reporter molecule. Mutation of the two putative C-terminal tyrosine-based sorting signals did not affect the activity of human MARCH1; however, it did reduce its incorporation into exosomes. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis pointed to a functional C-terminal 221VQNC224 sequence that affects the spatial organization of the two cytoplasmic regions. This motif is also found in other RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as parkin. Altogether, these findings highlight the complex regulation of MARCH1 trafficking in the endocytic pathway as well as the intricate interactions between its cytoplasmic tails.

Mol Biosyst	2013	Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for about 3% of all human malignancies and its incidence is increasing. There are no standard biomarkers currently used in the clinical management of patients with renal cell carcinoma. A promising strategy for new biomarker detection is comparative proteomics of urinary exosomes (UE), nanovesicles released by every epithelial cell facing the urinary space, enriched in renal proteins and excluding high-abundance plasmatic proteins, such as albumin. Aim of the work is to establish the protein profile of exosomes isolated from urines of RCC patient compared with control subjects. We enrolled 29 clear cell RCC patients and 23 control healthy subjects (CTRL), age and sex-matched, for urine collection and vesicle isolation by differential centrifugation. Such vesicles were morphologically and biochemically characterized and proved to share exosome properties. Proteomic analysis, performed on 9 urinary exosome (UE) pooled samples by gel based digestion followed by LC-MS/MS, led to the identification of 261 proteins from CTRL subject UE and 186 from RCC patient UE, and demonstrated that most of the identified proteins are membrane associated or cytoplasmic. Moreover, about a half of identified proteins are not shared between RCC and control UE. Starting from these observations, and from the literature, we selected a panel of 10 proteins, whose UE differential content was subjected to immunoblotting validation. Results show for the first time that RCC UE protein content is substantially and reproducibly different from control UE, and that these differences may provide clues for new RCC biomarker discovery.

Tumor cell-derived exosome-targeted dendritic cells stimulate stronger CD8+ CTL responses and antitumor immunities.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2013	Tumor cell-derived exosomes (TEX) have been widely used to induce antitumor immune responses in animal models and clinical trials. However, the efficiency of the antitumor immunity that is induced by TEX is still relatively weak. In this study, we compared the antitumor immunities between EG7 tumor cell-derived exosomes (EXO(EG7)) and EXO(EG7)-targeted dendritic cells (DC(EXO)). We found that EXO(EG7) harbored OVA and peptide major histocompatibility complex I (pMHC-I), which were expressed on its parental EG7 tmor cells, and they could transfer OVA and pMHC-I to dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro. DC(EXO) could more efficiently induce antitumor immunity than EXO(EG7). In addition, we showed that the immune stimulatory effects of EXO(EG7) were dependent on the host DCs and, whereas those of DC(EXO) were not, indicating the important role of the host DCs in TEX vaccines. Taken together, TEX-targeted DCs may be more effective for EXO-based vaccines for the induction of antitumor immunity.

Systemically circulating viral and tumor-derived microRNAs in KSHV-associated malignancies.	PLoS Pathog	2013	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are stable, small non-coding RNAs that modulate many downstream target genes. Recently, circulating miRNAs have been detected in various body fluids and within exosomes, prompting their evaluation as candidate biomarkers of diseases, especially cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common AIDS-associated cancer and remains prevalent despite Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART). KS is caused by KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a gamma herpesvirus also associated with Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL). We sought to determine the host and viral circulating miRNAs in plasma, pleural fluid or serum from patients with the KSHV-associated malignancies KS and PEL and from two mouse models of KS. Both KSHV-encoded miRNAs and host miRNAs, including members of the miR-17-92 cluster, were detectable within patient exosomes and circulating miRNA profiles from KSHV mouse models. Further characterization revealed a subset of miRNAs that seemed to be preferentially incorporated into exosomes. Gene ontology analysis of signature exosomal miRNA targets revealed several signaling pathways that are known to be important in KSHV pathogenesis. Functional analysis of endothelial cells exposed to patient-derived exosomes demonstrated enhanced cell migration and IL-6 secretion. This suggests that exosomes derived from KSHV-associated malignancies are functional and contain a distinct subset of miRNAs. These could represent candidate biomarkers of disease and may contribute to the paracrine phenotypes that are a characteristic of KS.	PMC3715412

Osteoprotegerin in exosome-like vesicles from human cultured tubular cells and urine.	PLoS One	2013	Urinary exosomes have been proposed as potential diagnostic tools. TNF superfamily cytokines and receptors may be present in exosomes and are expressed by proximal tubular cells. We have now studied the expression of selected TNF superfamily proteins in exosome-like vesicles from cultured human proximal tubular cells and human urine and have identified additional proteins in these vesicles by LC-MS/MS proteomics. Human proximal tubular cells constitutively released exosome-like vesicles that did not contain the TNF superfamily cytokines TRAIL or TWEAK. However, exosome-like vesicles contained osteoprotegerin (OPG), a TNF receptor superfamily protein, as assessed by Western blot, ELISA or selected reaction monitoring by nLC-(QQQ)MS/MS. Twenty-one additional proteins were identified in tubular cell exosome-like vesicles, including one (vitamin D binding protein) that had not been previously reported in exosome-like vesicles. Twelve were extracellular matrix proteins, including the basement membrane proteins type IV collagen, nidogen-1, agrin and fibulin-1. Urine from chronic kidney disease patients contained a higher amount of exosomal protein and exosomal OPG than urine from healthy volunteers. Specifically OPG was increased in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease urinary exosome-like vesicles and expressed by cystic epithelium in vivo. In conclusion, OPG is present in exosome-like vesicles secreted by proximal tubular epithelial cells and isolated from Chronic Kidney Disease urine.	PMC3751949

Myotube-derived exosomal miRNAs downregulate Sirtuin1 in myoblasts during muscle cell differentiation.	Cell Cycle	2014	It has recently been established that exosomes can mediate intercellular cross-talk under normal and pathological conditions through the transfer of specific miRNAs. As muscle cells secrete exosomes, we addressed the question of whether skeletal muscle (SkM) exosomes contained specific miRNAs, and whether they could act as "endocrine signals" during myogenesis. We compared the miRNA repertoires found in exosomes released from C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes and found that 171 and 182 miRNAs were exported into exosomes from myoblasts and myotubes, respectively. Interestingly, some miRNAs were expressed at higher levels in exosomes than in their donor cells and vice versa, indicating a selectivity in the incorporation of miRNAs into exosomes. Moreover miRNAs from C2C12 exosomes were regulated during myogenesis. The predicted target genes of regulated exosomal miRNAs are mainly involved in the control of important signaling pathways for muscle cell differentiation (e.g., Wnt signaling pathway). We demonstrated that exosomes from myotubes can transfer small RNAs (C. elegans miRNAs and siRNA) into myoblasts. Moreover, we present evidence that exosome miRNAs secreted by myotubes are functionally able to silence Sirt1 in myoblasts. As Sirt1 regulates muscle gene expression and differentiation, our results show that myotube-exosome miRNAs could contribute to the commitment of myoblasts in the process of differentiation. Until now, myokines in muscle cell secretome provided a conceptual basis for communication between muscles. Here, we show that miRNA exosomal transfer would be a powerful means by which gene expression is orchestrated to regulate SkM metabolic homeostasis.	PMC3925739

Sumoylated hnRNPA2B1 controls the sorting of miRNAs into exosomes through binding to specific motifs.	Nat Commun	2013	Exosomes are released by most cells to the extracellular environment and are involved in cell-to-cell communication. Exosomes contain specific repertoires of mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and other non-coding RNAs that can be functionally transferred to recipient cells. However, the mechanisms that control the specific loading of RNA species into exosomes remain unknown. Here we describe sequence motifs present in miRNAs that control their localization into exosomes. The protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1) specifically binds exosomal miRNAs through the recognition of these motifs and controls their loading into exosomes. Moreover, hnRNPA2B1 in exosomes is sumoylated, and sumoylation controls the binding of hnRNPA2B1 to miRNAs. The loading of miRNAs into exosomes can be modulated by mutagenesis of the identified motifs or changes in hnRNPA2B1 expression levels. These findings identify hnRNPA2B1 as a key player in miRNA sorting into exosomes and provide potential tools for the packaging of selected regulatory RNAs into exosomes and their use in biomedical applications.

Connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) and microRNA-21 are components of a positive feedback loop in pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) during chronic pancreatitis and are exported in PSC-derived exosomes.	J Cell Commun Signal	2014	Pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas which, in its chronic form, involves tissue destruction, exocrine and endocrine insufficiency, increased risk of pancreatic cancer, and an extensive fibrotic pathology which is due to unrelenting collagen deposition by pancreatic stellate cells (PSC). In response to noxious agents such as alcohol-excessive consumption of which is a major cause of pancreatitis in the West-normally quiescent PSC undergo a phenotypic and functional transition to activated myofibroblasts which produce and deposit collagen at high levels. This process is regulated by connective tissue growth factor (CCN2), expression of which is highly up-regulated in activated PSC. We show that CCN2 production by activated PSC is associated with enhanced expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21) which was detected at high levels in activated PSC in a murine model of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. A positive feedback loop between CCN2 and miR-21 was identified that resulted in enhancement of their respective expression as well as that of collagen α1(I). Both miR-21 and CCN2 mRNA were present in PSC-derived exosomes, which were characterized as 50-150 nm CD9-positive nano-vesicles. Exosomes from CCN2-GFP- or miR-21-GFP-transfected PSC were taken up by other PSC cultures, as shown by direct fluorescence or qRT-PCR for GFP. Collectively these studies establish miR-21 and CCN2 as participants in a positive feedback loop during PSC activation and as components of the molecular payload in PSC-derived exosomes that can be delivered to other PSC. Thus interactions between cellular or exosomal miR-21 and CCN2 represent novel aspects of fibrogenic regulation in PSC. Summary Chronic injury in the pancreas is associated with fibrotic pathology which is driven in large part by CCN2-dependent collagen production in pancreatic stellate cells. This study shows that CCN2 up-regulation in PSC is associated with increased expression of miR-21 which, in turn, is able to stimulate CCN2 expression further via a positive feedback loop. Additionally miR-21 and CCN2 were identified in PSC-derived exosomes which effected their delivery to other PSC. The cellular and exosomal miR-21-CCN2 axis is a novel component in PSC fibrogenic signaling.	PMC4063995

Neurobiol Aging	2014	We present evidence here that exosomes stimulate aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42 in vitro and in vivo and interfere with uptake of Aβ by primary cultured astrocytes and microglia in vitro. Exosome secretion is prevented by the inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), a key regulatory enzyme generating ceramide from sphingomyelin, with GW4869. Using the 5XFAD mouse, we show that intraperitoneal injection of GW4869 reduces the levels of brain and serum exosomes, brain ceramide, and Aβ1-42 plaque load. Reduction of total Aβ1-42 as well as number of plaques in brain sections was significantly greater (40% reduction) in male than female mice. Our results suggest that GW4869 reduces amyloid plaque formation in vivo by preventing exosome secretion and identifies nSMase2 as a potential drug target in AD by interfering with exosome secretion.

To determine functional consequences of alterations in exosomal biomolecules in inflammation and pain, we investigated exosome-mediated information transfer in vitro, in a rodent model of inflammatory pain, and in exosomes from patients with CRPS. Mouse macrophage cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharides secrete exosomes containing elevated levels of cytokines and miRNAs that mediate inflammation. Transcriptome sequencing of exosomal RNA revealed global alterations in both innate and adaptive immune pathways. Exosomes from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells were sufficient to cause nuclear factor-κB activation in naive cells, indicating functionality in recipient cells. A single injection of exosomes attenuated thermal hyperalgesia in a murine model of inflammatory pain, suggesting an immunoprotective role for macrophage-derived exosomes. Macrophage-derived exosomes carry a protective signature that is altered when secreting cells are exposed to an inflammatory stimulus. We also show that circulating miRNAs altered in patients with complex regional pain syndrome are trafficked by exosomes. With their systemic signaling capabilities, exosomes can induce pleiotropic effects potentially mediating the multifactorial pathology underlying chronic pain, and should be explored for their therapeutic utility.

Novel method for extracting exosomes of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.	World J Gastroenterol	2014	AIM: To develop a novel method for the rapid and efficient extraction of exosomes secreted by tumor cells. METHODS: Unlike the traditional extraction method, the supernatants of cell cultures were concentrated, and the exosomes were isolated promptly and effectively using a novel nanomaterial called ExoQuick. Coomassie brilliant blue staining was used for protein quantification, and the morphology of the exosomes extracted by both methods was visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Exosome marker proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. Two potential hepatoma-associated proteins, tissue transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) and annexin A2, were analyzed. RESULTS: The exosomes separated by the new extraction assay based on the nanomaterial were disc-shaped, intact vesicles with lipid bilayer membranes. They were approximately 30-100 nm in diameter, which is similar to the diameter of exosomes isolated by the traditional method. The protein concentration of exosomes extracted by the new method was approximately 780 μg/10(8) cells, and therefore, it was 19 times higher than that of exosomes extracted in the traditional manner. There were differences between the total proteins of Huh-7 cells and the exosomal proteins. Typical exosome proteins, such as the transmembrane protein CD63 and heat shock protein 70, were confirmed. Two potential hepatoma-associated proteins were also identified. TGM2 was first found to exist in the exosomes of human liver cancer cells, but annexin A2 was not secreted into exosomes. CONCLUSION: The new extraction method based on the nanomaterial is quick and efficient. The cancer-associated protein TGM2 can be secreted through an exosome-mediated non-classical secretion pathway, and it may be a valuable tumor marker.	PMC4047354

Evidence for the Involvement of MMP14 in MMP2 Processing and Recruitment in Exosomes of Corneal Fibroblasts.	Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci	2015	PURPOSE: Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 14 has been shown to promote angiogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated exosomal transport of MMP14 and its target, MMP2, from corneal fibroblasts to vascular endothelial cells as a possible mechanism governing MMP14 activity in corneal angiogenesis. METHODS: We isolated MMP14-containing exosomes from corneal fibroblasts by sucrose density gradient and evaluated exosome content and purity by Western blot analysis. We then investigated exosome transport in vitro from corneal fibroblasts to two populations of vascular endothelial cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells (CPAECs). Western blot analysis and gelatin zymography were used to determine levels of MMP14 and MMP2, respectively, in exosomal fractions derived from cultured wild-type, MMP14 enzymatic domain-deficient (MMP14Δexon4), and MMP14-null corneal fibroblasts. RESULTS: Matrix metalloproteinase 14-containing exosomes isolated from corneal fibroblasts were readily taken up in vitro by HUVECs and CPAECs. We found that MMP14 was enriched in exosomal fractions of cultured corneal fibroblasts. Moreover, loss of the MMP14 enzymatic domain resulted in accumulation of pro-MMP2 protein in exosomes, whereas MMP2 was nearly undetectable in exosomes of MMP14-null fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that exosomes secreted by corneal fibroblasts can transport proteins, including MMP14, to vascular endothelial cells. In addition, recruitment of MMP2 into corneal fibroblast exosomes is an active process that depends, at least in part, on the presence of MMP14. The role of exosomal MMP14 transport in corneal angiogenesis has important implications for therapeutic applications targeting angiogenic processes in the cornea.	PMC4538964

Systemic exosomal siRNA delivery reduced alpha-synuclein aggregates in brains of transgenic mice.	Mov Disord	2014	Alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregates are the main component of Lewy bodies, which are the characteristic pathological feature in Parkinson's disease (PD) brain. Evidence that α-Syn aggregation can be propagated between neurones has led to the suggestion that this mechanism is responsible for the stepwise progression of PD pathology. Decreasing α-Syn expression is predicted to attenuate this process and is thus an attractive approach to delay or halt PD progression. We have used α-Syn small interfering RNA (siRNA) to reduce total and aggregated α-Syn levels in mouse brains. To achieve widespread delivery of siRNAs to the brain we have peripherally injected modified exosomes expressing Ravies virus glycoprotein loaded with siRNA. Normal mice were analyzed 3 or 7 days after injection. To evaluate whether this approach can decrease α-Syn aggregates, we repeated the treatment using transgenic mice expressing the human phosphorylation-mimic S129D α-Syn, which exhibits aggregation. In normal mice we detected significantly reduced α-Syn messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels throughout the brain 3 and 7 days after treatment with RVG-exosomes loaded with siRNA to α-Syn. In S129D α-Syn transgenic mice we found a decreased α-Syn mRNA and protein levels throughout the brain 7 days after injection. This resulted in significant reductions in intraneuronal protein aggregates, including in dopaminergic neurones of the substantia nigra. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of RVG-exosome delivery of siRNA to delay and reverse brain α-Syn pathological conditions.	PMC4204174

Quantitative proteomic analysis of exosome protein content changes induced by hepatitis B virus in Huh-7 cells using SILAC labeling and LC-MS/MS.	J Proteome Res	2014	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection could cause hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV-mediated pathogenesis is only partially understood, but X protein (HBx) reportedly possesses oncogenic potential. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles with diverse functions released by various cells including hepatocytes, and HBV harnesses cellular exosome biogenesis and export machineries for virion morphogenesis and secretion. Therefore, HBV infection might cause changes in exosome contents with functional implications for both virus and host. In this work, exosome protein content changes induced by HBV and HBx were quantitatively analyzed by SILAC/LC-MS/MS. Exosomes prepared from SILAC-labeled hepatoma cell line Huh-7 transfected with HBx, wildtype, or HBx-null HBV replicon plasmids were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Systematic analyses of MS data and confirmatory immunoblotting showed that HBx overexpression and HBV, with or without HBx, replication in Huh-7 cells indeed caused marked and specific changes in exosome protein contents. Furthermore, specific changes in protein contents were also detected in exosomes purified from HBV-infected patients' sera compared with control sera negative for HBV markers. These results illustrate a new aspect of interactions between HBV and the host and provide the foundation for future research into roles played by exosomes in HBV infection and pathogenesis.

Histol Histopathol	2015	Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent somatic cells that can differentiate into a variety of mature cell types. Over recent years, their biological in vitro and in vivo properties have elicited great expectations in the field of regenerative medicine, immunotherapy and tumour treatment. An increasing number of experimental observations suggest that their biological effects are probably related to a paracrine mechanism via the release of trophic factors and cytokines as well as through the production of membrane vesicles (MVs). These are nanometric membrane-bound structures, comprising shedding vesicles (SV) and exosomes (Ex), that enclose and transfer signalling molecules to target cells. We hypothesized that MVs may be implicated in the biological effects of MSCs from horse adipose tissue (E-AdMSCs), a type of MSC that has been extensively studied in recent years for its remarkable efficacy in tissue regeneration. By means of electron microscopy, we ascertained, for the first time, that equine adipose-derived MSCs constitutively produce MVs (E-Ad-MSCs). The analysis of MVs separated by ultracentrifugation allowed us to describe their general morphological features. Through the examination of cell monolayers by TEM, additionally, we distinguished the different pathways of SV and Ex formation, demonstrating that both fractions are produced by E-AdMSC. The accurate description of MV heterogeneous morphological characteristics led us to emphasize the possible implications of the relationship between different morphologies versus different functions. The data presented in this paper has an additional value, as they can be noteworthy for horses as well as for other mammalian species, including humans.

Exosome-dependent and independent mechanisms are involved in prion-like transmission of propagated Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase misfolding.	Prion	2014	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal adult-onset degenerative neuromuscular disorder with a poorly defined etiology, progresses in an orderly spatiotemporal manner from one or more foci within the nervous system, reminiscent of prion disease pathology. We have previously shown that misfolded mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), mutation of which is associated with a subset of ALS cases, can induce endogenous wild-type SOD1 misfolding in the intracellular environment in a templating fashion similar to that of misfolded prion protein. Our recent observations further extend the prion paradigm of pathological SOD1 to help explain the intercellular transmission of disease along the neuroaxis. It has been shown that both mutant and misfolded wild-type SOD1 can traverse cell-to-cell either as protein aggregates that are released from dying cells and taken up by neighboring cells via macropinocytosis, or released to the extracellular environment on the surface of exosomes secreted from living cells. Furthermore, once propagation of misfolded wild-type SOD1 has been initiated in human cell culture, it continues over multiple passages of transfer and cell growth. Propagation and transmission of misfolded wild-type SOD1 is therefore a potential mechanism in the systematic progression of ALS pathology.	PMC4601269

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2015	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), specifically exosomes and microvesicles (MVs), are presumed to play key roles in cell-cell communication via transfer of biomolecules between cells. The biogenesis of these two types of EVs differs as they originate from either the endosomal (exosomes) or plasma (MVs) membranes. To elucidate the primary means through which EVs mediate intercellular communication, we characterized their ability to encapsulate and deliver different types of macromolecules from transiently transfected cells. Both EV types encapsulated reporter proteins and mRNA but only MVs transferred the reporter function to recipient cells. De novo reporter protein expression in recipient cells resulted only from plasmid DNA (pDNA) after delivery via MVs. Reporter mRNA was delivered to recipient cells by both EV types, but was rapidly degraded without being translated. MVs also mediated delivery of functional pDNA encoding Cre recombinase in vivo to tissues in transgenic Cre-lox reporter mice. Within the parameters of this study, MVs delivered functional pDNA, but not RNA, whereas exosomes from the same source did not deliver functional nucleic acids. These results have significant implications for understanding the role of EVs in cellular communication and for development of EVs as delivery tools. Moreover, studies using EVs from transiently transfected cells may be confounded by a predominance of pDNA transfer.	PMC4378439

Electronic address: .	d.yellon@ucl.ac.uk		Plasma exosomes protect the myocardium from ischemia-reperfusion injury.	J Am Coll Cardiol	2015	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles released from cells into the blood, where they can transmit signals throughout the body. Shown to act on the heart, exosomes' composition and the signaling pathways they activate have not been explored. We hypothesized that endogenous plasma exosomes can communicate signals to the heart and provide protection against ischemia and reperfusion injury. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to isolate and characterize exosomes from rats and healthy volunteers, evaluate their cardioprotective actions, and identify the molecular mechanisms involved. METHODS: The exosome-rich fraction was isolated from the blood of adult rats and human volunteers and was analyzed by protein marker expression, transmission electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. This was then used in ex vivo, in vivo, and in vitro settings of ischemia-reperfusion, with the protective signaling pathways activated on cardiomyocytes identified using Western blot analyses and chemical inhibitors. RESULTS: Exosomes exhibited the expected size and expressed marker proteins CD63, CD81, and heat shock protein (HSP) 70. The exosome-rich fraction was powerfully cardioprotective in all tested models of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. We identified a pro-survival signaling pathway activated in cardiomyocytes involving toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and various kinases, leading to activation of the cardioprotective HSP27. Cardioprotection was prevented by a neutralizing antibody against a conserved HSP70 epitope expressed on the exosome surface and by blocking TLR4 in cardiomyocytes, identifying the HSP70/TLR4 communication axis as a critical component in exosome-mediated cardioprotection. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes deliver endogenous protective signals to the myocardium by a pathway involving TLR4 and classic cardioprotective HSPs.

Electronic address: .	yaotang@gru.edu		Exosomes/microvesicles from induced pluripotent stem cells deliver cardioprotective miRNAs and prevent cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the ischemic myocardium.	Int J Cardiol	2015	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) exhibit enhanced survival and proliferation in ischemic tissues. However, the therapeutic application of iPS cells is limited by their tumorigenic potential. We hypothesized that iPS cells can transmit cytoprotective signals to cardiomyocytes via exosomes/microvesicles. METHODS: Exosomes/microvesicles secreted from mouse cardiac fibroblast (CF)-derived iPS cells (iPS-exo) were purified from conditioned medium and confirmed by electron micrograph, size distribution and zeta potential by particle tracking analyzer and protein expression of the exosome markers CD63 and Tsg101. RESULTS: We observed that exosomes are at low zeta potential, and easily aggregate. Temperature affects zeta potential (-14 to -15 mV at 23 °C vs -24 mV at 37 °C). The uptake of iPS-exo protects H9C2 cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress by inhibiting caspase 3/7 activation (P < 0.05, n = 6). Importantly, iPS-exo treatment can protect against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MIR) injury via intramyocardial injection into mouse ischemic myocardium before reperfusion. Furthermore, iPS-exo deliver cardioprotective miRNAs, including nanog-regulated miR-21 and HIF-1α-regulated miR-210, to H9C2 cardiomyocytes in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes/microvesicles secreted by iPS cells are very effective at transmitting cytoprotective signals to cardiomyocytes in the setting of MIR. iPS-exo thus represents novel biological nanoparticles that offer the benefits of iPS cell therapy without the risk of tumorigenicity and can potentially serve as an "off-the-shelf" therapy to rescue ischemic cardiomyocytes in conditions such as MIR.

26100252	Etienne Moussay	Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg;			Exosomes released by chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells induce the transition of stromal cells into cancer-associated fibroblasts.	Blood	2015	Exosomes derived from solid tumor cells are involved in immune suppression, angiogenesis, and metastasis, but the role of leukemia-derived exosomes has been less investigated. The pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is stringently associated with a tumor-supportive microenvironment and a dysfunctional immune system. Here, we explore the role of CLL-derived exosomes in the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which malignant cells create this favorable surrounding. We show that CLL-derived exosomes are actively incorporated by endothelial and mesenchymal stem cells ex vivo and in vivo and that the transfer of exosomal protein and microRNA induces an inflammatory phenotype in the target cells, which resembles the phenotype of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). As a result, stromal cells show enhanced proliferation, migration, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, contributing to a tumor-supportive microenvironment. Exosome uptake by endothelial cells increased angiogenesis ex vivo and in vivo, and coinjection of CLL-derived exosomes and CLL cells promoted tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. Finally, we detected α-smooth actin-positive stromal cells in lymph nodes of CLL patients. These findings demonstrate that CLL-derived exosomes actively promote disease progression by modulating several functions of surrounding stromal cells that acquire features of cancer-associated fibroblasts.

Exosomal miRNAs from Peritoneum Lavage Fluid as Potential Prognostic Biomarkers of Peritoneal Metastasis in Gastric Cancer.	PLoS One	2015	Peritoneal metastasis is the most frequent type of recurrence in patients with gastric cancer (GC) and is associated with poor prognosis. Peritoneal lavage cytology, used to evaluate the risk of peritoneal metastasis, has low sensitivity. Here, we assessed the diagnostic potential of exosomal miRNA profiles in peritoneal fluid for the prediction of peritoneal dissemination in GC. Total RNA was extracted from exosomes isolated from six gastric malignant ascites (MA) samples, 24 peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF) samples, and culture supernatants (CM) of two human gastric carcinoma cell lines that differ in their potential for peritoneal metastasis. Expression of exosomal miRNAs was evaluated with Agilent Human miRNA microarrays and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The microarray analysis indicated a low variability in the number and signal intensity of miRNAs detected among the samples. In the six MA fluids, miR-21 showed the highest signal intensity. We identified five miRNAs (miR-1225-5p, miR-320c, miR-1202, miR-1207-5p, and miR-4270) with high expression in MA samples, the PLF of serosa-invasive GC, and the CM of a highly metastatic GC cell line; these candidate miRNA species appear to be related to peritoneal dissemination. Differential expression of miR-21, miR-320c, and miR-1225-5p was validated in the PLF of serosa-invasive and non-invasive GC by qRT-PCR and miR-21 and miR-1225-5p were confirmed to be associated with serosal invasion in GC. PLF can be used to profile the expression of exosomal miRNAs. Our findings suggest that miR-21 and miR-1225-5p may serve as biomarkers of peritoneal recurrence after curative GC resection, thus providing a novel approach to early diagnosis of peritoneal dissemination of GC.

Exosomal miR-223 Contributes to Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Elicited Cardioprotection in Polymicrobial Sepsis.	Sci Rep	2015	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to elicit cardio-protective effects in sepsis. However, the underlying mechanism remains obscure. While recent studies have indicated that miR-223 is highly enriched in MSC-derived exosomes, whether exosomal miR-223 contributes to MSC-mediated cardio-protection in sepsis is unknown. In this study, loss-of-function approach was utilized, and sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We observed that injection of miR-223-KO MSCs at 1 h post-CLP did not confer protection against CLP-triggered cardiac dysfunction, apoptosis and inflammatory response. However, WT-MSCs were able to provide protection which was associated with exosome release. Next, treatment of CLP mice with exosomes released from miR-223-KO MSCs significantly exaggerated sepsis-induced injury. Conversely, WT-MSC-derived-exosomes displayed protective effects. Mechanistically, we identified that miR-223-KO exosomes contained higher levels of Sema3A and Stat3, two known targets of miR-223 (5p &3p), than WT-exosomes. Accordingly, these exosomal proteins were transferred to cardiomyocytes, leading to increased inflammation and cell death. By contrast, WT-exosomes encased higher levels of miR-223, which could be delivered to cardiomyocytes, resulting in down-regulation of Sema3A and Stat3. These data for the first time indicate that exosomal miR-223 plays an essential role for MSC-induced cardio-protection in sepsis.	PMC4562230

J Leukoc Biol	2016	The lectin galectin-9 may help establish and maintain chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Galectin-9 is elevated in the liver and sera of hepatitis C virus patients, induces apoptosis of hepatitis C virus-specific T cells, and increases inhibitory regulatory T cells. Kupffer cells stain strongly for galectin-9 protein in hepatitis C virus patients. In the current study, we determined stimuli that induce galectin-9 production by monocytes and macrophages in hepatitis C virus infection. With the use of real-time PCR and flow cytometry, we analyzed galectin-9 mRNA and protein from human monocytes cocultured with hepatitis C virus-infected cells or noninfectious hepatitis C virus subgenomic replicon cells. We focused on finding the stimuli for galectin-9 production. Additionally, we measured galectin-9 during monocyte-to-macrophage maturation. Finally, we examined galectin-9 in peripheral monocytes from hepatitis C virus patients using flow cytometry. Galectin-9 mRNA increased 8-fold when primary monocytes were exposed to hepatitis C virus--infected cells. Maximum induction required proximity or contact and did not require IFN-γ or hepatitis C virus virions. Coculture of monocytes with subgenomic replicon cells increased galectin-9 5-fold, and purified exosomes from infected cells stimulated galectin-9 production. Stimulation of monocyte TLR3, -7, and -8 increased galectin-9 production. Differentiation of monocytes to macrophages increased galectin-9, and nonclassic monocytes from hepatitis C virus patients had the highest levels of galectin-9. Hepatitis C virus-infected cells stimulated monocytes to produce galectin-9 in close proximity, possibly, in part, as a result of exosomes and endosomal TLRs. Differentiation of monocytes to macrophages increased galectin-9. Nonclassic monocytes from hepatitis C virus patients express the highest galectin-9 levels, suggesting they may contribute to elevated galectin-9 and adaptive immune inhibition in hepatitis C virus infection.

Macrophage Exosomes Induce Placental Inflammatory Cytokines: A Novel Mode of Maternal-Placental Messaging.	Traffic	2016	During pregnancy, the placenta forms the interface between mother and fetus. Highly controlled regulation of trans-placental trafficking is therefore essential for the healthy development of the growing fetus. Extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer of protein and nucleic acids from the human placenta into the maternal circulation is well documented; the possibility that this trafficking is bi-directional has not yet been explored but could affect placental function and impact on the fetus.We hypothesized that the ability of the placenta to respond to maternal inflammatory signals is mediated by the interaction of maternal immune cell exosomes with placental trophoblast. Utilizing the BeWo cell line and whole placental explants, we demonstrated that the human placenta internalizes macrophage-derived exosomes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This uptake was via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, macrophage exosomes induced release of proinflammatory cytokines by the placenta. Taken together, our data demonstrates that exosomes are actively transported into the human placenta and that exosomes from activated immune cells modulate placental cytokine production. This represents a novel mechanism by which immune cells can signal to the placental unit, potentially facilitating responses to maternal inflammation and infection, and thereby preventing harm to the fetus.

Isolation of Exosomes from Blood Plasma: Qualitative and Quantitative Comparison of Ultracentrifugation and Size Exclusion Chromatography Methods.	PLoS One	2015	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are emerging targets for biomedical research. However, suitable methods for the isolation of blood plasma-derived exosomes without impurities have not yet been described. AIM: Therefore, we investigated the efficiency and purity of exosomes isolated with potentially suitable methods; differential ultracentrifugation (UC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). METHODS AND RESULTS: Exosomes were isolated from rat and human blood plasma by various UC and SEC conditions. Efficiency was investigated at serial UC of the supernatant, while in case of SEC by comparing the content of exosomal markers of various fractions. Purity was assessed based on the presence of albumin. We found that the diameter of the majority of isolated particles fell into the size range of exosomes, however, albumin was also present in the preparations, when 1h UC at 4°C was applied. Furthermore, with this method only a minor fraction of total exosomes could be isolated from blood as deduced from the constant amount of exosomal markers CD63 and TSG101 detected after serial UC of rat blood plasma samples. By using UC for longer time or with shorter sedimentation distance at 4°C, or UC performed at 37°C, exosomal yield increased, but albumin impurity was still observed in the isolates, as assessed by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and immunoblotting against CD63, TSG101 and albumin. Efficiency and purity were not different in case of using further diluted samples. By using SEC with different columns, we have found that although a minor fraction of exosomes can be isolated without significant albumin content on Sepharose CL-4B or Sephacryl S-400 columns, but not on Sepharose 2B columns, the majority of exosomes co-eluted with albumin. CONCLUSION: Here we show that it is feasible to isolate exosomes from blood plasma by SEC without significant albumin contamination albeit with low vesicle yield.	PMC4686892

Assessing cellular and circulating miRNA recovery: the impact of the RNA isolation method and the quantity of input material.	Sci Rep	2016	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising cancer biomarkers. However, exploiting their informative potential requires careful optimization of their detection. Here, we compared the efficiency of commonly used RNA extraction kits in miRNA recovery from cells, plasma and urine/plasma-derived exosomes, using single-gene RT-qPCR and miRNA profiling. We used increasing amounts of starting material to investigate the impact of the input material size on miRNA extraction. We showed that miRNA recovery was largely influenced by the isolation method and by the amount of input material. In particular, the miRCURY™ kit provided highly pure RNA. However, its columns poorly recovered miRNAs from limiting amounts of cells and plasma, and rapidly saturated by large RNA species and plasma components, thus impeding miRNA recovery from high input amounts. Overall, the miRNeasy® kit permitted a better miRNA detection despite a less pure extracted RNA. Nevertheless, some miRNAs were preferentially or exclusively isolated by either of the methods. Trizol® LS resulted in very low purity RNA which affected RT-qPCR efficiency. In general, miRCURY™ biofluids kit efficiently extracted miRNAs from plasma. A careful selection of the RNA isolation method and the consideration of the type and size of input material are highly recommended to avoid biased results.	PMC4726450

Clinical and biological significance of HAX-1 overexpression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.	Oncotarget	2016	HS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) is an important marker in many types of cancers and contributes to cancer progression and metastasis. We examined the expression of HAX-1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and experimentally manipulated its expression. We observed that HAX-1 expression is elevated in NPC and is correlated with lymph node metastasis, M classification, clinical stage, and poor prognosis. In addition, overexpression of HAX-1 promoted NPC proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Exosomes are potential carriers of pro-tumorigenic factors that participate in oncogenesis. We found that NPC-derived exosomes are enriched in HAX-1 and accelerate NPC tumor growth and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that oncogenic HAX-1 facilitates the growth of NPC when it is transferred via exosomes to recipient human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Oncogenic HAX-1 also increases the proliferation, migration, and angiogenic activity of HUVECs. Our findings provide unique insight into the pathogenesis of NPC and underscore the need to explore novel therapeutic targets such as HAX-1 to improve NPC treatment.	PMC4914301

Electronic address: .	rghidoni@fatebenefratelli.eu		Loss of exosomes in progranulin-associated frontotemporal dementia.	Neurobiol Aging	2016	Many cells of the nervous system have been shown to release exosomes, a subclass of secreted vesicles of endosomal origin capable of transferring biomolecules among cells: this transfer modality represents a novel physiological form of intercellular communication between neural cells. Herein, we demonstrated that progranulin (PGRN), a protein targeted to the classical secretory pathway, is also secreted in association with exosomes by human primary fibroblasts. Moreover, we demonstrated that null mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN), a major cause of frontotemporal dementia, strongly reduce the number of released exosomes and alter their composition. In vitro GRN silencing in SHSY-5Y cells confirmed a role of PGRN in the control of exosome release. It is believed that depletion of PGRN in the brain might cause neurodegeneration in GRN-associated frontotemporal dementia. We demonstrated that, along with shortage of the circulating PGRN, GRN null mutations alter intercellular communication. Thus, a better understanding of the role played by exosomes in GRN-associated neurodegeneration is crucial for the development of novel therapies for these diseases.

Electronic address: .	stefaan.desmedt@ugent.be		Comparing exosome-like vesicles with liposomes for the functional cellular delivery of small RNAs.	J Control Release	2016	Exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) play an important role in intercellular communication by acting as natural carriers for biomolecule transfer between cells. This unique feature rationalizes their exploitation as bio-inspired drug delivery systems. However, the therapeutic application of ELVs is hampered by the lack of efficient and reproducible drug loading methods, in particular for therapeutic macromolecules. To overcome this limitation, we present a generic method to attach siRNA to the surface of isolated ELVs by means of a cholesterol anchor. Despite a feasible uptake in both a dendritic and lung epithelial cell line, B16F10- and JAWSII-derived ELVs were unable to functionally deliver the associated small RNAs, neither exogenous cholesterol-conjugated siRNA nor endogenous miRNA derived from the melanoma producer cell. The latter results were confirmed both for purified ELVs and ELVs delivered via a transwell co-culture set-up. In contrast, simple anionic fusogenic liposomes were able to induce a marked siRNA-mediated gene knockdown under equal experimental conditions, both indicating successful cytosolic delivery of surface-bound cholesterol-conjugated siRNA and further underscoring the incapacity of the here evaluated ELVs to guide cytosolic delivery of small RNAs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a more in-depth understanding of the biomolecular delivery mechanism and specificity is required before ELVs can be envisioned as a generic siRNA carrier.

Characterization and Small RNA Content of Extracellular Vesicles in Follicular Fluid of Developing Bovine Antral Follicles.	Sci Rep	2016	Exosomes and microvesicles (i.e., extracellular vesicles: EVs) have been identified within ovarian follicular fluid and recent evidence suggests that EVs are able to elicit profound effects on ovarian cell function. While existence of miRNA within EVs has been reported, whether EV size and concentration as well as their cargos (i.e., proteins and RNA) change during antral follicle growth remains unknown. Extracellular vesicles isolated from follicular fluid of small, medium and large bovine follicles were similar in size, while concentration of EVs decreased progressively as follicle size increased. Electron microscopy indicated a highly purified population of the lipid bilayer enclosed vesicles that were enriched in exosome biomarkers including CD81 and Alix. Small RNA sequencing identified a large number of known and novel miRNAs that changed in the EVs of different size follicles. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) indicated that miRNA abundant in small follicle EV preparations were associated with cell proliferation pathways, while those miRNA abundant in large follicle preparations were related to inflammatory response pathways. These studies are the first to demonstrate that EVs change in their levels and makeup during antral follicle development and point to the potential for a unique vesicle-mediated cell-to-cell communication network within the ovarian follicle.

Cancer Res	2016	Malignant progression results from a dynamic cross-talk between stromal and cancer cells. Recent evidence suggests that this cross-talk is mediated to a significant extent by exosomes, nanovesicles secreted by most cell types and which allow the transfer of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells. Adipocytes are a major component of several tumor microenvironments, including that of invasive melanoma, where cells have migrated to the adipocyte-rich hypodermic layer of the skin. We show that adipocytes secrete exosomes in abundance, which are then taken up by tumor cells, leading to increased migration and invasion. Using mass spectrometry, we analyzed the proteome of adipocyte exosomes. Interestingly, these vesicles carry proteins implicated in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), a feature highly specific to adipocyte exosomes. We further show that, in the presence of adipocyte exosomes, FAO is increased in melanoma cells. Inhibition of this metabolic pathway completely abrogates the exosome-mediated increase in migration. Moreover, in obese mice and humans, both the number of exosomes secreted by adipocytes as well as their effect on FAO-dependent cell migration are amplified. These observations might in part explain why obese melanoma patients have a poorer prognosis than their nonobese counterparts. Cancer Res; 76(14); 4051-7. ©2016 AACR.

J Transl Med	2016	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are nano-sized extracellular vesicles participating in cell-to-cell communication both in health and disease. However, the knowledge about the functions and molecular composition of exosomes in the upper airways is limited. The aim of the current study was therefore to determine whether nasal exosomes can influence inflammatory cells and to establish the proteome of nasal lavage fluid-derived exosomes in healthy subjects, as well as its alterations in individuals with chronic airway inflammatory diseases [asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)]. METHODS: Nasal lavage fluid was collected from 14 healthy subjects, 15 subjects with asthma and 13 subjects with asthma/CRS. Exosomes were isolated with differential centrifugation and the proteome was analysed by LC-MS/MS with the application of two exclusion lists as well as using quantitative proteomics. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis and GO Term finder was used to predict the functions associated with the exosomal proteome and a migration assay was used to analyse the effect on immune cells by nasal exosomes. RESULTS: Firstly, we demonstrate that nasal exosomes can induce migration of several immune cells, such as monocytes, neutrophils and NK cells in vitro. Secondly, a mass spectrometry approach, with the application of exclusion lists, was utilised to generate a comprehensive protein inventory of the exosomes from healthy subjects. The use of exclusion lists resulted in the identification of ~15 % additional proteins, and increased the confidence in ~20 % of identified proteins. In total, 604 proteins were identified in nasal exosomes and the nasal exosomal proteome showed strong associations with immune-related functions, such as immune cell trafficking. Thirdly, a quantitative proteomics approach was used to determine alterations in the exosome proteome as a result of airway inflammatory disease. Serum-associated proteins and mucins were more abundant in the exosomes from subjects with respiratory diseases compared to healthy controls while proteins with antimicrobial functions and barrier-related proteins had decreased expression. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal exosomes were shown to induce the migration of innate immune cells, which may be important as the airway epithelium is the first line of defence against pathogens and allergens. The decreased expression in barrier and antimicrobial exosomal proteins in subjects with airway diseases, could possibly contribute to an increased susceptibility to infections, which have important clinical implications in disease progression.

CD44v6-competent tumor exosomes promote motility, invasion and cancer-initiating cell marker expression in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells.	Oncotarget	2016	Cancer-initiating cells (CIC) account for metastatic spread, which may rely mostly on CIC exosomes (TEX) that affect host cells and can transfer CIC features into Non-CIC. The CIC marker CD44 variant isoform v6 (CD44v6) being known for metastasis-promotion, we elaborated in cells its contribution to migration and invasion and in TEX the tranfer of migratory and invasive capacity to Non-CIC, using a CD44v6 knockdown (CD44v6kd) as Non-CIC model.A CD44v6kd in human pancreatic and colorectal cancer (PaCa, CoCa) lines led to loss of CIC characteristics including downregulation of additional CIC markers, particularly Tspan8. This aggravated the loss of CD44v6-promoted motility and invasion. Loss of motility relies on the distorted cooperation of CD44v6 and Tspan8 with associated integrins and loss of invasiveness on reduced protease expression. These deficits, transferred into TEX, severely altered the CD44v6kd-TEX composition. As a consequence, unlike the CIC-TEX, CD44v6kd TEX were not taken up by CD44v6kd cells and CIC. The uptake of CIC-TEX was accompanied by partial correction of CIC marker and protease expression in CD44v6kd cells, which regained migratory, invasive and metastatic competence. CIC-TEX also fostered angiogenesis and expansion of myeloid cells, likely due to a direct impact of CIC-TEX on the host, which could be supported by reprogrammed CD44v6kd cells.Taken together, the striking loss of tumor progression by a CD44v6kd relies on the capacity of CD44v6 to cooperate with associating integrins and proteases and its promotion of additional CIC marker expression. The defects by a CD44v6kd are efficiently corrected upon CIC-TEX uptake.	PMC5342426

Electronic address: .	jieliang.li@temple.edu		Exosomes contribute to the transmission of anti-HIV activity from TLR3-activated brain microvascular endothelial cells to macrophages.	Antiviral Res	2016	Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), the major cell type in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), play a key role in maintaining brain homeostasis. However, their role in the BBB innate immunity against HIV invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) remains to be determined. Our early work showed that TLR3 signaling of HBMECs could produce the antiviral factors that inhibit HIV replication in macrophages. The present study examined whether exosomes from TLR3-activated HBMECs mediate the intercellular transfer of antiviral factors to macrophages. Primary human macrophages could take up exosomes from TLR3-activated HBMECs. HBMECs-derived exosomes contained multiple antiviral factors, including several key IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs; ISG15, ISG56, and Mx2) at mRNA and protein levels. The depletion of exosomes from TLR3-activated HBMECs culture supernatant diminished HBMECs-mediated anti-HIV activity in macrophages. In conclusion, we demonstrate that exosomes shed by HBMECs are able to transport the antiviral molecules to macrophages. This finding suggests the possibility that HIV nonpermissive BBB cells (HBMECs) can help to restore the antiviral state in HIV-infected macrophages, which may be a defense mechanism against HIV neuroinvasion.

Oncol Rep	2016	Pancreatobiliary tract cancer is a highly fatal cancer. Detection of pancreatobiliary tract cancer is difficult because it lacks typical clinical symptoms and because of its anatomical location. Biomarker discovery is therefore important to detect pancreatobiliary tract cancer in its early stage. A study demonstrated that expression levels of miR‑1246, miR‑3976, miR‑4306, and miR‑4644 in serum exosomes were higher in pancreatic cancer patients than these levels in healthy control participants. Supposing that microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in saliva are similar to those in serum, four miRNAs (miR‑1246, miR‑3976, miR‑4306, and miR‑4644) in salivary exosomes may also be useful for detection of pancreatobiliary tract cancer. In this study, it was examined whether these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for pancreatobiliary tract cancer. Twelve pancreatobiliary tract cancer patients and 13 healthy control participants were analyzed as a cancer and a control group, respectively. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected, salivary exosomes were isolated, and total RNA was extracted. Using quantitative real‑time PCR (RT‑qPCR), the relative expression ratios of miR‑1246 and miR‑4644 were significantly higher in the cancer group than these ratios in the control group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to analyze the discrimination power of these miRNAs. For miR‑1246, the results yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.814 (P=0.008). For miR‑4644, the results yielded an AUC of 0.763 (P=0.026). For the combination of miR‑1246 and miR‑4644, the results yielded an increased AUC of 0.833 (P=0.005). This pilot study suggests that miR‑1246 and miR‑4644 in salivary exosomes could be candidate biomarkers for pancreatobiliary tract cancer.

Eur J Pharm Sci	2017	In the last decade, the number of studies related with extracellular vesicles (EVs) has dramatically grown since their role as key part of intercellular communication has been confirmed. EVs, as transporter of distinct bioactive molecules, can take part in different physiological mechanisms and have been gaining attention as potential tools with a wide range of therapeutic effects. Whereas a high number of studies have been published related to mammalian derived EVs, including products as food source, the existence of EVs in plants still is controversial. Recent descriptions of vesicles derived from edible plants show that they might contain pharmacological active molecules. In this context, EVs from food are attracting increasing interest due to their relevance in modulating cellular processes (involved in health and disease), as well as therapeutic vehicles. The present work aims to summarize the current knowledge on exosomes in foods, actually limited to only four FAO groups (Milk, Starchy roots and tubers, Nuts and seeds, and Fruits). In addition, we have further characterized EVs isolated from grape berry juice by classical differential centrifugation, and described a preliminary dissection of their secretion in vivo.

Exosome-driven transfer of tumor-associated Pioneer Translation Products (TA-PTPs) for the MHC class I cross-presentation pathway.	Oncoimmunology	2016	Cellular immune reactions against non-self-epitopes require activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells via cross-presentation of MHC class I-restricted peptides by professional antigen presenting cells (pAPCs), with the consequent detection and elimination of cells expressing the same antigens via the endogenous (direct) pathway. The source of peptides for the endogenous pathway is constituted of alternative mRNA translation products; however, it is still unclear which source of peptides is used for cross-presentation. Furthermore, the presentation of non-canonical translation products, produced during a non-conventional translation event, on class I molecules of tumor cells has been reported but how these peptides are generated, presented to pAPCs, and their capacity to stimulate CD8+ T cells is still not known. Here, we report that pioneer translation peptides (PTPs) derived from intron or exon pre-mRNAs can serve as tumor-associated antigens (TA-PTPs) and are delivered from the producing tumor cells to pAPCs via exosomes where they are processed by the cytosolic pathway. Injection of TA-PTPs and tumor-derived exosomes efficiently induce CD8+ T-cell proliferation and prevent tumor growth in mice. Our results show that TA-PTPs represent an efficient source of antigenic peptides for CD8+ T cell activation and that full-length proteins are not required for cross-presentation. These findings can have interesting implications for generating tolerance and for designing vectors to generate vaccines.	PMC5048765

Methods Mol Biol	2017	Next-generation deep sequencing (NGS) technology represents a powerful and innovative approach to profile small RNA. Currently, there are a number of large-scale and benchtop sequencing platforms available on the market. Although each platform is relatively straightforward to operate, constructing cDNA libraries can be the most difficult part of the NGS workflow. Constructing quality libraries is essential to obtaining a successful sequencing run of high-quality reads and coverage. The quality and yield of RNA affect hybridization and ligation of sequencing adapters. In the field of biomarker discovery, there has been an interest in profiling exosomal RNA from biological fluids. However, very little RNA yield is obtained when extracting RNA from exosomes, thus making library construction difficult. Here, this protocol describes an optimized protocol for constructing small RNA libraries from low yields of RNA, in particular, extracted from exosomes isolated from biological fluids.

Exosomes derived from miR-140-5p-overexpressing human synovial mesenchymal stem cells enhance cartilage tissue regeneration and prevent osteoarthritis of the knee in a rat model.	Theranostics	2017	OBJECTIVES: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease throughout the world. Exosomes derived from miR-140-5p-overexpressing synovial mesenchymal stem cells (SMSC-140s) may be effective in treating OA. We hypothesized that exosomes derived from SMSC-140 (SMSC-140-Exos) would enhance the proliferation and migration abilities of articular chondrocytes (ACs) without harming extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion. METHODS: SMSCs were transfected with or without miR-140-5p. Exosomes derived from SMSCs or SMSC-140s (SMSC-Exos or SMSC-140-Exos) were isolated and identified. Proliferation, migration and ECM secretion were measured in vitro and compared between groups. The mechanism involving alternative Wnt signalling and activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) was investigated using lentivirus, oligonucleotides or chemical drugs. The preventative effect of exosomes in vivo was measured using Safranin-O and Fast green staining and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Wnt5a and Wnt5b carried by exosomes activated YAP via the alternative Wnt signalling pathway and enhanced proliferation and migration of chondrocytes with the side-effect of significantly decreasing ECM secretion. Highly-expressed miR-140-5p blocked this side-effect via RalA. SMSC-140-Exos enhanced the proliferation and migration of ACs without damaging ECM secretion in vitro, while in vivo, SMSC-140-Exos successfully prevented OA in a rat model. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the promising potential of SMSC-140-Exos in preventing OA. We first found a potential source of exosomes and studied their merits and shortcomings. Based on our understanding of the molecular mechanism, we overcame the shortcomings by modifying the exosomes. Such exosomes derived from modified cells hold potential as future therapeutic strategies.	PMC5196895

A Comparative Study of Serum Exosome Isolation Using Differential Ultracentrifugation and Three Commercial Reagents.	PLoS One	2017	Exosomes play a role in cell-to-cell signaling and serve as possible biomarkers. Isolating exosomes with reliable quality and substantial concentration is a major challenge. Our purpose is to compare the exosomes extracted by three different exosome isolation kits (miRCURY, ExoQuick, and Invitrogen Total Exosome Isolation Reagent) and differential ultracentrifugation (UC) using six different volumes of a non-cancerous human serum (5 ml, 1 ml, 500 μl, 250 μl, 100 μl, and 50 μl) and three different volumes (1 ml, 500 μl and 100 μl) of six individual commercial serum samples collected from human donors. The smaller starting volumes (100 μl and 50 μl) are used to mimic conditions of limited availability of heterogeneous biological samples. The isolated exosomes were characterized based upon size, quantity, zeta potential, CD63 and CD9 protein expression, and exosomal RNA (exRNA) quality and quantity using several complementary methods: nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) with ZetaView, western blot, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the Agilent Bioanalyzer system, and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Our NTA results showed that all isolation techniques produced exosomes within the expected size range (40-150 nm). The three kits, though, produced a significantly higher yield (80-300 fold) of exosomes as compared to UC for all serum volumes, except 5 mL. We also found that exosomes isolated by the different techniques and serum volumes had similar zeta potentials to previous studies. Western blot analysis and TEM immunogold labelling confirmed the expression of two common exosomal protein markers, CD63 and CD9, in samples isolated by all techniques. All exosome isolations yielded high quality exRNA, containing mostly small RNA with a peak between 25 and 200 nucleotides in size. ddPCR results indicated that exosomes isolated from similar serum volumes but different isolation techniques rendered similar concentrations of two selected exRNA: hsa-miR-16 and hsa-miR-451. In summary, the three commercial exosome isolation kits are viable alternatives to UC, even when limited amounts of biological samples are available.	PMC5256994

Exosomes Derived from Akt-Modified Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improve Cardiac Regeneration and Promote Angiogenesis via Activating Platelet-Derived Growth Factor D.	Stem Cells Transl Med	2017	We have previously demonstrated the cardioprotective effects of exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). It is well known that the activation of Akt is involved in stem cell-induced cardioprotection. In the present study, we investigated whether exosomes released from Akt-overexpressing MSCs showed a beneficial effect on cardioprotection and angiogenesis. MSCs were collected from human umbilical cord (hucMSCs), and Akt was transfected into hucMSCs (Akt-hucMSCs) by using an adenovirus transfection system. Exosomes were isolated from control hucMSCs (Exo) and Akt-hucMSCs (Akt-Exo). An acute myocardial infarction model was created by ligation of the left anterior decedent coronary artery (LAD) in rats. Various source exosomes (400 µg of protein) were infused via the tail vein immediately after LAD ligation. The cardiac function was evaluated by using echocardiography after different treatments for 1 and 5 weeks, respectively. Endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube-like structure formation, as well as chick allantoic membrane assay, were used to evaluate the angiogenetic effects of Akt-Exo. The results indicated that cardiac function was significantly improved in the animals treated with Akt-Exo. In addition, Akt-Exo significantly accelerated endothelial cell proliferation and migration, tube-like structure formation in vitro, and blood vessel formation in vivo. The expression of platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGF-D) was significantly upregulated in Akt-Exo. However, the angiogenesis was abrogated in endothelial cells treated with the exosomes obtained from MSCs transfected with PDGF-D-siRNA. Our studies suggest that exosomes obtained from Akt-modified hucMSCs are more effective in myocardial infarction therapy through promoting angiogenesis. PDGF-D plays an important role in Akt-Exo-mediated angiogenesis. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2017;6:51-59.	PMC5442756

Mult Scler	2018	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that provide cell-to-cell communication and are involved in immunoregulation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate serum exosomes for the presence of myelin proteins outside the central nervous system (CNS) and their role in multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected from 45 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 30 patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and 45 healthy controls. Exosomes were isolated using a polymer formulation method, and their size, concentration, and CNS myelin protein contents were measured by a nanoparticle tracking analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and Western blot. RESULTS: We found that exosomes expressed three major myelin proteins, myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Exosomal content of MOG strongly correlated with disease activity and was highest in RRMS patients in relapse and in SPMS patients. Serum-derived exosomes induced proliferation of MOG-T cell receptor transgenic T cells confirming that serum exosomes maintained MOG immunogenicity. CONCLUSION: Exosomes isolated outside CNS tissue expressed myelin proteins, and the presence of MOG correlated strongly with disease activity. We conclude that exosomes might enhance and/or perpetuate anti-myelin immune reactions in MS and may provide novel markers of disease activity.

The role of exosomes derived from cerebrospinal fluid of spinal cord injury in neuron proliferation in vitro.	Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol	2018	Exosomes is a key component of cell paracrine secretion and can exert important effects in various disease models. However, the role of exosomes in neuron repair of spinal cord injury (SCI) has rarely been reported. In this study, Exosomes were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of SCI and normal, and incubated neuron in vitro respectively to research its biological function in cell proliferation. The results demonstrated these exosomes all expressed CD9, CD63, CD81, Alix and Tsg101; however, only exosomes derived from cerebrospinal fluid of SCI could promote proliferation of neuron via ERK signaling pathway, and decrease cell apoptosis. Exosomes contain cytosolic content, including proteins, mRNAs and non-cording RNAs, and play a role in important biological function. Our research showed exosomes derived from cerebrospinal fluid of SCI, they can influence neuron cell proliferation in vitro, we did not observe these characters in exosome derived from normal cerebrospinal fluid.

Electrophoresis	2017	The quest for new cell-free DNA and exosome biomarker-based molecular diagnostics require fast and efficient sample preparation techniques. Conventional methods for isolating these biomarkers from blood are both time-consuming and laborious. New electrokinetic microarray devices using dielectrophoresis (DEP) to isolate cell-free DNA and exosome biomarkers have now greatly improved the sample preparation process. Nevertheless, these devices still have some limitations when used with high conductance biological fluids, e.g. blood, plasma, and serum. This study demonstrates that electrochemical damage may occur on the platinum electrodes of DEP microarray devices. It further examines two model device designs that include a parallel wire arrangement and a planar array. Effective isolation of fluorescent beads with parallel wires is shown under low-conductance conditions (10-4 S/m), but electrothermal flow overcomes DEP forces under high conductance conditions (>0.1 S/m). Planar devices are shown to be effective under high conductance conditions (∼1 S/m) without the deleterious effects of electrothermal flow. This study provides new insights into design compromises and limitations for producing future electrokinetic devices for better performance with high conductance solutions.

Thromb Res	2017	Platelet activation and endothelial damage play essential roles in atherosclerosis. The pathophysiology of this process is mediated by chemokines and exosomes, two critical players in cell communication. Thrombin-activated platelet-derived exosomes have protective effects on atherosclerosis and endothelial inflammation. To confirm these findings, we isolated exosomes using differential ultracentrifugation and transmission electron microscopy. The exosomes were identified using NanoSight-tracking analysis. Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were performed to assess exosome uptake and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that the levels of miR-223, miR-339 and miR-21 were elevated in thrombin-activated platelet exosomes. This finding was verified in our atherosclerosis mouse model. We also found that miR-223 transfection in HUVECs inhibited ICAM-1 expression under TNF-α stimulation. Furthermore, the miR-223 inhibitor blocked the downregulating effects of exosomes on ICAM-1 expression. We examined the key proteins of two classical signaling pathways, MAPK and NF-κB, and found that miR-223 inhibited the phosphorylation of p38, JNK and ERK and blocked the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Our results suggest that thrombin-activated platelet-derived exosomes inhibit ICAM-1 expression during inflammation. MiR-223 may mediate this process via regulation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways.

J Biol Chem	2017	HIV-1 infection causes AIDS, infecting millions worldwide. The virus can persist in a state of chronic infection due to its ability to become latent. We have previously shown a link between HIV-1 infection and exosome production. Specifically, we have reported that exosomes transport viral proteins and RNA from infected cells to neighboring uninfected cells. These viral products could then elicit an innate immune response, leading to activation of the Toll-like receptor and NF-κB pathways. In this study, we asked whether exosomes from uninfected cells could activate latent HIV-1 in infected cells. We observed that irrespective of combination antiretroviral therapy, both short- and long-length viral transcripts were increased in wild-type HIV-1-infected cells exposed to purified exosomes from uninfected cells. A search for a possible mechanism for this finding revealed that the exosomes increase RNA polymerase II loading onto the HIV-1 promoter in the infected cells. These viral transcripts, which include trans-activation response (TAR) RNA and a novel RNA that we termed TAR-gag, can then be packaged into exosomes and potentially be exported to neighboring uninfected cells, leading to increased cellular activation. To better decipher the exosome release pathways involved, we used siRNA to suppress expression of ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) proteins and found that ESCRT II and IV significantly control exosome release. Collectively, these results imply that exosomes from uninfected cells activate latent HIV-1 in infected cells and that true transcriptional latency may not be possible in vivo, especially in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy.

Hydrogen Peroxide Stimulates Exosomal Cathepsin B Regulation of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-Products (RAGE).	J Cell Biochem	2018	Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles that are secreted into the extracellular environment. These vesicles contain various biological effector molecules that can regulate intracellular signaling pathways in recipient cells. The aim of this study was to examine a correlation between exosomal cathepsin B activity and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). Type 1 alveolar epithelial (R3/1) cells were treated with or without hydrogen peroxide and exosomes isolated from the cell conditioned media were characterized by NanoSight analysis. Lipidomic and proteomic analysis showed exosomes released from R3/1 cells exposed to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide or vehicle differ in their lipid and protein content, respectively. Cathepsin B activity was detected in exosomes isolated from hydrogen peroxide treated cells. The mRNA and protein expression of RAGE increased in cultured R3/1 cells treated with exosomes containing active cathepsin B while depletion of exosomal cathepsin B attenuated RAGE mRNA and protein expression. These results suggest exosomal cathepsin B regulates RAGE in type 1 alveolar cells under conditions of oxidative stress. J. Cell. Biochem. 119: 599-606, 2018. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

EVs have been shown to modulate immune responses; recently, MVs were described to carry microRNA (miRNA) and a role for MVs in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases has been discussed. Here we systematically characterized MVs and exosomes according to their release stimuli. The miRNA content of viable or apoptotic human T lymphocytes and the corresponding MVs was analyzed. miRNA, protein and surface marker expression, as well as cytokine release by human monocytes was measured after EV engulfment. Finally, miRNA expression in T lymphocytes and MVs of healthy individuals was compared with those of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. We demonstrate that, depending on the stimuli, distinct subtypes of EVs are released, differing in size and carrying a specific RNA profile. We observed an accumulation of distinct miRNAs in MVs after induction of apoptosis and the transfer of functional miRNA by MVs into human monocytes. MVs released from apoptotic cells provoke less of an inflammatory response than those released from viable cells. MiR-155*, miR-34b and miR-34a levels in T lymphocytes and corresponding MVs were deregulated in SLE when compared to healthy individuals.

Eur Urol Focus	2016	BACKGROUND: Apart from an invasive biopsy, currently no tools are available to confirm the diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC); this resulted in approximately 30% of patients being diagnosed with metastatic disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether urinary microRNAs (miRNAs) can serve as biomarkers to confirm the diagnosis of ccRCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Global miRNA expression was assessed in 28 preoperative urine samples from patients with ccRCC and 18 healthy participants. The independent validation set consisted of 81 ccRCC patients, 24 patients with benign lesions, and 33 healthy participants. We extracted both cell-free and exosomal RNA for miRNA expression analysis using miRNA-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. We also investigated exosomal miRNA secretion in cell line models and performed exosome transfer between RCC and endothelial cell types. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Receiver operating characteristic analysis was applied to identify the discrimination power of miRNAs. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, miR-126-3p combined with miR-449a or with miR-34b-5p could significantly distinguish ccRCC patients from healthy participants (miR-126-3p-miR-449a: area under the curve [AUC]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7620-0.9151; p<0.001; miR-126-3p-miR-34b-5p: AUC: 0.79; 95% CI, 0.7013-0.8815; p<0.001). The combination of miR-126-3p and miR-34b-5p was also able to distinguish small renal masses (pT1a, ≤4cm) from healthy controls (AUC: 0.79; 95% CI, 0.6848-0.8980; p<0.001). Using miR-126-3p and miR-486-5p in combination, we were able to differentiate between benign lesions and ccRCC (AUC: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.7295-0.9615; p<0.01). The expression of a number of miRNAs returned to a level comparable with health after surgery. Kidney cancer cell lines were found to secrete exosomal miR-126-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-21-3p, and miR-25-3p, and these miRNAs were found to be internalized by other cell types. CONCLUSIONS: We identified exosomal miRNAs as potential noninvasive diagnostic urinary biomarkers for ccRCC and provided evidence that miRNAs are secreted by the tumor and can function as a tool for intercellular communication. PATIENT SUMMARY: We identified urinary microRNAs that can serve as diagnostic biomarkers for clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

J Immunother Cancer	2017	BACKGROUND: The suppressive nature of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment plays a major role in regulating anti-tumor immune responses. Our previous work demonstrated that a soluble factor from tumor cells is able to induce a suppressor phenotype (SP) in human CD8+ T cells typified by loss of CD27/CD28 expression and acquisition of a potent suppressor function. The present study hypothesized that the soluble mechanism that is inducing the SP in CD8+ T cells are tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs). METHODS: Membrane vesicles and TDEs from multiple head and neck cancer cell line's conditioned growth media were isolated by ultracentrifugation and precipitation, respectively. Human purified CD3+CD8+ T cells were assessed for their induction of the T cell SP by flow cytometry identifying loss of CD27/CD28 expression and in vitro suppression assays. Furthermore, the T cell SP was characterized for the attenuation of IFN-γ production. To delineate exosomal proteins contributing to T cell SP, mass spectrometry was used to identify unique proteins that were present in TDEs. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout constructs were used to examine the role of one of these proteins, galectin-1. To assess the role of exosomal RNA, RNA purified from TDEs was nucleofected into CD8+ T cells followed by suppression analysis. RESULTS: Using fractionated conditioned growth media, factors >200 kDa induced CD8+ T cell SP, which was determined to be an exosome by mass spectrometry analysis. Multiple head and neck cancer-derived cell lines were found to secrete T cell SP-inducing exosomes. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that an immunoregulatory protein, galectin-1 (Gal-1), was expressed in those exosomes, but not in TDEs unable to induce T cell SP. Galectin-1 knockout cells were found to be less able to induce T cell SP. Furthermore, RNA purified from the T cell SP-inducing exosomes were found to partially induce the SP when transfected into normal CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: For the first-time, TDEs have been identified to induce a SP in CD8+ T cells and their mode of action may be synergistic effects from exosomal proteins and RNA. One protein in particular, galectin-1, appears to play a significant role in inducing T cell SP. Therefore, tumor-derived immunosuppressive exosomes are a potential therapeutic target to prevent T cell dysfunction and enhance anti-tumor immune responses.	PMC5556362

Microb Pathog	2017	Targeted immune therapies are a modern approach to harness the immunity to treat cancer patients. Exosomes (EXOs) are nano-vesicles used for drug delivery in cancer treatment. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of novel designed EXO structures for immunotherapy alone and in combination with other components in animal models. EXO derived from untreated macrophage (EXO), WEHI-164 cell lysate treated EXO (EXOLys), HSP70 enriched WEHI-164 cell lysate treated EXO (EXOHSP70), Naloxone (NLX) treated EXO (EXONLX), Propranolol (PRP) treated EXO (EXOPRP) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) anchored to three kinds of EXOs designated as EXO/SEB, EXOLys/SEB, EXOHSP70/SEB were purified from J774 cell line. To determine the therapeutic effect of these novel constructed nano-vesicles, the animals were immunized with different types of EXOs at weekly intervals for three consecutive weeks and in the fourth week the WEHI-164 tumor cells were injected. Finally, the splenocyte proliferation was examined by MTT assay and tumor growth was also determined in each group. We observed that EXOHSP was more effective than EXO and EXOLys to decrease the number of tumor cells and to stimulate immune responses in animal models (P < 0.05). In SEB-anchored EXO group, EXOHSP70/SEB has the potency to stimulate immune responses more efficiently than EXO/SEB and EXOLys/SEB and the tumor was not palpable until 28th day which may refer to synergistic effect of HSP70 and SEB on immunity. In EXONLX treated mice proliferative response decreased significantly compared to control group (P > 0.05) and the tumor number was constant within a period of 28 days and EXOPRP may delay the occurrence of the fibrosarcoma tumor; After development of fibrosarcoma the number of tumors diminished over the studied period of time. Our results demonstrate that HSP70 enriched EXO is an effective immunoadjuvant in cancer immunotherapy and causes tumor regression in animal model.

Int J Mol Sci	2017	The group of adipokines comprises hundreds of biological active proteins and peptides released from adipose tissue. Alterations of those complex protein signatures are suggested to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of multifactorial, metabolic diseases. We hypothesized that also the pathophysiology of type-2-diabetes is linked to the dysregulation of the adipocyte secretome. To test this, we investigated mouse models with monogenic defects in leptin signaling which are susceptible to adipositas (C57BL/6 Cg-Lepob (obob)) or adipositas with diabetes (C57BL/KS Cg-Leprdb (dbdb)) according to their genetic background. At the age of 17 weeks, visceral fat was obtained and primary murine adipocytes were isolated to harvest secretomes. Quantitative proteome analyses (LC-ESI-MS/MS) identified more than 800 potential secreted proteins. The secretome patterns revealed significant differences connected to the pathophysiology of obese mice. Pathway analyses indicated that these differences focus on exosome modelling, but failed to provide more precise specifications. To investigate the relationship of secretome data to insulin sensitivity, we examined the content of diabetogenic lipids, i.e., diacylglycerols (DAGs), identified as key players in lipid-induced insulin resistance. In contrast to obob mice, fat tissue of dbdb mice showed elevated DAG content, especially of DAG species with saturated fatty acid C16:0 and C18:0, while unsaturated fatty acid C16:1 were only changed in obob. Furthermore, DAG signatures of the models specifically correlate to secreted regulated adipokines indicating specific pathways. In conclusion, our data further support the concept that the fat tissue is an endocrine organ that releases bioactive factors corresponding to adipose tissue health status.	PMC5618577
28936266	P Shannon Pendergrast	Ymir Genomics LLC, Cambridge, MA, USA.			A novel method for the isolation of extracellular vesicles and RNA from urine.	J Circ Biomark	2017 Jan-Dec	The discovery of urinary extracellular biomarkers has been impeded by the lack of efficient methods for the isolation of extracellular vesicles (EVs: exosomes and microvesicles) and extracellular nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) from urine. Ultracentrifugation (UC), considered the gold standard for vesicle isolation from many biofluids, is efficacious but laborious, and, like most commercially available methods, is unable to isolate enough material from small volumes for protein or RNA-based biomarker discovery. We have developed a novel precipitation method for the isolation of EVs and nucleic acids from urine. The method, which is now commercially available, takes less than 30 min and does not require polyethylene glycol. Transmission electron microscopy and Nanosight particle analysis confirm that the method isolates intact vesicles with a similar size, shape, and number to UC. Immunoblot analysis of preparations made from a variety of urine samples demonstrates that the method isolates multiple vesicle protein markers more efficiently than other commercial kits, especially from more diluted samples. Bioanalyzer, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and array analysis show that the method is extremely efficient at the isolation of extracellular miRNAs. The Ymir Genomics EV and Extracellular RNA Isolation Kits offer an efficient and rapid alternative to UC and other commercial kits.	PMC5548307

Stage-specific follicular extracellular vesicle uptake and regulation of bovine granulosa cell proliferation.	Biol Reprod	2017	Follicular fluid within ovarian antral follicles contains numerous factors, which influence the development of a healthy oocyte including nucleic acids, steroids, proteins, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Current evidence indicates that follicular EVs promote changes in cellular gene expression and support cumulus-oocyte complex expansion in vitro. In this study, we found EVs from different sized follicles differentially stimulate granulosa cell proliferation and this could be explained by both the differential contents associated, on or within the vesicles and by the preferential uptake of EVs dependent on follicle size from which they were isolated. Antibody array and inhibitor studies indicated that the Src, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK signaling pathways mediate the stimulatory effects of EVs on granulosa cell proliferation. This study demonstrates for the first time that EVs isolated from follicular fluid are capable of stimulating granulosa cell proliferation and that this stimulatory response is associated with the size of antral follicle from which the EVs originated. The study further also provides the first evidence that vesicles released by small antral follicles are preferentially taken up when compared to those isolated from large follicles, suggesting that vesicular surface proteins change during follicular maturation.

Inflammation-Stimulated Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Attenuate Inflammation.	Stem Cells	2018	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been proposed to be a key mechanistic link in the therapeutic efficacy of cells in response to cellular injuries through paracrine effects. We hypothesize that inflammatory stimulation of MSCs results in the release of EVs that have greater anti-inflammatory effects. The present study evaluates the immunomodulatory abilities of EVs derived from inflammation-stimulated and naive MSCs (MSCEv+ and MSCEv, respectively) isolated using a current Good Manufacturing Practice-compliant tangential flow filtration system. Detailed characterization of both EVs revealed differences in protein composition, cytokine profiles, and RNA content, despite similarities in size and expression of common surface markers. MSCEv+ further attenuated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro when compared to MSCEv, with a distinctly different pattern of EV-uptake by activated primary leukocyte subpopulations. The efficacy of EVs was partially attributed to COX2/PGE2 expression. The present study demonstrates that inflammatory stimulation of MSCs renders release of EVs that have enhanced anti-inflammatory properties partially due to COX2/PGE2 pathway alteration.

Liver kinase B1 restoration promotes exosome secretion and motility of lung cancer cells.	Oncol Rep	2018	Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) regulates a variety of cellular functions, including cell polarity, energy metabolism and cell growth, by targeting multiple signaling pathways such as AMPK/mTOR and p53. LKB1 functions as a tumor suppressor in sporadic cancers including lung cancer. Extracellular vesicles such as exosomes secreted by cancer cells modulate the tumor microenvironment and progression by targeting both tumor cells (autocrine actions) and other types of cells associated with tumors (paracrine actions). While the roles of LKB1 in cellular signaling in general is well-studied, its specific role in exosome-mediated signaling remains to be explored. To this purpose, we reintroduced LKB1 into H460 and A549 lung cancer cells that are endogenously deficient in LKB1 expression. Notably, we found that while restoration of LKB1 significantly reduced lung cancer cell growth as expected, it greatly promoted cell motility and enhanced the release of exosomes. In addition, exosomes isolated from H460 cells with stable restoration of LKB1 had much higher ability in stimulating lung cancer cell migration than did those from H460 cells lacking LKB1. Mechanistically, restoration of LKB1 in H460 cells inhibited cellular expression and exosomal secretion of migration-suppressing microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-125a, miR-126 and let7b. Taken together, the present study revealed a new role for LKB1 in promoting cell motility by downregulating migration-suppressing miRNA expression and exosome secretion.	PMC5783601

Sci Rep	2017	The preservation of nucleic acids from clinical samples is critical to facilitate accurate molecular diagnosis. The use of a paper matrix, Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) Elute cards, to archive DNA and viral RNA is well-documented. However, the feasibility of FTA Elute cards for archiving serum and serum exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) remains unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of FTA Elute cards for miRNA storage and recovery in different pre-analytical conditions. The recovery of serum miRNA dry-spotted on FTA Elute cards by direct elution with water at high temperature was poor. However, serum miRNAs dry-spotted on the cards were isolated with about 40% yield when using QIAzol lysis reagent and recovery was improved remarkably (>80%) upon extraction from cards pre-treated with trehalose. miRNAs stored on the cards remained stable at room temperature and can be kept for prolonged periods. Furthermore, miRNAs could be similarly recovered from serum exosomes dry-spotted on the cards. Importantly, when using sera from gastric cancer (GC) patients, the miRNAs were efficiently recovered from trehalose pre-treated cards without affecting their representation. Collectively, we have demonstrated the potential of FTA Elute cards to archive serum and serum exosomal miRNAs, making it useful for biomarker discovery and diagnostics.	PMC5709463

BMC Res Notes	2017	OBJECTIVE: MiR-486 and miR-146a are cardiomyocyte-enriched microRNAs that control cell survival and self-regulation of inflammation. These microRNAs are released into circulation and are detected in plasma or in circulating exosomes. Little is known whether heart failure affects their release into circulation, which this study investigated. RESULTS: Total and exosome-specific microRNAs in plasma of 40 heart failure patients and 20 controls were prepared using the miRVana Kit. We measured exosomal and total plasma microRNAs separately because exosomes serve as cargos that transfer biological materials and alter signaling in distant organs, whereas microRNAs in plasma indicate the level of tissue damage and are mostly derived from dead cells. qRT-PCR was used to quantify miR-486, miR-146a, and miR-16. Heart failure did not significantly affect plasma miR-486/miR-16 and miR-146a/miR-16 ratio, although miR-146a/miR-16 showed a trend of elevated expression (2.3 ± 0.79, p = 0.27). By contrast, circulating exosomal miR-146a/miR-16 ratio was higher in heart failure patients (2.46 ± 0.51, p = 0.05). miR-146a is induced in response to inflammation as a part of inflammation attenuation circuitry. Indeed, Tnfα and Gm-csf increased miR-146a but not miR-486 in the cardiomyocyte cell line H9C2. These results, if confirmed in a larger study, may help to develop circulating exosomal miR-146a as a biomarker of heart failure.	PMC5735935

Cancer Immunol Res	2018	Nano-sized membrane-encapsulated extracellular vesicles isolated from the ascites fluids of ovarian cancer patients are identified as exosomes based on their biophysical and compositional characteristics. We report here that T cells pulsed with these tumor-associated exosomes during TCR-dependent activation inhibit various activation endpoints including translocation of NFκB and NFAT into the nucleus, upregulation of CD69 and CD107a, production of cytokines, and cell proliferation. In addition, the activation of virus-specific CD8+ T cells that are stimulated with the cognate viral peptides presented in the context of class I MHC is also suppressed by the exosomes. The inhibition occurs without loss of cell viability and coincidentally with the binding and internalization of these exosomes. This exosome-mediated inhibition of T cells was transient and reversible: T cells exposed to exosomes can be reactivated once exosomes are removed. We conclude that tumor-associated exosomes are immunosuppressive and represent a therapeutic target, blockade of which would enhance the antitumor response of quiescent tumor-associated T cells and prevent the functional arrest of adoptively transferred tumor-specific T cells or chimeric antigen receptor T cells.

Nat Immunol	2018	Malignancies can compromise innate immunity, but the mechanisms of this are largely unknown. Here we found that, via tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs), cancers were able to transfer activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to host macrophages and thereby suppress innate antiviral immunity. Screening of the human kinome identified the kinase MEKK2 in macrophages as an effector of TEX-delivered EGFR that negatively regulated the antiviral immune response. In the context of experimental tumor implantation, MEKK2-deficient mice were more resistant to viral infection than were wild-type mice. Injection of TEXs into mice reduced innate immunity, increased viral load and increased morbidity in an EGFR- and MEKK2-dependent manner. MEKK2 phosphorylated IRF3, a transcription factor crucial for the production of type I interferons; this triggered poly-ubiquitination of IRF3 and blocked its dimerization, translocation to the nucleus and transcriptional activity after viral infection. These findings identify a mechanism by which cancer cells can dampen host innate immunity and potentially cause patients with cancer to become immunocompromised.

J Neurotrauma	2018	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has high morbidity and mortality rates. The mechanisms underlying the TBI are unclear and may include the change in biological material in exosomes. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are enriched and stable in exosomes, which can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges to regulate gene expression levels. Therefore, we speculated that circRNAs in exosomes might play an important role in regulating gene expression after TBI and then regulate specific signaling pathways, which may protect the brain. We first isolated exosomes from the brain extracellular space in TBI mice by digestion. We then investigated the alterations in circRNA expression in exosomes by high-throughput whole transcriptome sequencing, analyzed the data by gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis, and constructed the circRNA-miRNA network. In this study, we identified 231 significantly and differentially expressed circRNAs, including 155 that were up-regulated and 76 that were down-regulated. GO analysis showed that these differentially expressed circRNAs might be related to the growth and repair of neurons, the development of the nervous system, and the transmission of nerve signals. The most highly correlated pathways that we identified were primarily involved with glutamatergic synapse and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The circRNA-miRNA network predicted the potential roles of these differentially expressed circRNAs and the interaction of circRNAs with miRNAs. Our study broadens the horizon of research on gene regulation in exosomes from the brain extracellular space after TBI and provides novel targets for further research on both the molecular mechanisms of TBI and the potential intervention therapy targets.

Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have altered microRNA profiles and induce osteogenic differentiation depending on the stage of differentiation.	PLoS One	2018	Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC)-derived exosomes have shown regenerative effects, but their role in osteogenesis and the underlying mechanism are yet to be determined. In this study, we examined the time-course secretion of exosomes by hMSCs during the entire process of osteogenic differentiation. Exosomes derived from hMSCs in various stages of osteogenic differentiation committed homotypic cells to differentiate towards osteogenic lineage, but only exosomes from late stages of osteogenic differentiation induced extracellular matrix mineralisation. Exosomes from expansion and early and late stages of osteogenic differentiation were internalised by a subpopulation of hMSCs. MicroRNA profiling revealed a set of differentially expressed exosomal microRNAs from the late stage of osteogenic differentiation, which were osteogenesis related. Target prediction demonstrated that these microRNAs enriched pathways involved in regulation of osteogenic differentiation and general mechanisms how exosomes exert their functions, such as "Wnt signalling pathway" and "endocytosis". Taken together, the results show that MSCs secrete exosomes with different biological properties depending on differentiation stage of their parent cells. The exosomal cargo transferred from MSCs in the late stage of differentiation induces osteogenic differentiation and mineralisation. Moreover, it is suggested that the regulatory effect on osteogenesis by exosomes is at least partly exerted by exosomal microRNA.	PMC5814093

Cell Immunol	2018	Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive malignant disease that is associated with Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) infection. To date, the mechanism of viral entry into NK cells remains uncertain. Here, we investigated this mechanism using human NK cells in vitro. CD21 mRNA expression, an EBV-entry receptor, was transiently detected in NK cells after exosome treatment, and levels decreased after further culture. CD21 protein expression was also transiently transferred to NK cells after co-culture with an EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Raji) via trogocytosis. However, EBV did not infect NK cells through CD21-mediated trogocytosis. Unexpectedly, when NK cell leukemia cells, as well as primary NK cells, were treated with viral supernatant, EBV genes, but not RNA, were detected in the NK cells, at latency stage 0. Therefore, these results suggest that EBV-NK cell infection results from the direct transfer of viral episomes, independent of EBV-positive B cells.

Exosomes from Suxiao Jiuxin pill-treated cardiac mesenchymal stem cells decrease H3K27 demethylase UTX expression in mouse cardiomyocytes in vitro.	Acta Pharmacol Sin	2018	Suxiao Jiuxin pill (SJP) is a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome in China, which contains two principal components, tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) and borneol (BOR). Thus far, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of SJP on the cardiac microenvironment are unknown. Cardiac mesenchymal stem cells (C-MSCs) communicate with cardiomyocytes (CMs) through the release of microvesicles (exosomes) to restore cardiac homeostasis and elicit repair, in part through epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we examined whether SJP treatment altered C-MSC-derived exosomes (SJP-Exos) to cause epigenetic chromatic remodeling in recipient CMs. C-MSC isolated from mouse hearts were pretreated with SJP (SJP-Exos), TMP (TMP-Exos) or BOR (BOR-Exos). Then, HL-1 cells, a mouse cardiomyocyte line, were treated with exosomes from control C-MSCs (Ctrl-Exos), SJP-Exos, TMP-Exos or BOR-Exos. Treatment with SJP-Exos significantly increased the protein levels of histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a key epigenetic chromatin marker for cardiac transcriptional suppression, in the HL-1 cells. To further explore the mechanisms of SJP-Exo-mediated H3K27me3 upregulation, we assessed the mRNA expression levels of key histone methylases (EZH1, EZH2 and EED) and demethylases (JMJD3 and UTX) in the exosome-treated HL-1 cells. Treatment with SJP-Exo selectively suppressed UTX expression in the recipient HL-1 cells. Furthermore, PCNA, an endogenous marker of cell replication, was significantly higher in SJP-Exo-treated HL-1 cells than in Ctrl-Exo-treated HL-1 cells. These results show that SJP-Exos increase cardiomyocyte proliferation and demonstrate that SJP can modulate C-MSC-derived exosomes to cause epigenetic chromatin remodeling in recipient cardiomyocytes; consequently, SJP-Exos might be used to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation.

Circ Res	2018	Rationale: A rapid and massive influx of inflammatory cells occurs into ischemic area following myocardial infarction, resulting in local release of cytokines and growth factors. Yet, the mechanisms regulating their production are not fully explored. The release of extracellular vesicles (EV) in the interstitial space curbs important biological functions, including inflammation, and influences the development of cardiovascular diseases. So far, there is no evidence for in situ release of cardiac EVs following myocardial infarction. Objective: The present study tested the hypothesis that local EV generation in the infarcted heart coordinates cardiac inflammation following myocardial infarction. Methods and Results: Coronary artery ligation in mice transiently increases EV levels in the left ventricle when compared to sham animals. EVs from infarcted hearts were characterized as large vesicles (252±18nm) expressing cardiomyocyte and endothelial markers, and small EVs (118±4nm) harboring exosomal markers such as CD63 and CD9. Cardiac large EVs generated after myocardial infarction, but not small EVs or sham EVs, increased the release of interleukin-6, chemokines CCL2, CCL7 from FACS-sorted Ly6C+ cardiac monocytes. EVs of similar diameter were also isolated from fragments of interventricular septum obtained from patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, thus supporting the clinical relevance of our findings in mice. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that acute myocardial infarction transiently increases the generation of cardiac EVs characterized as both exosomes and microvesicles, originating mainly from cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells.

Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev	2018	Background: Increasing studies suggest that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in carcinogenesis of human cancers and might be used as diagnostic biomarkers for cancers.Methods: A total of 301 participants were recruited in the first part of the study, including a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) group (n = 60), liver cirrhosis (LC) group (n = 85), chronic hepatitis B (CHB) group (n = 96), and healthy subjects (n = 60). In the second part, we collected 55 HCC patients, 60 CHB patients, and 60 healthy subjects as an independent cohort to validate the ability of the experiential lncRNAs for identifying HCC from CHB. A commercial kit was used to isolate serum exosomes and total RNA. The relative levels of lnRNAs and GAPDH mRNA were measured with TaqMan PCR.Results: The results showed that the levels of ENSG00000258332.1 and LINC00635 in the HCC group were significantly higher than those in the other groups (all P < 0.05). A high ENSG00000258332.1 level in HCC was associated with portal vein tumor emboli, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and overall survival (OS; all P < 0.05), and a high LINC00635 level was related to lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and OS (all P < 0.05). ENSG00000258332.1 discriminated HCC from CHB, gaining an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.719 (cutoff value of 1.345); LINC00635 gained an AUC of 0.750 (cutoff value of 1.690). Furthermore, the AUC for the combination of the 2 lncRNAs and serum AFP (cutoff value of 20 μg/L) was 0.894. The abilities of the 2 lncRNAs for identifying HCC from CHB were validated by an independent cohort.Conclusions: The results suggested that the combination of serum exosomal ENSG00000258332.1, LINC00635, and AFP may be a valuable assay in diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.Impact: Our data will shed light on exosomal lncRNAs as biomarkers for HCC.

Human Umbilical Cord MSC-Derived Exosomes Suppress the Development of CCl4-Induced Liver Injury through Antioxidant Effect.	Stem Cells Int	2018	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been increasingly applied into clinical therapy. Exosomes are small (30-100 nm in diameter) membrane vesicles released by different cell types and possess the similar functions with their derived cells. Human umbilical cord MSC-derived exosomes (hucMSC-Ex) play important roles in liver repair. However, the effects and mechanisms of hucMSC-Ex on liver injury development remain elusive. Mouse models of acute and chronic liver injury and liver tumor were induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) injection, followed by administration of hucMSC-Ex via the tail vein. Alleviation of liver injury by hucMSC-Ex was determined. We further explored the production of oxidative stress and apoptosis in the development of liver injury and compared the antioxidant effects of hucMSC-Ex with frequently used hepatic protectant, bifendate (DDB) in liver injury. hucMSC-Ex alleviated CCl4-induced acute liver injury and liver fibrosis and restrained the growth of liver tumors. Decreased oxidative stress and apoptosis were found in hucMSC-Ex-treated mouse models and liver cells. Compared to bifendate (DDB) treatment, hucMSC-Ex presented more distinct antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects. hucMSC-Ex may suppress CCl4-induced liver injury development via antioxidant potentials and could be a more effective antioxidant than DDB in CCl4-induced liver tumor development.

Optimizing exosomal RNA isolation for RNA-Seq analyses of archival sera specimens.	PLoS One	2018	Exosomes are endosome-derived membrane vesicles that contain proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The exosomal transcriptome mediates intercellular communication, and represents an understudied reservoir of novel biomarkers for human diseases. Next-generation sequencing enables complex quantitative characterization of exosomal RNAs from diverse sources. However, detailed protocols describing exosome purification for preparation of exosomal RNA-sequence (RNA-Seq) libraries are lacking. Here we compared methods for isolation of exosomes and extraction of exosomal RNA from human cell-free serum, as well as strategies for attaining equal representation of samples within pooled RNA-Seq libraries. We compared commercial precipitation with ultracentrifugation for exosome purification and confirmed the presence of exosomes via both transmission electron microscopy and immunoblotting. Exosomal RNA extraction was compared using four different RNA purification methods. We determined the minimal starting volume of serum required for exosome preparation and showed that high quality exosomal RNA can be isolated from sera stored for over a decade. Finally, RNA-Seq libraries were successfully prepared with exosomal RNAs extracted from human cell-free serum, cataloguing both coding and non-coding exosomal transcripts. This method provides researchers with strategic options to prepare RNA-Seq libraries and compare RNA-Seq data quantitatively from minimal volumes of fresh and archival human cell-free serum for disease biomarker discovery.

Uromodulin mRNA from Urinary Extracellular Vesicles Correlate to Kidney Function Decline in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.	Am J Nephrol	2018	BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) enclose mRNA derived from their cell of origin and are considered a source of potential biomarkers. We examined urinary EV mRNA from individuals with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and obese and healthy controls to determine if such biomarkers had the potential to classify kidney disease and predict patients at higher risk of renal function decline. METHODS: A total of 242 participants enrolled in this study. Urinary EV mRNA from all subjects were isolated by a filter-based platform, and the expression of 8 target genes were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in 161 T2DM patients were evaluated for 2 consecutive years and compared with EV RNA profiles at baseline. RESULTS: We observe that mild and severe DKD groups show a significant 3.2- and -4.4-fold increase in UMOD compared to healthy controls and expression increases linearly from healthy, diabetic, and DKD subjects. UMOD expression is significantly correlated to albumin creatinine ratio (ACR), eGFR, and HbA1c. Using linear discriminant analyses with mRNA from severe DKD and T2DM as training data, a multi-gene signature classified DKD and -non-DKD with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 73% with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) = 0.90. Although 6% of T2DM were determined to have a > 80% posterior probability of developing DKD based on this mRNA profile, eGFR changes observed within the 2-year follow-up did not reveal a decline in kidney function. CONCLUSION: Urinary EV UMOD mRNA levels are progressively elevated from T2DM to DKD groups and correlate with widely used eGFR and ACR diagnostic criteria. An EV mRNA signature could identify DKD with greater than 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity.

Exosomes as potent cell-free peptide-based vaccine. II. Exosomes in CpG adjuvants efficiently prime naive Tc1 lymphocytes leading to tumor rejection.	J Immunol	2004	Ideal vaccines should be stable, safe, molecularly defined, and out-of-shelf reagents efficient at triggering effector and memory Ag-specific T cell-based immune responses. Dendritic cell-derived exosomes could be considered as novel peptide-based vaccines because exosomes harbor a discrete set of proteins, bear functional MHC class I and II molecules that can be loaded with synthetic peptides of choice, and are stable reagents that were safely used in pioneering phase I studies. However, we showed in part I that exosomes are efficient to promote primary MHC class I-restricted effector CD8(+) T cell responses only when transferred onto mature DC in vivo. In this work, we bring evidence that among the clinically available reagents, Toll-like receptor 3 and 9 ligands are elective adjuvants capable of triggering efficient MHC-restricted CD8(+) T cell responses when combined to exosomes. Exosome immunogenicity across species allowed to verify the efficacy of good manufactory procedures-manufactured human exosomes admixed with CpG oligonucleotides in prophylactic and therapeutic settings of melanoma in HLA-A2 transgenic mice. CpG adjuvants appear to be ideal adjuvants for exosome-based cancer vaccines.

Nop53p, an essential nucleolar protein that interacts with Nop17p and Nip7p, is required for pre-rRNA processing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	FEBS J	2005	In eukaryotes, pre-rRNA processing depends on a large number of nonribosomal trans-acting factors that form large and intriguingly organized complexes. A novel nucleolar protein, Nop53p, was isolated by using Nop17p as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Nop53p also interacts with a second nucleolar protein, Nip7p. A carbon source-conditional strain with the NOP53 coding sequence under the control of the GAL1 promoter did not grow in glucose-containing medium, showing the phenotype of an essential gene. Under nonpermissive conditions, the conditional mutant strain showed rRNA biosynthesis defects, leading to an accumulation of the 27S and 7S pre-rRNAs and depletion of the mature 25S and 5.8S mature rRNAs. Nop53p did not interact with any of the exosome subunits in the yeast two-hybrid system, but its depletion affects the exosome function. In pull-down assays, protein A-tagged Nop53p coprecipitated the 27S and 7S pre-rRNAs, and His-Nop53p also bound directly 5.8S rRNA in vitro, which is consistent with a role for Nop53p in pre-rRNA processing.

Specific isolation of placenta-derived exosomes from the circulation of pregnant women and their immunoregulatory consequences.	Am J Reprod Immunol	2006 Nov-Dec	PROBLEM: One immunoregulatory pathway receiving little attention is placental exosome release. In normal pregnancy, as factors linked with early immunomodulation decline, placental exosomes become critical in modulating T-cell activation, suppressing effector T cells by enhancing lymphocyte apoptosis and CD3-zeta loss. METHOD OF STUDY: Placental exosomes were specifically isolated from the maternal peripheral circulation by a chromatographic/immunosorbent procedure. Exosomal suppression of T-cell signaling molecules on unfractionated T cells and T subsets was analyzed by Western immunoblot. The role of Fas ligand (FasL) was defined by use of Fas-blocking antibody. RESULTS: While exosomes of lymphoid origin could be demonstrated in all women, placenta-derived exosomes were only identified in pregnant patients. Placental exosomes suppressed T-cell expression of CD3-zeta and JAK3, while inducing SOCS-2. This downregulation of CD3-zeta was partially reversed by pre-incubating T cells with ZB4 antibody. Using T subsets, the level of CD3-zeta on CD8+ cells was inhibited 1.43-fold more than in CD4+ cells. On CD4+ CD25+ cells, CD3-zeta was not significantly inhibited. CONCLUSION: Placental exosomes suppressed T-cell signaling components; however, while exosomal FasL is an important contributor, it does not appear to be the sole mediator. The additional expression of PD-L1 may explain immunoregulatory consequences of exosomes with low or absent FasL.

J Allergy Clin Immunol	2007	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are vesicles of 30 to 100 nm produced by inward budding of endosomal compartments and are released by a range of different cell types. Exosomes from antigen-presenting cells carry immunorelevant molecules like MHC class I and II and costimulatory molecules and thus are suggested to have a role in immune modulation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of antigen-presenting cell derived exosomes in allergen presentation and T-cell stimulation. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from supernatants of B-cell lines derived from patients with birch pollen allergy. The exosomes were characterized with regard to the expression of surface molecules by flow cytometry. Moreover, exosomes were loaded with T-cell-activating peptides from the major birch allergen Bet v 1, and binding was tested with ELISA. Loaded exosomes were used for stimulation of Bet v 1-specific T-cell lines. Cell proliferation and cytokine production were assessed. RESULTS: The exosomes had a phenotype typical of B cell-derived exosomes with expression of MHC, costimulatory molecules like CD86, tetraspanin proteins such as CD81, and CD19. Furthermore, B cell-derived exosomes bound Bet v 1-derived peptides and subsequently induced a dose-dependent T-cell proliferation. In addition to proliferation, T cells synthesized the cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 in response to peptide-loaded exosomes. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate for the first time that exosomes isolated from B cells can present allergen-derived peptides and thereby induce T-cell proliferation and T(H)2-like cytokine production. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our data suggest that exosomes from B lymphocytes are an immunostimulatory factor in allergic immune responses.

Gynecol Oncol	2008	OBJECTIVES: Most ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage (67%) and prospects for significant improvement in survival reside in early diagnosis. While expression patterns of a recently identified biomarker family, microRNA, appear to be characteristic of tumor type and developmental origin, microRNA profiling has been limited to tissue specimens. Tumors actively release exosomes into the peripheral circulation and we now demonstrate the association of microRNAs with circulating tumor-derived exosomes. METHODS: Circulating tumor exosomes were isolated using a modified MACS procedure with anti-EpCAM. Initially, microRNA profiles of ovarian tumors were compared to those of tumor exosomes isolated from the same patients. Levels of 8 microRNAs (miR-21, miR-141, miR-200a, miR-200c, miR-200b, miR-203, miR-205 and miR-214) previously demonstrated as diagnostic, were compared in exosomes isolated from sera specimens of women with benign disease and various stages of ovarian cancer. RESULTS: MicroRNA from ovarian tumor cells and exosomes from the same patients were positive for 218 of 467 mature microRNAs analyzed. The levels of the 8 specific microRNAs were similar between cellular and exosomal microRNAs (exhibiting correlations from 0.71 to 0.90). While EpCAM-positive exosomes were detectable in both patients with benign ovarian disease and ovarian cancer, exosomal microRNA from ovarian cancer patients exhibited similar profiles, which were significantly distinct from profiles observed in benign disease. Exosomal microRNA could not be detected in normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that microRNA profiling of circulating tumor exosomes could potentially be used as surrogate diagnostic markers for biopsy profiling, extending its utility to screening asymptomatic populations.

Systemic presence and tumor-growth promoting effect of ovarian carcinoma released exosomes.	Cancer Lett	2009	Exosomes are membrane vesicles that are released from many different cell types. Tumor derived-exosomes play a role in immune suppression. We hypothesized that in ovarian carcinoma patients exosomes initially produced at the local abdominal site may become systemic. We examined paired samples of ascites and blood from ovarian carcinoma patients for the presence of exosomes. We also studied the requirements for exosomal uptake by immune cells, the role of phosphatidyl-serine (PS) as uptake signal and the effect of exosome application on tumor growth. We used exosomes from ovarian carcinoma cell lines, malignant ascites and sera from ovarian carcinoma patients isolated by ultracentrifugation. PS-displayed by exosomes was detected by Anexin-V-FITC staining of latex beads adsorbed exosomes. For uptake experiments, labeled exosomes were exposed to cells in the presence or absence of cold Annexin-V as competitor. Uptake was examined by fluorescent microscopy and cytofluorographic analysis. Effects of exosomes on tumor growth were studied using SKOV3ip ovarian carcinoma cells in CD1 nu/nu mice. We found that malignant ascites-derived exosomes cargo tumor progression related proteins such as L1CAM, CD24, ADAM10, and EMMPRIN. We observed that exosomes become systemic via the blood stream. Uptake of ovarian carcinoma exosomes by NK cells was found to require PS at the exosomal surface but the presence of PS was not sufficient. Application of malignant ascites-derived exosomes to tumor bearing mice resulted in augmented tumor growth. Exosomes from the serum of tumor patients could be isolated from only one ml of blood and this analysis could serve for diagnostic purposes. We propose that tumor-derived exosomes could play a role in tumor progression.

Retrovirology	2009	BACKGROUND: Contamination of vertebrate cell lines with animal retroviruses has been documented repeatedly before. Although such viral contaminants can be easily identified with high sensitivity by PCR, it is impossible to screen for all potential contaminants. Therefore, we explored two novel methods to identify viral contaminations in cell lines without prior knowledge of the kind of contaminant. RESULTS: The first hint for the presence of contaminating retroviruses in one of our cell lines was obtained by electron microscopy of exosome-like vesicles released from the supernatants of transfected 293T cells. Random amplification of particle associated RNAs (PAN-PCR) from supernatant of contaminated 293T cells and sequencing of the amplicons revealed several nucleotide sequences showing highest similarity to either murine leukemia virus (MuLV) or squirrel monkey retrovirus (SMRV). Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis confirmed our findings, since we could identify several peptide sequences originating from monkey and murine retroviral proteins. Quantitative PCRs were established for both viruses to test currently cultured cell lines as well as liquid nitrogen frozen cell stocks. Gene fragments for both viruses could be detected in a broad range of permissive cell lines from multiple species. Furthermore, experimental infections of cells negative for these viruses showed that both viruses replicate rapidly to high loads. We decided to further analyze the genomic sequence of the MuLV-like contaminant virus. Surprisingly it was neither identical to MuLV nor to the novel xenotropic MuLV related retrovirus (XMRV) but showed 99% identity to a synthetic retrovirus which was engineered in the 1980s. CONCLUSION: The high degree of nucleotide identity suggests unintended spread of a biosafety level 2 recombinant virus, which could also affect the risk assessment of gene-modified organisms released from contaminated cell cultures. The study further indicates that both mass spectrometry and PAN-PCR are powerful methods to identify viral contaminations in cell lines without prior knowledge of the kind of contaminant. Both methods might be useful tools for testing cell lines before using them for critical purposes.	PMC2760500

Exosomes derived from interleukin-10-treated dendritic cells can inhibit trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced rat colitis.	Scand J Gastroenterol	2010	OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which mainly refers to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Recent reports have demonstrated that exosomes derived from interleukin-10 (IL-10)-treated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) can reduce the incidence and severity of established collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. Based on the essential role of IL-10 in the development of normal mucosal immunity, we investigated whether exosomes derived from DCs treated with IL-10 (known as IL-10-exosomes) can suppress the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used the rat TNBS-induced colitis model to address the therapeutic potential of IL-10-exosomes in vivo. More specifically, a rectal enema of TNBS was administered to Wistar rats, and IL-10-exosomes were injected intraperitoneally on Day 3. RESULTS: In the context of a high level of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) and a low level of co-stimulatory molecule and membrane-bound IL-10 expression, IL-10-exosomes treatment substantially reduced all analyzed clinical, macroscopic, and histopathologic parameters of TNBS-induced colitis. The therapeutic effects of IL-10-exosomes were associated with a down-regulation mRNA expression of IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α in colon tissues. Importantly, treatment with IL-10-exosomes resulted in a pronounced up-regulation of IL-10mRNA expression in colon tissues and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in Colonic lamina propria. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that IL-10-exosomes treatment can suppress acute TNBS-induced colitis and may offer a promising new therapeutic strategy for IBD.

PLoS One	2010	αB crystallin is a chaperone protein with anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory functions and has been identified as a biomarker in age-related macular degeneration. The purpose of this study was to determine whether αB crystallin is secreted from retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, the mechanism of this secretory pathway and to determine whether extracellular αB crystallin can be taken up by adjacent retinal cells and provide protection from oxidant stress. We used human RPE cells to establish that αB crystallin is secreted by a non-classical pathway that involves exosomes. Evidence for the release of exosomes by RPE and localization of αB crystallin within the exosomes was achieved by immunoblot, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic analyses. Inhibition of lipid rafts or exosomes significantly reduced αB crystallin secretion, while inhibitors of classic secretory pathways had no effect. In highly polarized RPE monolayers, αB crystallin was selectively secreted towards the apical, photoreceptor-facing side. In support, confocal microscopy established that αB crystallin was localized predominantly in the apical compartment of RPE monolayers, where it co-localized in part with exosomal marker CD63. Severe oxidative stress resulted in barrier breakdown and release of αB crystallin to the basolateral side. In normal mouse retinal sections, αB crystallin was identified in the interphotoreceptor matrix. An increased uptake of exogenous αB crystallin and protection from apoptosis by inhibition of caspase 3 and PARP activation were observed in stressed RPE cultures. αB Crystallin was taken up by photoreceptors in mouse retinal explants exposed to oxidative stress. These results demonstrate an important role for αB crystallin in maintaining and facilitating a neuroprotective outer retinal environment and may also explain the accumulation of αB crystallin in extracellular sub-RPE deposits in the stressed microenvironment in age-related macular degeneration. Thus evidence from our studies supports a neuroprotective role for αB crystallin in ocular diseases.	PMC2951891

Gap junction-mediated import of microRNA from bone marrow stromal cells can elicit cell cycle quiescence in breast cancer cells.	Cancer Res	2011	Bone marrow (BM) metastasis of breast cancer (BC) can recur even decades after initial diagnosis and treatment, implying the long-term survival of disseminated cancer cells in a dormant state. Here we investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNA) transmitted from BM stroma to BC cells via gap junctions and exosomes in tumor cell quiescence. MDA-MB-231 and T47D BC cells arrest in G(0) phase of the cell cycle when cocultured with BM stroma. Analyses of miRNA expression profiles identified numerous miRNAs implicated in cell proliferation including miR-127, -197, -222, and -223 targeting CXCL12. Subsequently, we showed that these CXCL12-specific miRNAs are transported from BM stroma to BC cells via gap junctions, leading to reduced CXCL12 levels and decreased proliferation. Stroma-derived exosomes containing miRNAs also contributed to BC cell quiescence, although to a lesser degree than miRNAs transmitted via gap junctions. This study shows that the transfer of miRNAs from BM stroma to BC cells might play a role in the dormancy of BM metastases.

J Transl Med	2011	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are small membrane vesicles with a size of 40-100 nm that are released by different cell types from a late endosomal cellular compartment. They can be found in various body fluids including plasma, malignant ascites, urine, amniotic fluid and saliva. Exosomes contain proteins, miRNAs and mRNAs (exosome shuttle RNA, esRNA) that could serve as novel platform for diagnosis. METHOD: We isolated exosomes from amniotic fluid, saliva and urine by differential centrifugation on sucrose gradients. Marker proteins were identified by Western blot and FACS analysis after adsorption of exosomes to latex beads. We extracted esRNA from exosomes, carried out RT-PCR, and analyzed amplified products by restriction length polymorphism. RESULTS: Exosomes were positive for the marker proteins CD24, CD9, Annexin-1 and Hsp70 and displayed the correct buoyant density and orientation of antigens. In sucrose gradients the exosomal fractions contained esRNA that could be isolated with sufficient quantity for further analysis. EsRNAs were protected in exosomes from enzymatic degradation. Amniotic fluid esRNA served as template for the typing of the CD24 single nucleotide polymorphism (rs52812045). It also allowed sex determination of the fetus based on the detection of the male specific ZFY gene product. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that exosomes from body fluids carry esRNAs which can be analyzed and offers access to the transcriptome of the host organism. The exosomal lipid bilayer protects the genetic information from degradation. As the isolation of exosomes is a minimally invasive procedure, this technique opens new possibilities for diagnostics.

Exosomes from Plasmodium yoelii-infected reticulocytes protect mice from lethal infections.	PLoS One	2011	Exosomes are 30-100-nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin that are released after the fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane. While initial studies suggested that the role of exosomes was limited to the removal of proteins during the maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes, recent studies indicate that they are produced by different types of cells and are involved in promoting inter-cellular communication and antigen presentation. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of exosomes from peripheral blood of BALB/c mice infected with the reticulocyte-prone non-lethal Plasmodium yoelii 17X strain. Importantly, proteomic analysis revealed the presence of parasite proteins in these vesicles. Moreover, immunization of mice with purified exosomes elicited IgG antibodies capable of recognizing P. yoelii-infected red blood cells. Furthermore, lethal challenge of immunized mice with the normocyte-prone lethal P. yoelii 17XL strain caused a significant attenuation in the course of parasitaemia, increased survival time, and altered the cell tropism to reticulocytes. These results were obtained also when the exosomes were isolated from a P. yoelii-infected reticulocyte culture indicating that reticulocyte-derived exosomes carry antigens and are involved in immune modulation. Moreover, inclusion of CpG ODN 1826 in exosome immunizations elicited IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies and promoted survival, clearance of parasites and subsequent sterile protection of 83% of the animals challenged with P. yoelli 17XL. To our knowledge, this is the first report of immune responses elicited by exosomes derived from reticulocytes opening new avenues for the modulation of anti-malaria responses.	PMC3202549

Circulating hepatitis B surface antigen particles carry hepatocellular microRNAs.	PLoS One	2012	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) produces high quantities of subviral surface antigen particles (HBsAg) which circulate in the blood outnumbering virions of about 1\10(3-6) times. In individuals coinfected with the defective hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) the small HDV-RNA-genome and Delta antigen circulate as ribonucleoprotein complexes within HBsAg subviral particles. We addressed the question whether subviral HBsAg particles may carry in the same way cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) which are released into the bloodstream within different subcellular forms such as exosomes and microvescicles. Circulating HBsAg particles were isolated from sera of 11 HBsAg carriers by selective immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-HBs-IgG, total RNA was extracted and human miRNAs were screened by TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR Arrays. Thirty-nine human miRNAs were found to be significantly associated with the immunoprecipitated HBsAg, as determined by both comparative DDCT analysis and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney, p<0.05) with respect to controls. Moreover immunoprecipitated HBsAg particles contained Ago2 protein that could be revealed in ELISA only after 0.5% NP40. HBsAg associated miRNAs were liver-specific (most frequent = miR-27a, miR-30b, miR-122, miR-126 and miR-145) as well as immune regulatory (most frequent = miR-106b and miR-223). Computationally predicted target genes of HBsAg-associated miRNAs highlighted molecular pathways dealing with host-pathogen. The finding that HBsAg particles carry selective pools of hepatocellular miRNAs opens new avenues of research to disentangle the complex interactions between host and HBV and provides a non invasive tool to study the physiopathology of liver epigenetics.

Biochemical and biologic characterization of exosomes and microvesicles as facilitators of HIV-1 infection in macrophages.	J Immunol	2012	Exosomes and microvesicles (MV) are cell membranous sacs originating from multivesicular bodies and plasma membranes that facilitate long-distance intercellular communications. Their functional biology, however, remains incompletely understood. Macrophage exosomes and MV isolated by immunoaffinity and sucrose cushion centrifugation were characterized by morphologic, biochemical, and molecular assays. Lipidomic, proteomic, and cell biologic approaches uncovered novel processes by which exosomes and MV facilitate HIV-1 infection and dissemination. HIV-1 was "entrapped" in exosome aggregates. Robust HIV-1 replication followed infection with exosome-enhanced fractions isolated from infected cell supernatants. MV- and exosome-facilitated viral infections are affected by a range of cell surface receptors and adhesion proteins. HIV-1 containing exosomes readily completed its life cycle in human monocyte-derived macrophages but not in CD4(-) cells. The data support a significant role for exosomes as facilitators of viral infection.	PMC3786185

The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a sorting of microRNAs into exosomes in the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. In addition, microRNAs in PC-3 cells and in the non-cancerous prostate cell line RWPE-1 were compared. Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned media from PC-3 cells by ultracentrifugation and inspected by electron microscopy. Total RNA was isolated and microRNAs were analyzed by microarray analysis and real time RT-PCR. MicroRNA microarray analysis revealed that the microRNA profile of PC-3 released exosomes was similar to the profile of the corresponding parent cells. Nevertheless, a sorting of certain microRNAs into exosomes was observed, and low number microRNAs (microRNAs with a low number in their name) were found to be underrepresented in these vesicles. Moreover, the miRNA profile of PC-3 cells resembled the miRNA profile of RWPE-1 cells, though some miRNAs were found to be differently expressed in these cell lines. These results show that exosomes from PC-3 cells, in agreement with previous reports from other cell types, contain microRNAs. Furthermore, this study supports the idea that there is a sorting of microRNAs into exosomes and adds a new perspective by pointing at the underrepresentation of low number miRNAs in PC-3 released exosomes.

Gastric cancer exosomes trigger differentiation of umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts through TGF-β/Smad pathway.	PLoS One	2012	BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote tumor growth by differentiating into carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and composing the tumor microenvironment. However, the mechanisms responsible for the transition of MSCs to CAFs are not well understood. Exosomes regulate cellular activities by mediating cell-cell communication. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether cancer cell-derived exosomes were involved in regulating the differentiation of human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hucMSCs) to CAFs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We first showed that gastric cancer cell-derived exosomes induced the expression of CAF markers in hucMSCs. We then demonstrated that gastric cancer cell-derived exosomes stimulated the phosphorylation of Smad-2 in hucMSCs. We further confirmed that TGF-β receptor 1 kinase inhibitor attenuated Smad-2 phosphorylation and CAF marker expression in hucMSCs after exposure to gastric cancer cell-derived exosomes. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that gastric cancer cells triggered the differentiation of hucMSCs to CAFs by exosomes-mediated TGF-β transfer and TGF-β/Smad pathway activation, which may represent a novel mechanism for MSCs to CAFs transition in cancer.

Endometrial exosomes/microvesicles in the uterine microenvironment: a new paradigm for embryo-endometrial cross talk at implantation.	PLoS One	2013	Exosomes are nanoparticles (∼100 nm diameter) released from cells, which can transfer small RNAs and mRNA via the extracellular environment to cells at distant sites. We hypothesised that exosomes or the slightly larger microvesicles (100-300 nm) are released from the endometrial epithelium into the uterine cavity, and that these contain specific micro (mi)RNA that could be transferred to either the trophectodermal cells of the blastocyst or to endometrial epithelial cells, to promote implantation. The aim of this study was to specifically identify and characterise exosomes/microvesicles (mv) released from endometrial epithelial cells and to determine whether exosomes/mv are present in uterine fluid. Immunostaining demonstrated that the tetraspanins, CD9 and CD63 used as cell surface markers of exosomes are present on the apical surfaces of endometrial epithelial cells in tissue sections taken across the menstrual cycle: CD63 showed cyclical regulation. Exosome/mv pellets were prepared from culture medium of endometrial epithelial cell (ECC1 cells) and from uterine fluid and its associated mucus by sequential ultracentifugation. Exosomes/mv were positively identified in all preparations by FACS and immunofluorescence staining following exosome binding to beads. Size particle analysis confirmed the predominance of particles of 50-150 nm in each of these fluids. MiRNA analysis of the ECC1 cells and their exosomes/mv demonstrated sorting of miRNA into exosomes/mv: 13 of the 227 miRNA were specific to exosomes/mv, while a further 5 were not present in these. The most abundant miRNA in exosomes/mv were hsa-miR-200c, hsa-miR-17 and hsa-miR-106a. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the exosome/mv-specific miRNAs have potential targets in biological pathways highly relevant for embryo implantation. Thus exosomes/mv containing specific miRNA are present in the microenvironment in which embryo implantation occurs and may contribute to the endometrial-embryo cross talk essential for this process.

Exosomes with membrane-associated TGF-β1 from gene-modified dendritic cells inhibit murine EAE independently of MHC restriction.	Eur J Immunol	2013	We have previously demonstrated that exosomes from dendritic cells (DCs) secreting TGF-β1 (sTGF-β1-EXOs) delay the development of murine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, we isolated exosomes from DCs expressing membrane-associated TGF-β1 (mTGF-β1-EXOs) and found mTGF-β1-EXOs had more potent immunosuppressive activity than sTGF-β1-EXOs in vitro. Treatment of mice with mTGF-β1-EXOs inhibited the development and progression of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide-induced EAE even after disease onset. Treatment of mice with mTGF-β1-EXOs also impaired Ag-specific Th1 and IL-17 responses, but promoted IL-10 responses ex vivo. Treatment with mTGF-β1-EXOs decreased the frequency of Th17 cells in EAE mice, which might be associated with the down-regulation of the p38, ERK, Stat3, and NF-κB activation and IL-6 expression in DCs. Treatment with mTGF-β1-EXOs maintained the regulatory capacity of Treg cells, and adoptive transfer of CD4(+)Foxp3(+)Treg cells from mTGF-β1-EXO-treated EAE mice dramatically prevented the development of EAE in the recipients. Moreover, treatment with mTGF-β1-EXOs from C57BL/6 mice effectively prevented and inhibited proteolipid protein (PLP) peptide-induced EAE in BALB/c mice. These results indicate that mTGF-β1-EXOs possess powerful immunosuppressive ability and can effectively inhibit the development and progression of EAE in different strains of mice.

Natural CD8⁺25⁺ regulatory T cell-secreted exosomes capable of suppressing cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated immunity against B16 melanoma.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2013	Natural CD4(+)25(+) and CD8(+)25(+) regulatory T (Tr) cells have been shown to inhibit autoimmune diseases. Immune cells secrete exosomes (EXOs), which are crucial for immune regulation. However, immunomodulatory effect of natural Tr cell-secreted EXOs is unknown. In this study, we purified natural CD8(+)25(+) Tr cells from C57BL/6 mouse naive CD8(+) T cells, and in vitro amplified them with CD3/CD28 beads. EXOs (EXO(Tr)) were purified from Tr cell's culture supernatants by differential ultracentrifugation and analyzed by electron microscopy, Western blot and flow cytometry. Our data showed that EXO(Tr) had a "saucer" or round shape with 50-100 nm in diameter, contained EXO-associated markers LAMP-1 and CD9, and expressed natural Tr cell markers CD25 and GITR. To assess immunomodulatory effect, we i.v. immunized C57BL/6 mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-pulsed DCs (DC(OVA)) plus Tr cells or EXO(Tr), and then assessed OVA-specific CD8(+) T cell responses using PE-H-2K(b)/OVA tetramer and FITC-anti-CD8 antibody staining by flow cytometry and antitumor immunity in immunized mice with challenge of OVA-expressing BL6-10OVA melanoma cells. We demonstrated that DC(OVA)-stimulated CD8(+) T cell responses and protective antitumor immunity significantly dropped from 2.52% to 1.08% and 1.81% (p<0.05), and from 8/8 to 2/8 and 5/8 mice DC(OVA) (p<0.05) in immunized mice with co-injection of Tr cells and EXO(Tr), respectively. Our results indicate that natural CD8(+)25(+) Tr cell-released EXOs, alike CD8(+)25(+) Tr cells, can inhibit CD8(+) T cell responses and antitumor immunity. Therefore, EXOs derived from natural CD4(+)25(+) and CD8(+)25(+) Tr cells may become an alternative for immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases.

MicroRNA and protein profiling of brain metastasis competent cell-derived exosomes.	PLoS One	2013	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles released by most cell types including tumor cells. The intercellular exchange of proteins and genetic material via exosomes is a potentially effective approach for cell-to-cell communication and it may perform multiple functions aiding to tumor survival and metastasis. We investigated microRNA and protein profiles of brain metastatic (BM) versus non-brain metastatic (non-BM) cell-derived exosomes. We studied the cargo of exosomes isolated from brain-tropic 70W, MDA-MB-231BR, and circulating tumor cell brain metastasis-selected markers (CTC1BMSM) variants, and compared them with parental non-BM MeWo, MDA-MB-231P and CTC1P cells, respectively. By performing microRNA PCR array we identified one up-regulated (miR-210) and two down-regulated miRNAs (miR-19a and miR-29c) in BM versus non-BM exosomes. Second, we analyzed the proteomic content of cells and exosomes isolated from these six cell lines, and detected high expression of proteins implicated in cell communication, cell cycle, and in key cancer invasion and metastasis pathways. Third, we show that BM cell-derived exosomes can be internalized by non-BM cells and that they effectively transport their cargo into cells, resulting in increased cell adhesive and invasive potencies. These results provide a strong rationale for additional investigations of exosomal proteins and miRNAs towards more profound understandings of exosome roles in brain metastasis biogenesis, and for the discovery and application of non-invasive biomarkers for new therapies combating brain metastasis.

Subfractionation, characterization, and in-depth proteomic analysis of glomerular membrane vesicles in human urine.	Kidney Int	2014	Urinary exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) are a heterogenous mixture (diameter 40-200 nm) containing vesicles shed from all segments of the nephron including glomerular podocytes. Contamination with Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) oligomers has hampered their isolation and proteomic analysis. Here we improved ELV isolation protocols employing density centrifugation to remove THP and albumin, and isolated a glomerular membranous vesicle (GMV)-enriched subfraction from 7 individuals identifying 1830 proteins and in 3 patients with glomerular disease identifying 5657 unique proteins. The GMV fraction was composed of podocin/podocalyxin-positive irregularly shaped membranous vesicles and podocin/podocalyxin-negative classical exosomes. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified integrin, actin cytoskeleton, and Rho GDI signaling in the top three canonical represented signaling pathways and 19 other proteins associated with inherited glomerular diseases. The GMVs are of podocyte origin and the density gradient technique allowed isolation in a reproducible manner. We show many nephrotic syndrome proteins, proteases, and complement proteins involved in glomerular disease are in GMVs and some were only shed in the disease state (nephrin, TRPC6, INF2 and phospholipase A2 receptor). We calculated sample sizes required to identify new glomerular disease biomarkers, expand the ELV proteome, and provide a reference proteome in a database that may prove useful in the search for biomarkers of glomerular disease.

Electronic address: .	jgillette@salud.unm.edu		Measurement of intercellular transfer to signaling endosomes.	Methods Enzymol	2014	Cell-cell communication is essential for an abundance of physiological processes. As such, various mechanisms have evolved to regulate and ensure proper cell-to-cell signaling. Recently, a novel mechanism of cell communication has emerged which involves the physical transfer of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells. Following this process termed intercellular transfer (ICT), the transferred molecules can signal within recipient cells by entering the endosomal system and trafficking to signaling endosomes. Signaling endosomes can modulate signal localization within the cell as well as the specificity of, and cross talk between, signaling pathways. As such, ICT into signaling endosomes has the potential to modify the signaling profile of the recipient cell. In this chapter, we describe the different methods of ICT as well as how transfer to signaling endosomes can be visualized and quantified.

Transl Oncol	2013	Exosomes are nanometer-sized lipid vesicles released ubiquitously by cells, which have been shown to have a normal physiological role, as well as influence the tumor microenvironment and aid metastasis. Recent studies highlight the ability of exosomes to convey tumor-suppressive and oncogenic mRNAs, microRNAs, and proteins to a receiving cell, subsequently activating downstream signaling pathways and influencing cellular phenotype. Here, we show that radiation increases the abundance of exosomes released by glioblastoma cells and normal astrocytes. Exosomes derived from irradiated cells enhanced the migration of recipient cells, and their molecular profiling revealed an abundance of molecules related to signaling pathways important for cell migration. In particular, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mRNA and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) protein levels were elevated, and coculture of nonirradiated cells with exosomes isolated from irradiated cells increased CTGF protein expression in the recipient cells. Additionally, these exosomes enhanced the activation of neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (TrkA), focal adhesion kinase, Paxillin, and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (Src) in recipient cells, molecules involved in cell migration. Collectively, our data suggest that radiation influences exosome abundance, specifically alters their molecular composition, and on uptake, promotes a migratory phenotype.	PMC3890698

Exosomal HIF1α supports invasive potential of nasopharyngeal carcinoma-associated LMP1-positive exosomes.	Oncogene	2014	It has emerged recently that exosomes are potential carriers of pro-tumorigenic factors that participate in oncogenesis. However, whether oncogenic transcription factors are transduced by exosomes is unknown. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) transcriptionally regulates numerous key aspects of tumor development and progression by promoting a more aggressive tumor phenotype, characterized by increased proliferation and invasiveness coupled with neoangiogenesis. It has been shown that the principal oncoprotein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), drives oncogenic processes and tumor progression of the highly invasive EBV malignancy, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We now demonstrate that endogenous HIF1α is detectable in exosomes and that LMP1 significantly increases levels of HIF1α in exosomes. HIF1 recovered from exosomes retains DNA-binding activity and is transcriptionally active in recipient cells after exosome uptake. We also show that treatment of EBV-negative cells with LMP1-exosomes increases migration and invasiveness of NP cell lines in functional assays, which correlates with the phenotype associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, we provide evidence that HIF1α itself participates in exosome-mediated pro-metastatic effects in recipient cells, as exosome-mediated delivery of active and inactive forms of HIF1α results in reciprocal changes in the expression of E- and N-cadherins associated with EMT. Further, immunohistochemical analysis of NPC tumor tissues revealed direct correlation between protein levels of LMP1 and of the endosome/exosome marker tetraspanin, CD63, which suggests an increase in exosome formation in this EBV-positive malignancy. We hypothesize that exosome-mediated transfer of functional pro-metastatic factors by LMP1-positive NPC cells to surrounding tumor cells promotes cancer progression.	PMC4162459

Low-dose cytokine-induced neutral ceramidase secretion from INS-1 cells via exosomes and its anti-apoptotic effect.	FEBS J	2014	It has been reported that the effect of inflammatory cytokines on β-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes is concentration-dependent. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we found that a high concentration of cytokines promoted apoptosis in the rat β-cell line INS-1, whereas a low concentration of cytokines had no effect. We also found that cytokines at a low concentration stimulated neutral ceramidase (NCDase) release via exosomes from INS-1 cells, whereas cytokines at a high concentration inhibited NCDase release. Furthermore, the results showed that the NCDase-containing exosomes isolated from the culture medium of INS-1 cells treated with cytokines at a low concentration inhibited apoptosis induced by a high concentration of cytokines. Finally, the results also showed that the protective action of NCDase in the exosomes on apoptosis was mediated by the generation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its interaction with S1P receptor 2. Taken together, these findings revealed a novel NCDase-S1P-phosphate-S1P receptor 2-dependent mechanism by which a low level of inflammatory cytokines protects pancreatic β-cells from apoptosis induced by a high level of inflammatory cytokines.

SNX31: a novel sorting nexin associated with the uroplakin-degrading multivesicular bodies in terminally differentiated urothelial cells.	PLoS One	2014	Uroplakins (UP), a group of integral membrane proteins, are major urothelial differentiation products that form 2D crystals of 16-nm particles (urothelial plaques) covering the apical surface of mammalian bladder urothelium. They contribute to the urothelial barrier function and, one of them, UPIa, serves as the receptor for uropathogenic Escherichia coli. It is therefore important to understand the mechanism by which these surface-associated uroplakins are degraded. While it is known that endocytosed uroplakin plaques are targeted to and line the multivesicular bodies (MVBs), it is unclear how these rigid-looking plaques can go to the highly curved membranes of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). From a cDNA subtraction library, we identified a highly urothelium-specific sorting nexin, SNX31. SNX31 is expressed, like uroplakins, in terminally differentiated urothelial umbrella cells where it is predominantly associated with MVBs. Apical membrane proteins including uroplakins that are surface biotin-tagged are endocytosed and targeted to the SNX31-positive MVBs. EM localization demonstrated that SNX31 and uroplakins are both associated not only with the limiting membranes of MVBs containing uroplakin plaques, but also with ILVs. SNX31 can bind, on one hand, the PtdIns3P-enriched lipids via its N-terminal PX-domain, and, on the other hand, it binds uroplakins as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay, and by its reduced membrane association in uroplakin II-deficient urothelium. The fact that in urothelial umbrella cells MVBs are the only major intracellular organelles enriched in both PtdIns3P and uroplakins may explain SNX31's MVB-specificity in these cells. However, in MDCK and other cultured cells transfected SNX31 can bind to early endosomes possibly via lipids. These data support a model in which SNX31 mediates the endocytic degradation of uroplakins by disassembling/collapsing the MVB-associated uroplakin plaques, thus enabling the uroplakin-containing (but 'softened') membranes to bud and form the ILVs for lysosomal degradation and/or exosome formation.

Cardiovasc Res	2014	AIMS: Recent evidence suggests that cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) may improve cardiac function after injury. The underlying mechanisms are indirect, but their mediators remain unidentified. Exosomes and other secreted membrane vesicles, hereafter collectively referred to as extracellular vesicles (EVs), act as paracrine signalling mediators. Here, we report that EVs secreted by human CPCs are crucial cardioprotective agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: CPCs were derived from atrial appendage explants from patients who underwent heart valve surgery. CPC-conditioned medium (CM) inhibited apoptosis in mouse HL-1 cardiomyocytic cells, while enhancing tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These effects were abrogated by depleting CM of EVs. They were reproduced by EVs secreted by CPCs, but not by those secreted by human dermal fibroblasts. Transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis showed most EVs to be 30-90 nm in diameter, the size of exosomes, although smaller and larger vesicles were also present. MicroRNAs most highly enriched in EVs secreted by CPCs compared with fibroblasts included miR-210, miR-132, and miR-146a-3p. miR-210 down-regulated its known targets, ephrin A3 and PTP1b, inhibiting apoptosis in cardiomyocytic cells. miR-132 down-regulated its target, RasGAP-p120, enhancing tube formation in endothelial cells. Infarcted hearts injected with EVs from CPCs, but not from fibroblasts, exhibited less cardiomyocyte apoptosis, enhanced angiogenesis, and improved LV ejection fraction (0.8 ± 6.8 vs. -21.3 ± 4.5%; P < 0.05) compared with those injected with control medium. CONCLUSION: EVs are the active component of the paracrine secretion by human CPCs. As a cell-free approach, EVs could circumvent many of the limitations of cell transplantation.

Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci	2014	Exosomes are small membranous vesicles of endocytic origin that are released by almost every cell type. They exert versatile functions in intercellular communication important for many physiological and pathological processes. Recently, exosomes attracted interest with regard to their role in cell-cell communication in the nervous system. We have shown that exosomes released from oligodendrocytes upon stimulation with the neurotransmitter glutamate are internalized by neurons and enhance the neuronal stress tolerance. Here, we demonstrate that oligodendroglial exosomes also promote neuronal survival during oxygen-glucose deprivation, a model of cerebral ischaemia. We show the transfer from oligodendrocytes to neurons of superoxide dismutase and catalase, enzymes which are known to help cells to resist oxidative stress. Additionally, we identify various effects of oligodendroglial exosomes on neuronal physiology. Electrophysiological analysis using in vitro multi-electrode arrays revealed an increased firing rate of neurons exposed to oligodendroglial exosomes. Moreover, gene expression analysis and phosphorylation arrays uncovered differentially expressed genes and altered signal transduction pathways in neurons after exosome treatment. Our study thus provides new insight into the broad spectrum of action of oligodendroglial exosomes and their effects on neuronal physiology. The exchange of extracellular vesicles between neural cells may exhibit remarkable potential to impact brain performance.	PMC4142031

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2014	Exosomes have been proposed as vehicles for microRNA (miRNA) -based intercellular communication and a source of miRNA biomarkers in bodily fluids. Although exosome preparations contain miRNAs, a quantitative analysis of their abundance and stoichiometry is lacking. In the course of studying cancer-associated extracellular miRNAs in patient blood samples, we found that exosome fractions contained a small minority of the miRNA content of plasma. This low yield prompted us to perform a more quantitative assessment of the relationship between miRNAs and exosomes using a stoichiometric approach. We quantified both the number of exosomes and the number of miRNA molecules in replicate samples that were isolated from five diverse sources (i.e., plasma, seminal fluid, dendritic cells, mast cells, and ovarian cancer cells). Regardless of the source, on average, there was far less than one molecule of a given miRNA per exosome, even for the most abundant miRNAs in exosome preparations (mean ± SD across six exosome sources: 0.00825 ± 0.02 miRNA molecules/exosome). Thus, if miRNAs were distributed homogenously across the exosome population, on average, over 100 exosomes would need to be examined to observe one copy of a given abundant miRNA. This stoichiometry of miRNAs and exosomes suggests that most individual exosomes in standard preparations do not carry biologically significant numbers of miRNAs and are, therefore, individually unlikely to be functional as vehicles for miRNA-based communication. We propose revised models to reconcile the exosome-mediated, miRNA-based intercellular communication hypothesis with the observed stoichiometry of miRNAs associated with exosomes.	PMC4205618

Cerebrospinal fluid extracellular vesicles undergo age dependent declines and contain known and novel non-coding RNAs.	PLoS One	2014	Brain development requires precise orchestration of cellular events through the coordinate exchange of information between distally located cells. One mechanism by which intercellular communication is achieved is through the transfer of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Exosomes are EVs that carry lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins and are detectable in most biological fluids including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here we report that CSF EV concentrations undergo age dependent fluctuations. We characterized EV RNA content by next generation small RNA sequencing and miRNA microarray analysis and identified a temporal shift in CSF EV content. CSF EVs encapsulated miRNAs that contain a conserved hnRNPA2/B1 recognition sequence. We found that hnRNPA2/B1-containing EVs were produced by choroid plexus epithelial cells and that hnRNPA2/B1 containing EVs decreased with age. These results provide insight into EV exchange of miRNAs within the central nervous system and a framework to understand how changes in EVs may have an important impact on brain development.

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	The contributions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to tumour growth and stroma formation are poorly understood. Tumour cells can transfer genetic information and modulate cell signalling in other cells through the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs). We examined the contribution of EV-mediated inter-cellular signalling between bone marrow MSCs and tumour cells in human cholangiocarcinoma, highly desmoplastic cancers that are characterized by tumour cells closely intertwined within a dense fibrous stroma. Exposure of MSCs to tumour cell-derived EVs enhanced MSC migratory capability and expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin mRNA, in addition to mRNA expression and release of CXCL-1, CCL2 and IL-6. Conditioned media from MSCs exposed to tumour cell-derived EVs increased STAT-3 phosphorylation and proliferation in tumour cells. These effects were completely blocked by anti-IL-6R antibody. In conclusion, tumour cell-derived EVs can contribute to the generation of tumour stroma through fibroblastic differentiation of MSCs, and can also selectively modulate the cellular release of soluble factors such as IL-6 by MSCs that can, in turn, alter tumour cell proliferation. Thus, malignant cells can "educate" MSCs to induce local microenvironmental changes that enhance tumour cell growth.	PMC4283029

Heparanase activates the syndecan-syntenin-ALIX exosome pathway.	Cell Res	2015	Exosomes are secreted vesicles of endosomal origin involved in signaling processes. We recently showed that the syndecan heparan sulfate proteoglycans control the biogenesis of exosomes through their interaction with syntenin-1 and the endosomal-sorting complex required for transport accessory component ALIX. Here we investigated the role of heparanase, the only mammalian enzyme able to cleave heparan sulfate internally, in the syndecan-syntenin-ALIX exosome biogenesis pathway. We show that heparanase stimulates the exosomal secretion of syntenin-1, syndecan and certain other exosomal cargo, such as CD63, in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, exosomal CD9, CD81 and flotillin-1 are not affected. Conversely, reduction of endogenous heparanase reduces the secretion of syntenin-1-containing exosomes. The ability of heparanase to stimulate exosome production depends on syntenin-1 and ALIX. Syndecans, but not glypicans, support exosome biogenesis in heparanase-exposed cells. Finally, heparanase stimulates intraluminal budding of syndecan and syntenin-1 in endosomes, depending on the syntenin-ALIX interaction. Taken together, our findings identify heparanase as a modulator of the syndecan-syntenin-ALIX pathway, fostering endosomal membrane budding and the biogenesis of exosomes by trimming the heparan sulfate chains on syndecans. In addition, our data suggest that this mechanism controls the selection of specific cargo to exosomes.	PMC4387558

Electronic address: .	richard.simpson@latrobe.edu.au		Highly-purified exosomes and shed microvesicles isolated from the human colon cancer cell line LIM1863 by sequential centrifugal ultrafiltration are biochemically and functionally distinct.	Methods	2015	Secretion and exchange of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by most cell types is emerging as a fundamental biological process. Although much is known about EVs, there is still a lack of definition as to how many naturally occurring EV subtypes there are and how their properties and functionalities might differ. This vexing issue is critical if EVs are to be fully harnessed for therapeutic applications. To address this question we have developed and describe here a sequential centrifugal ultrafiltration (SCUF) method to examine, in an unbiased manner, what EV subtypes are released in vitro into cell culture medium using the human colon carcinoma cell line LIM1863 as a model system. Using the culture medium from ∼7.2×10(9) LIM1863 cells, SCUF was performed using hydrophilic PVDF membranes with low protein binding properties (Millipore Durapore™ Ultrafree-CL filters with 0.1, 0.22, 0.45 and 0.65 μm pore size). EV particle sizing was measured using both dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy. Comparative proteome profiling was performed by GeLC-MS/MS and qualitative protein differences between EV subtypes determined by label-free spectral counting. The results showed essentially two EV subtypes; one subtype (fraction Fn1) comprised heterogeneous EVs with particle diameters of 30-1300 nm, the other (fraction Fn5) being homogeneous EVs of 30-100 nm diameter; based on cryo-EM both EV subtypes were round shaped. Western blot analysis showed Fn5 (SCUF-Exos) contained traditional exosome marker proteins (Alix(+), TSG101(+), CD81(+), CD63(+)), while Fn1 (SCUF-sMVs) lacked these protein markers. These findings were consistent with sMVs isolated by differential centrifugation (10,000 g, DC-sMVs) and exosomes (100,000 g EVs depleted of 10,000 g material). The buoyant density of sMVs determined by OptiPrep™ density gradient centrifugation was 1.18-1.19 g/mL and exosomes 1.10-1.11 g/mL. Comparative protein profiling of SCUF-Exos/-sMVs revealed 354 and 606 unambiguous protein identifications, respectively, with 256 proteins in common. A salient finding was the first report of 350 proteins uniquely identified in sMVs may of which have the potential to enable discrimination of this EV subtype from exosomes (notably, members of the septin family, kinesin-like protein (KIF23), exportin-2/chromosome segregation like-1 protein (CSE1L), and Rac GTPase-activating protein 1 (RACGAP1)). We report for the first time that both SCUF-Exos and SCUF-sMVs isolated from LIM1863 colon cancer cells induce invasion of recipient NIH3T3 cells. Interestingly, the SCUF-sMVs promote invasion to a significantly greater extent (3-fold) than SCUF-Exos. This analytical SCUF method for fractionating EVs is potentially scalable using tangential flow filtration, thereby providing a solid foundation for future in-depth functional studies of EV subtypes using diverse cell types and functional assays.

Circulating microRNAs Reveal Time Course of Organ Injury in a Porcine Model of Acetaminophen-Induced Acute Liver Failure.	PLoS One	2015	Acute liver failure is a rare but catastrophic condition which can progress rapidly to multi-organ failure. Studies investigating the onset of individual organ injury such as the liver, kidneys and brain during the evolution of acute liver failure, are lacking. MicroRNAs are short, non-coding strands of RNA that are released into the circulation following tissue injury. In this study, we have characterised the release of both global microRNA and specific microRNA species into the plasma using a porcine model of acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure. Pigs were induced to acute liver failure with oral acetaminophen over 19h±2h and death occurred 13h±3h thereafter. Global microRNA concentrations increased 4h prior to acute liver failure in plasma (P<0.0001) but not in isolated exosomes, and were associated with increasing plasma levels of the damage-associated molecular pattern molecule, genomic DNA (P<0.0001). MiR122 increased around the time of onset of acute liver failure (P<0.0001) and was associated with increasing international normalised ratio (P<0.0001). MiR192 increased 8h after acute liver failure (P<0.0001) and was associated with increasing creatinine (P<0.0001). The increase in miR124-1 occurred concurrent with the pre-terminal increase in intracranial pressure (P<0.0001) and was associated with decreasing cerebral perfusion pressure (P<0.002). Conclusions: MicroRNAs were released passively into the circulation in response to acetaminophen-induced cellular damage. A significant increase in global microRNA was detectable prior to significant increases in miR122, miR192 and miR124-1, which were associated with clinical evidence of liver, kidney and brain injury respectively.

Exosomes released by keratinocytes modulate melanocyte pigmentation.	Nat Commun	2015	Cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosomes and microvesicles, which transfer proteins, lipids and RNAs to regulate recipient cell functions. Skin pigmentation relies on a tight dialogue between keratinocytes and melanocytes in the epidermis. Here we report that exosomes secreted by keratinocytes enhance melanin synthesis by increasing both the expression and activity of melanosomal proteins. Furthermore, we show that the function of keratinocyte-derived exosomes is phototype-dependent and is modulated by ultraviolet B. In sum, this study uncovers an important physiological function for exosomes in human pigmentation and opens new avenues in our understanding of how pigmentation is regulated by intercellular communication in both healthy and diseased states.

Tumour Biol	2016	Exosomes are extracellularly secreted vesicles ranging from 40 to 100 nm in diameter that are thought to play important roles in intercellular communication. Exosomes contain numerous proteins, RNA, and lipids that can affect the status of recipient cells under various pathological conditions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a major role in post-transcriptional gene silencing by interacting with the 3'-untranslated regions of target genes. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been reported to induce sustained elevation of cellular miRNAs such as miR-155. We hypothesized that miRNAs delivered by exosomes might affect the angiogenesis of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Here, we demonstrated that co-culture of EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells (Raji) with retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells increased the level of miR-155 in recipient cells whereas no major difference was detected for co-culture with EBV-negative BL cells (Ramos). Isolated Raji exosomes increased transcriptional and translational levels of VEGF-A in ARPE-19 cells, which was reversely correlated with von Hippel-Lindau expression. A human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assay showed that delivery of ectopic miR-155 rendered ARPE-19 cells proangiogenic. Our results demonstrate that sustained accumulation of miR-155 mediated by exosomes might affect remote recipient cells such as retinal pigment epithelial cells.

Carcinogenic activity of PbS quantum dots screened using exosomal biomarkers secreted from HEK293 cells.	Int J Nanomedicine	2015	Lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) have been applied in the biomedical area because they offer an excellent platform for theragnostic applications. In order to comprehensively evaluate the biocompatibility of PbS QDs in human cells, we analyzed the exosomes secreted from cells because exosomes are released during cellular stress to convey signals to other cells and serve as a reservoir of enriched biomarkers. PbS QDs were synthesized and coated with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) to allow the particles to disperse in water. Exosomes were isolated from HEK293 cells treated with PbS-MPA at concentrations of 0 µg/mL, 5 µg/mL, and 50 µg/mL, and the exosomal expression levels of miRNAs and proteins were analyzed. As a result, five miRNAs and two proteins were proposed as specific exosomal biomarkers for the exposure of HEK293 cells to PbS-MPA. Based on the pathway analysis, the molecular signature of the exosomes suggested that PbS-MPA QDs had carcinogenic activity. The comet assay and expression of molecular markers, such as p53, interleukin (IL)-8, and C-X-C motif chemokine 5, indicated that DNA damage occurred in HEK293 cells following PbS-MPA exposure, which supported the carcinogenic activity of the particles. In addition, there was obvious intensification of miRNA expression signals in the exosomes compared with that of the parent cells, which suggested that exosomal biomarkers could be detected more sensitively than those of whole cellular extracts.

Microenvironment-induced PTEN loss by exosomal microRNA primes brain metastasis outgrowth.	Nature	2015	The development of life-threatening cancer metastases at distant organs requires disseminated tumour cells' adaptation to, and co-evolution with, the drastically different microenvironments of metastatic sites. Cancer cells of common origin manifest distinct gene expression patterns after metastasizing to different organs. Clearly, the dynamic interaction between metastatic tumour cells and extrinsic signals at individual metastatic organ sites critically effects the subsequent metastatic outgrowth. Yet, it is unclear when and how disseminated tumour cells acquire the essential traits from the microenvironment of metastatic organs that prime their subsequent outgrowth. Here we show that both human and mouse tumour cells with normal expression of PTEN, an important tumour suppressor, lose PTEN expression after dissemination to the brain, but not to other organs. The PTEN level in PTEN-loss brain metastatic tumour cells is restored after leaving the brain microenvironment. This brain microenvironment-dependent, reversible PTEN messenger RNA and protein downregulation is epigenetically regulated by microRNAs from brain astrocytes. Mechanistically, astrocyte-derived exosomes mediate an intercellular transfer of PTEN-targeting microRNAs to metastatic tumour cells, while astrocyte-specific depletion of PTEN-targeting microRNAs or blockade of astrocyte exosome secretion rescues the PTEN loss and suppresses brain metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, this adaptive PTEN loss in brain metastatic tumour cells leads to an increased secretion of the chemokine CCL2, which recruits IBA1-expressing myeloid cells that reciprocally enhance the outgrowth of brain metastatic tumour cells via enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate a remarkable plasticity of PTEN expression in metastatic tumour cells in response to different organ microenvironments, underpinning an essential role of co-evolution between the metastatic cells and their microenvironment during the adaptive metastatic outgrowth. Our findings signify the dynamic and reciprocal cross-talk between tumour cells and the metastatic niche; importantly, they provide new opportunities for effective anti-metastasis therapies, especially of consequence for brain metastasis patients.

Fourteen years after the discovery of miRNAs, there was another revolutionary finding: cells can shuttle miRNAs between each other via small lipid bilayer vesicles called exosomes. This exosome-mediated horizontal transfer of genetically encoded messages is now recognized as a means of intercellular communication.

J Clin Med	2015	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 22-25 nucleotide RNAs that control gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. MiRNAs have potential as cancer biomarkers. Melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer accounting for almost 4% of cancers among men and women, and ~80% of skin cancer-related deaths in the US. In the present study we analyzed plasma-derived exosomal miRNAs from clinically affected and unaffected familial melanoma patients (CDKN2A/p16 gene carriers) and compared them with affected (nonfamilial melanoma) and unaffected control subjects in order to identify novel risk biomarkers for melanoma. Intact miRNAs can be isolated from the circulation because of their presence in exosomes. A number of differentially regulated miRNAs identified by NanoString human V2 miRNA array were validated by quantitative PCR. Significantly, miR-17, miR-19a, miR-21, miR-126, and miR-149 were expressed at higher levels in patients with metastatic sporadic melanoma as compared with familial melanoma patients or unaffected control subjects. Surprisingly, no substantial differences in miRNA expression were detected between familial melanoma patients (all inclusive) and unaffected control subjects. The miRNAs differentially expressed in the different patient cohorts, especially in patients with metastatic melanoma, may play important roles in tumor progression and metastasis, and may be used as predictive biomarkers to monitor remission as well as relapse following therapeutic intervention.

Cytotherapy	2016	BACKGROUND AIMS: Exosomes, a key component of cell paracrine secretion, can exert protective effects in various disease models. However, application of exosomes in vascular repair and regeneration has rarely been reported. In this study, we tested whether endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-derived exosomes possessed therapeutic effects in rat models of balloon-induced vascular injury by accelerating reendothelialization. METHODS: Exosomes were obtained from the conditioned media of EPCs isolated from human umbilical cord blood. Induction of the endothelial injury was performed in the rats' carotid artery, and the pro-re-endothelialization capacity of EPC-derived exosomes was measured. The in vitro effects of exosomes on the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells were investigated. RESULTS: We found that the EPC-derived exosomes accelerated the re-endothelialization in the early phase after endothelial damage in the rat carotid artery. We also demonstrated that these exosomes enhanced the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in vitro. Moreover, endothelial cells stimulated with these exosomes showed increased expression of angiogenesis-related molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate that exosomes are an active component of the paracrine secretion of human EPCs and can promote vascular repair in rat models of balloon injury by up-regulating endothelial cells function.

Electronic address: .	dcantonwine@partners.org		Evaluation of proteomic biomarkers associated with circulating microparticles as an effective means to stratify the risk of spontaneous preterm birth.	Am J Obstet Gynecol	2016	BACKGROUND: The analysis of circulating microparticles in pregnancy is of revolutionary potential because it represents an in vivo biopsy of active gestational tissues. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that circulating microparticle signaling will differ in pregnancies that experience spontaneous preterm birth from those delivering at term and that these differences will be evident many weeks in advance of clinical presentation. STUDY DESIGN: Utilizing plasma specimens obtained between 10 and 12 weeks' gestation as part of a prospectively collected birth cohort in which pregnancy outcomes are independently validated by 2 board-certified maternal-fetal medicine physicians, 25 singleton cases of spontaneous preterm birth ≤ 34 weeks were matched by maternal age, race, and gestational age of sampling (±2 weeks) with 50 uncomplicated term deliveries. Circulating microparticles from these first-trimester specimens were isolated and analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry for potential protein biomarkers following previous studies. Markers with robust univariate performance in correlating spontaneous preterm birth were further evaluated for their biological relevance via a combined functional profiling/pathway analysis and for multivariate performance. RESULTS: Among the 132 proteins evaluated, 62 demonstrated robust power of detecting spontaneous preterm birth in a bootstrap receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis at a false discovery rate of < 20% estimated via label permutation. Differential dependency network analysis identified spontaneous preterm birth-associated coexpression patterns linked to biological processes of inflammation, wound healing, and the coagulation cascade. Linear modeling of spontaneous preterm birth using a multiplex of the candidate biomarkers with a fixed sensitivity of 80% exhibited a specificity of 83% with median area under the curve of 0.89. These results indicate a strong potential of multivariate model development for informative risk stratification. CONCLUSION: This project has identified functional proteomic factors with associated biological processes that are already unique in their expression profiles at 10-12 weeks among women who go on to deliver spontaneously ≤ 34 weeks. These changes, with further validation, will allow the stratification of patients at risk of spontaneous preterm birth before clinical presentation.	PMC4851565

J Extracell Vesicles	2016	BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are attractive candidate drug delivery systems due to their ability to functionally transport biological cargo to recipient cells. However, the apparent lack of target cell specificity of exogenously administered EVs limits their therapeutic applicability. In this study, we propose a novel method to equip EVs with targeting properties, in order to improve their interaction with tumour cells. METHODS: EV producing cells were transfected with vectors encoding for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) nanobodies, which served as targeting ligands for tumour cells, fused to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor signal peptides derived from decay-accelerating factor (DAF). EVs were isolated using ultrafiltration/size-exclusion liquid chromatography and characterized using western blotting, Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, and electron microscopy. EV-tumour cell interactions were analyzed under static conditions using flow cytometry and under flow conditions using a live-cell fluorescence microscopy-coupled perfusion system. RESULTS: EV analysis showed that GPI-linked nanobodies were successfully displayed on EV surfaces and were highly enriched in EVs compared with parent cells. Display of GPI-linked nanobodies on EVs did not alter general EV characteristics (i.e. morphology, size distribution and protein marker expression), but greatly improved EV binding to tumour cells dependent on EGFR density under static conditions. Moreover, nanobody-displaying EVs showed a significantly improved cell association to EGFR-expressing tumour cells under flow conditions. CONCLUSIONS: We show that nanobodies can be anchored on the surface of EVs via GPI, which alters their cell targeting behaviour. Furthermore, this study highlights GPI-anchoring as a new tool in the EV toolbox, which may be applied for EV display of a variety of proteins, such as antibodies, reporter proteins and signaling molecules.

Human macrophages induce CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells via binding and re-release of TGF-β.	Immunol Cell Biol	2016	While pro-inflammatory immune responses are a requirement to combat microbes, uncontrolled self-directed inflammatory immune responses are the hallmark of autoimmune diseases. Restoration of immunological tolerance involves both suppression of ongoing tissue-destructive immune responses and re-education of the host immune system. Both functionally immunosuppressive macrophages (M2) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are implicated in these processes. Their mutual interaction is synergistic in this context and adoptive transfer of each cell type has been functioning as immunotherapy in experimental models, being particularly effective when using M2 macrophages generated with an optimized interleukin-4 (IL-4)/interleukin-10 (IL-10)/transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) combination. As a prerequisite for eventual translation of M2 therapy into clinical settings we herein studied the induction, stability and mechanism of generation of human induced Tregs (iTregs) by M2 macrophages generated with IL-4/IL-10/TGF-β. The supernatants of monocyte-derived human M2 macrophages robustly induced FOXP3 and other Treg signature molecules such as CTLA-4 and IKZF4 in human naïve CD4 T cells. M2-induced iTregs displayed enhanced FOXP3 stability and low expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ and IL-17, as well as functional immunosuppressive activity compared with control T cells. The FOXP3-inducing activity was dependent on TGF-β, which was both expressed and captured with re-release by M2 macrophages into the soluble supernatant fraction, in which the TGF-β was not confined to extracellular vesicles such as exosomes. We propose that adoptive transfer of human M2 macrophages may be exploited in the future to induce Tregs in situ by delivering TGF-β, which could be developed as a therapeutic strategy to target autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases.

Temozolomide resistance and tumor recurrence: Halting the Hedgehog.	Cancer Cell Microenviron	2015	Chemotherapy with Temozolomide (TMZ), radiation and surgery are the primary methods to treat Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the most common adult intracranial tumor with dismal outcome. GBM resistance to therapy is the main reason of poor patient outcomes. Thus, methods to overcome the resistance are an area of extensive research. This highlight focuses on three recently published articles on the mechanism of resistance and possible therapeutic intervention, including RNA treatment with stem cells. We showed a crucial role of the developmental Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway in the acquisition and maintenance of TMZ resistance. SHH signaling caused TMZ resistance in GBM cells through an increase in the multiple drug resistance gene (MDR1). The SHH receptor, Patched-1 (PTCH1), negatively regulate SHH signaling. In GBM, miR-9 suppressed PTCH1 levels, resulting in the activation of SHH pathway. Thus, SHH signaling is independent of the ligand in resistant GBM cells. MiR-9 was also increased in chemoresistance CD133+ GBM cells. A potential method to reverse resistance was tested by delivering the anti-miR in bone marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs). The anti-miR-9 was transferred into the resistant GBM cells through exosomes and gap junctional intercellular communication. We also review on-going clinical trials with inhibitor of SHH signaling, and also discuss drug delivery by cell therapy for GBM. While GBM treatment has proven to be a challenge, there are a number of novel approaches we are currently developing to manage this malignancy.	PMC4856152

Mol Neurodegener	2016	BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) act as key mediators of intercellular communication and are secreted and taken up by all cell types in the central nervous system (CNS). While detailed study of EV-based signaling is likely to significantly advance our understanding of human neurobiology, the technical challenges of isolating EVs from CNS tissues have limited their characterization using 'omics' technologies. We therefore developed a new Protein Organic Solvent Precipitation (PROSPR) method that can efficiently isolate the EV repertoire from human biological samples. RESULTS: In the current report, we present a novel experimental workflow that outlines the process of sample extraction and enrichment of CNS-derived EVs using PROSPR. Subsequent LC-MS/MS-based proteomic profiling of EVs enriched from brain homogenates successfully identified 86 of the top 100 exosomal markers. Proteomic profiling of PROSPR-enriched CNS EVs indicated that > 75 % of the proteins identified matched previously reported exosomal and microvesicle cargoes, while also expanded the known human EV-associated proteome with 685 novel identifications. Similarly, lipidomic characterization of enriched CNS vesicles not only identified previously reported EV-specific lipid families (PS, SM, lysoPC, lysoPE) but also uncovered novel lipid isoforms not previously detected in human EVs. Finally, dedicated flow cytometry of PROSPR-CNS-EVs revealed that ~80 % of total microparticles observed were exosomes ranging in diameter from ≤100 nm to 300 nm. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the optimized use of PROSPR represents an easy-to-perform and inexpensive method of enriching EVs from human CNS tissues for detailed characterization by 'omics' technologies. We predict that widespread use of the methodology described herein will greatly accelerate the study of EVs biology in neuroscience.	PMC4877958

Molecules	2016	Shikonin is a naphthoquinone isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Lithospermum. It has been used in the treatment of various tumors. However, the effects of shikonin on such diseases have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we detected the exosome release of a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) with shikonin treatment and found a positive relationship between the level of secreted exosomes and cell proliferation. We next analyzed miRNA profiles in MCF-7 cells and exosomes and found that some miRNAs are specifically sorted and abundant in exosomes. Knockdown of the most abundant miRNAs in exosomes and the MCF-7 proliferation assay showed that miR-128 in exosomes negatively regulates the level of Bax in MCF-7 recipient cells and inhibits cell proliferation. These results show that shikonin inhibits the proliferation of MCF-7 cells through reducing tumor-derived exosomal miR-128. The current study suggests that shikonin suppresses MCF-7 growth by the inhibition of exosome release.

Fertil Steril	2016	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether microRNA (miRNA) expression profile is different in extracellular microvesicles collected from seminal plasma of men with oligoasthenozoospermia, to gain further insight into molecular mechanisms underlying male infertility. DESIGN: Microarray with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction validation and Western blot analysis confirmation. SETTING: University research and clinical institutes. PATIENT(S): A total of 24 men, including 12 oligoasthenozoospermic subfertile men and 12 normozoospermic men. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Statistically significant altered miRNA expression profiles in oligoasthenozoospermic subfertile men compared with normozoospermic fertile men. RESULT(S): Extracellular microvesicles including exosomes were isolated from seminal plasma by ultracentrifugation. Presence of exosome-specific proteins was confirmed by Western blotting. In the extracellular microvesicles, we analyzed 1,205 miRNAs by microarray and identified 36 miRNAs with altered expression levels in oligoasthenozoospermic compared with normozoospermic fertile men. Seven miRNAs were overexpressed and 29 miRNAs were underexpressed in oligoasthenozoospermic men. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction as an independent method, we confirmed the significantly higher expression levels of miR-765 and miR-1275 and the significantly lower expression level of miR-15a in oligoasthenozoospermic subfertile men as compared with the normozoospermic men. CONCLUSION(S): We identified altered expression levels of miRNAs in extracellular microvesicles from seminal plasma as part of the molecular events in the male genital tract. These miRNAs may help to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying male infertility.

Albuminuria is not associated with elevated urinary vesicle concentration but can confound nanoparticle tracking analysis.	Nephrology (Carlton)	2017	AIM: Extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, are present in urine with reports of roles in intercellular signalling and diagnostic utility. However, the extent to which the concentration and characteristics of urinary vesicles are altered in albuminuric renal disease has not been well characterized. In this study, we examined the number and characteristics of extracellular vesicles in albuminuric urine. METHODS: Vesicles were isolated from the urine of 32 patients with varying levels of albuminuria using ultracentrifugation and density gradient purification and were examined using nanoparticle tracking analysis, immunoblotting and transmission electron microscopy. The size profile of particles in these urine preparations was compared with albumin-containing solutions. RESULTS: Overall, there were no substantial differences in the number, or characteristics, of vesicles released into proteinuric urine. Analysis of albumin-containing solutions showed particles of exosome-like size, suggesting that such particles can mimic exosomes in standard nanoparticle tracking analysis. Albumin and IgG depletion of proteinuric urine resulted in a substantial reduction in the concentration of particles detected by nanoparticle tracking analysis. CONCLUSION: There was no increase in urinary vesicle concentration in patients with albuminuria. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the need for cautious interpretation of nanoparticle tracking analysis of vesicle concentration in biological fluids containing protein and for sophisticated preparative methods in vesicle purification from urine.

Med J Islam Repub Iran	2016	BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles are particles ranged from 30 nm to 5μm and subcategorized into three groups; exosomes, microvesicles and apoptotic bodies, each of which have different biological impact. Lack of a standard method for the detection and isolation of MVs has led to a challenging issue that is a worth considering. In this study, we isolated MVs from the conditioned medium of UC-MSCs by four different schemes of ultracentrifugation. METHODS: We examined the efficacy of differential centrifugation ranging from 10,000×g to 60,000×g on UCMSCs- derived microvesicles yield and purity. The fractions were evaluated by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) method, total protein quantification and flow cytometry. RESULTS: UC-MSCs were spindle cells that adhered to plastic culture flasks. These cells expressed MSC markers such as CD44 and CD73, whereas were negative for hematopoietic markers CD45 and CD34. UC-MSCparticles were successfully isolated. Particles were heterogeneous vesicles of approximately 50 to 1250 nm in diameter that bear the surface-expressed molecules UC-MSCs such as; CD90, CD106, CD166 and CD44, and negative for CD34, CD63, and CD9. According to the results of DLS method, centrifugation at 10,000, 20,000, 40,000 and 60,000 ×g, all gave MVs of less than 1000 nm. It is of notion that only at the centrifugation rates of 40,000 and 60,000×g, particles of less than 100 nm in diameter were also obtained. CONCLUSION: The choice of exact speed greatly influences the purity of MVs and their yield. Our findings indicate that centrifugation at 20,000×g is appropriate for the purification of UC-MSC-MVs.

Methods Mol Biol	2016	Exosomes are nanovesicles of endocytic origin that are about 30-100 nm in diameter, surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane, and contain proteins, nucleic acids, and other molecules. Mammalian cells- and biological fluids-derived exosomes have become the subject for a wide range of investigations in biological and biomedical sciences. More recently, a new interest is on the verge of rising: the presence of nanovesicles in plants. Lipoprotein vesicles from apoplastic fluid and exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) from fruit juice have been isolated and shown that they could be loaded with drugs and uptaken by recipient cells. In order to explore and analyze the contents and functions of ELVs, they must be isolated and purified with intense care. Isolation of ELVs can be a tedious process and often characterized by the co-purification of undesired contaminants. Here we describe a method which isolates ELVs based on their buoyant density. The method utilizes differential centrifugation in step 1 and 1 and 2 M sucrose/deuterium oxide double-cushion ultracentrifugation in step 2, to purify two diverse ELV subpopulations. In this method fruit juice is used as an example of starting material, although this protocol can be used for the isolation of vesicles from apoplastic fluid too. The quality and the quantity of ELV preparations have been found appropriate for downstream biological and structural studies, like proteomics, transcriptomics, and lipidomics.

Mol Cancer Res	2017	Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells metastasize within the peritoneal cavity and directly encounter human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC) as the initial step of metastasis. The contact between ovarian cancer cells and the single layer of mesothelial cells involves direct communications that modulate cancer progression but the mechanisms are unclear. One candidate mediating cell-cell communications is exosomes, 30-100 nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin, through the cell-cell transfer of proteins, mRNAs, or microRNAs. Therefore, the goal was to mechanistically characterize how EOC-derived exosomes modulate metastasis. Exosomes from ovarian cancer cells were fluorescently labeled and cocultured with HPMCs which internalized the exosomes. Upon exosome uptake, HPMCs underwent a change in cellular morphology to a mesenchymal, spindle phenotype. CD44, a cell surface glycoprotein, was found to be enriched in the cancer cell-derived exosomes, transferred, and internalized to HPMCs, leading to high levels of CD44 in HPMCs. This increased CD44 expression in HPMCs promoted cancer invasion by inducing the HPMCs to secrete MMP9 and by cleaning the mesothelial barrier for improved cancer cell invasion. When CD44 expression was knocked down in cancer cells, exosomes had fewer effects on HPMCs. The inhibition of exosome release from cancer cells blocked CD44 internalization in HPMCs and suppressed ovarian cancer invasion. In ovarian cancer omental metastasis, positive CD44 expression was observed in those mesothelial cells that directly interacted with cancer cells, whereas CD44 expression was negative in the mesothelial cells remote from the invading edge. This study indicates that ovarian cancer-derived exosomes transfer CD44 to HPMCs, facilitating cancer invasion. IMPLICATIONS: Mechanistic insight from the current study suggests that therapeutic targeting of exosomes may be beneficial in treating ovarian cancer. Mol Cancer Res; 15(1); 78-92. ©2016 AACR.

Circ Res	2017	RATIONALE: Studies have demonstrated that exosomes can repair cardiac tissue post-myocardial infarction and recapitulate the benefits of cellular therapy. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the role of donor age and hypoxia of human pediatric cardiac progenitor cell (CPC)-derived exosomes in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human CPCs from the right atrial appendages from children of different ages undergoing cardiac surgery for congenital heart defects were isolated and cultured under hypoxic or normoxic conditions. Exosomes were isolated from the culture-conditioned media and delivered to athymic rats after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Echocardiography at day 3 post-myocardial infarction suggested statistically improved function in neonatal hypoxic and neonatal normoxic groups compared with saline-treated controls. At 28 days post-myocardial infarction, exosomes derived from neonatal normoxia, neonatal hypoxia, infant hypoxia, and child hypoxia significantly improved cardiac function compared with those from saline-treated controls. Staining showed decreased fibrosis and improved angiogenesis in hypoxic groups compared with controls. Finally, using sequencing data, a computational model was generated to link microRNA levels to specific outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: CPC exosomes derived from neonates improved cardiac function independent of culture oxygen levels, whereas CPC exosomes from older children were not reparative unless subjected to hypoxic conditions. Cardiac functional improvements were associated with increased angiogenesis, reduced fibrosis, and improved hypertrophy, resulting in improved cardiac function; however, mechanisms for normoxic neonatal CPC exosomes improved function independent of those mechanisms. This is the first study of its kind demonstrating that donor age and oxygen content in the microenvironment significantly alter the efficacy of human CPC-derived exosomes.	PMC5315680

Methods Mol Biol	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EV), including exosomes, secreted vesicles of endocytic origin, and microvesicles derived from the plasma membrane, have been widely isolated and characterized from conditioned culture media and bodily fluids. The difficulty in isolating EV from tissues, however, has hindered their study in vivo. Here, we describe a novel method designed to isolate EV and characterize exosomes from the extracellular space of brain tissues. The purification of EV is achieved by gentle dissociation of the tissue to free the brain extracellular space, followed by sequential low-speed centrifugations, filtration, and ultracentrifugations. To further purify EV from other extracellular components, they are separated on a sucrose step gradient. Characterization of the sucrose step gradient fractions by electron microscopy demonstrates that this method yields pure EV preparations free of large vesicles, subcellular organelles, or debris. The level of EV secretion and content are determined by assays for acetylcholinesterase activity and total protein estimation, and exosomal identification and protein content are analyzed by Western blot and immuno-electron microscopy. Additionally, we present here a method to delipidate EV in order to improve the resolution of downstream electrophoretic analysis of EV proteins.

Nanosized UCMSC-derived extracellular vesicles but not conditioned medium exclusively inhibit the inflammatory response of stimulated T cells: implications for nanomedicine.	Theranostics	2017	Undesired immune responses have drastically hampered outcomes after allogeneic organ transplantation and cell therapy, and also lead to inflammatory diseases and autoimmunity. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) have powerful regenerative and immunomodulatory potential, and their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) are envisaged as a promising natural source of nanoparticles to increase outcomes in organ transplantation and control inflammatory diseases. However, poor EV preparations containing highly-abundant soluble proteins may mask genuine vesicular-associated functions and provide misleading data. Here, we used Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) to successfully isolate EVs from UCMSCs-conditioned medium. These vesicles were defined as positive for CD9, CD63, CD73 and CD90, and their size and morphology characterized by NTA and cryo-EM. Their immunomodulatory potential was determined in polyclonal T cell proliferation assays, analysis of cytokine profiles and in the skewing of monocyte polarization. In sharp contrast to the non-EV containing fractions, to the complete conditioned medium and to ultracentrifuged pellet, SEC-purified EVs from UCMSCs inhibited T cell proliferation, resembling the effect of parental UCMSCs. Moreover, while SEC-EVs did not induce cytokine response, the non-EV fractions, conditioned medium and ultracentrifuged pellet promoted the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by polyclonally stimulated T cells and supported Th17 polarization. In contrast, EVs did not induce monocyte polarization, but the non-EV fraction induced CD163 and CD206 expression and TNF-α production in monocytes. These findings increase the growing evidence confirming that EVs are an active component of MSC's paracrine immunosuppressive function and affirm their potential for therapeutics in nanomedicine. In addition, our results highlight the importance of well-purified and defined preparations of MSC-derived EVs to achieve the immunosuppressive effect.	PMC5197063

BMC Cell Biol	2017	BACKGROUND: Sprouting angiogenesis requires vascular endothelial proliferation, migration and morphogenesis. The process is regulated by soluble factors, principally vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and via bidirectional signaling through the Jagged/Notch system, leading to assignment of tip cell and stalk cell identity. The cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) can either stimulate or inhibit angiogenesis via its differential surface receptor signaling. Here we evaluate changes in expression of angiogenic signaling receptors when bovine aortic endothelial cells were exposed to TGF-β1 under low serum conditions. RESULTS: TGF-β1 induced a dose dependent inhibition of tip cell assignment and subsequent angiogenesis on Matrigel, maximal at 5.0 ng/ml. This occurred via ALK5-dependent pathways and was accompanied by significant upregulation of the TGF-β co-receptor endoglin, and SMAD2 phosphorylation, but no alteration in Smad1/5 activation. TGF-β1 also induced ALK5-dependent downregulation of Notch1 but not of its ligand delta-like ligand 4. Cell associated VEGFR2 (but not VEGFR1) was significantly downregulated and accompanied by reciprocal upregulation of VEGFR2 in conditioned medium. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that this soluble VEGFR2 was not generated by a selective shift in mRNA isoform transcription. This VEGFR2 in conditioned medium was full-length protein and was associated with increased soluble HSP-90, consistent with a possible shedding of microvesicles/exosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that endothelial cells exposed to TGF-β1 lose both tip and stalk cell identity, possibly mediated by loss of VEGFR2 signaling. The role of these events in physiological and pathological angiogenesis requires further investigation.	PMC5260130

Enhanced Cardioprotection by Human Endometrium Mesenchymal Stem Cells Driven by Exosomal MicroRNA-21.	Stem Cells Transl Med	2017	Our group recently reported positive therapeutic benefit of human endometrium-derived mesenchymal stem cells (EnMSCs) delivered to infarcted rat myocardium, an effect that correlated with enhanced secretion of protective cytokines and growth factors compared with parallel cultures of human bone marrow MSCs (BMMSCs). To define more precisely the molecular mechanisms of EnMSC therapy, in the present study, we assessed in parallel the paracrine and therapeutic properties of MSCs derived from endometrium, bone marrow, and adipose tissues in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). EnMSCs, BMMSCs, and adipose-derived MSCs (AdMSCs) were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Paracrine and cytoprotective actions were assessed in vitro by coculture with neonatal cardiomyocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. A rat MI model was used to compare cell therapy by intramyocardial injection of BMMSCs, AdMSCs, and EnMSCs. We found that EnMSCs conferred superior cardioprotection relative to BMMSCs or AdMSCs and supported enhanced microvessel density. Inhibitor studies indicated that the enhanced paracrine actions of EnMSCs were mediated by secreted exosomes. Analyses of exosomal microRNAs (miRs) by miR array and quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that miR-21 expression was selectively enhanced in exosomes derived from EnMSCs. Selective antagonism of miR-21 by anti-miR treatment abolished the antiapoptotic and angiogenic effects of EnMSCs with parallel effects on phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a miR-21 target and downstream Akt. The results of the present study confirm the superior cardioprotection by EnMSCs relative to BMMSCs or AdMSCs and implicates miR-21 as a potential mediator of EnMSC therapy by enhancing cell survival through the PTEN/Akt pathway. The endometrium might be a preferential source of MSCs for cardiovascular cell therapy. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2017;6:209-222.	PMC5442741

J Leukoc Biol	2017	Bacterial pneumonia is a common and serious clinical entity. Alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages are the first line of defense in the innate immunity against bacterial pathogens. Epithelial cells are known to release chemokines/cytokines that recruit and activate phagocytic cells. However, the signals sent from alveolar macrophages back to the lung epithelial cells remain largely unexplored. We found that LPS, a well-recognized stimulator derived from gram-negative (G-) bacteria, rapidly and robustly induces the secretion of macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). The main type of EVs found in the early stages after LPS stimulation are apoptotic bodies (ABs) and not microvesicles (MVs) or exosomes (Exos). Furthermore, LPS markedly up-regulate the levels of a repertoire of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the macrophage-derived ABs, including miR-221 and miR-222. Functionally, the LPS-induced, macrophage-derived ABs promote the proliferation of malignant and/or normal lung epithelial cells. We next directly transfected miR-221 and/or miR-222 inhibitors into the LPS-induced ABs. Deletion of miR-221/222 in ABs significantly reduces the AB-mediated proliferation of lung epithelial cells. Mechanistically, AB-shuttling miR-221/222 promote cell growth by modulating cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) pathways. Collectively, LPS-induced, macrophage-derived ABs promote the proliferation of their recipient epithelial cells, partially via AB-shuttling miRNAs.	PMC5433853

Priming Adipose Stem Cells with Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Preconditioning Potentiates Their Exosome Efficacy for Bone Regeneration.	Tissue Eng Part A	2017	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used for tissue repair and regeneration. However, the inherent drawbacks, including limited cell survival after cell transplantation, have hindered direct MSC transplantation for tissue repair and regeneration. The aim of this study was to investigate if exosomes isolated from MSCs can promote the proliferation and differentiation of human primary osteoblastic cells (HOBs) and be potentially used for bone tissue regeneration. We showed that adipose tissue-derived MSC (ASC)-derived exosomes (ASC-EXO) were able to promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in HOBs; and the trophic effects of ASC-EXO on HOBs were further harnessed when ASCs were preconditioned with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) for 3 days, which mimics the acute inflammatory phase upon bone injury. In addition, we showed that Wnt-3a content was elevated in ASC-EXO when ASCs were preconditioned by TNF-α, and inhibiting Wnt signaling decreased the osteogenic gene expression levels in HOBs which were cultured in TNF-α preconditioned ASCs conditioned medium. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that ASC-EXO, especially primed by TNF-α preconditioning on ASCs, offer a promising approach to replace direct stem cell transplantation for bone repair and regeneration.

Comprehensive Analytical Approach toward Glycomic Characterization and Profiling in Urinary Exosomes.	Anal Chem	2017	Exosomes are extracellular nanosized vesicles with lipid bilayers encapsulating nucleic acids and proteins, both with and without glycosylation. While exosomal nucleic acids and proteins have previously been explored to identify cancer biomarkers with some promising results, little information has been available concerning their glycoconjugate content. Exosomes were isolated from normal urine samples through multistep differential centrifugation. The isolated exosomes have an average size of 146 nm and a spherical shape, as determined by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. N-Glycans were enzymatically released from the isolated vesicles. After being reduced and permethylated, N-glycans were measured by MALDI mass spectrometry. Paucimannosidic, high-mannose, and complex type glycans were identified and their relative abundances were determined. Some detailed structures of these glycans were revealed through liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). The reduced N-glycans, without being permethylated, were also separated and analyzed by LC/MS-MS, and their structures were further detailed through isomeric separation on porous graphitized carbon (PGC) packed in long capillaries. Using microfractionation before LC/MS-MS, minor multiantennary N-glycans were preconcentrated as based on hydrophobicity or charge. Preconcentration of the reduced and permethylated glycans on a C18 cartridge revealed numerous large glycans, whereas fractionation of the reduced N-glycans by ion-exchange cartridges facilitated detection of sulfated glycans. After removing N-glycans from the original sample aliquot, O-glycans were chemically released from urinary exosomes and profiled, revealing some unusual structures.

Interleukin-10 Deficiency Impairs Reparative Properties of Bone Marrow-Derived Endothelial Progenitor Cell Exosomes.	Tissue Eng Part A	2017	Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-based therapy has immense potential to promote cardiac neovascularization and attenuate ischemic injury. Functional benefits of EPCs and other adult stem cell therapies largely involve paracrine mechanisms and exosomes secreted by stem cells are emerging as pivotal paracrine entity of stem/progenitor cells. However, modest outcomes after EPC-/stem cell-based clinical trials suggest that stem cell/exosome function might be modulated by stimuli they encounter in ischemic tissues, including systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that EPCs under inflammatory stress might produce exosomes of altered and dysfunctional content, which may compromise EPC repair in ischemic heart disease. We have previously shown that EPCs obtained from interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10KO) mice (model mimicking systemic inflammation) display impaired angiogenic functions. Whether IL-10KO-EPC-derived exosomes inherit their parental dysfunctional phenotype and whether inflammatory environment alters the cargo of their secreted exosomes are not known. After cell expansion from IL-10KO and wild-type (WT) mice, we isolated exosomes and compared their functions in terms of effect on cell survival, proliferation, migration, and angiogenic capacity in vitro. WT-EPC-Exo treatment enhanced endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation, and inhibited apoptosis, whereas IL-10KO-Exo exhibited impaired or even detrimental effects, suggesting that the reparative capacity of WT-EPC-Exo is lost in exosomes derived from IL-10-KO-EPCs. Deep RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses to compare WT and IL-10KO-Exo revealed drastically altered exosome cargo. Importantly, IL-10KO-EPC-Exo were highly enriched in microRNAs and proteins that promote inflammation and apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis. Through modulation of a specific enriched miRNA (miR-375), we partially rescued IL-10KO-EPC-Exo dysfunction. Thus, our study revealed that EPC exosomes display impaired function under inflammatory stimulus through changed exosome contents, and the dysfunction can be rescued by modulation of a specific target packed in exosomes.

Identification and characteristics of extracellular vesicles from bovine blastocysts produced in vitro.	PLoS One	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been identified within different body fluids and cell culture media. However, there is very little information on the secretion of these vesicles during early embryonic development. The aims of this work were first to demonstrate the secretion of extracellular vesicles by pre-implantation bovine embryos and second to identify and characterize the population of EVs secreted by bovine blastocysts during the period from day seven to nine of embryo culture and its correlation with further embryo development up to day 11. Bovine embryos were produced by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or parthenogenetic activation (PA) and cultured until blastocyst stage. Blastocyst selection was performed at day 7 post IVF/PA considering two variables: stage of development and quality of embryos. Selected blastocysts were cultured in vitro for 48 hours in groups (exp. 1) or individually (exp. 2) in SOF media depleted of exosomes. At day 9 post IVF/PA the media was collected and EVs isolated by ultracentrifugation. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of heterogeneous vesicles of different sizes and population: microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes (EXs) of rounded shape, enclosed by a lipid bi-layer and ranging from 30 to 385 nm of diameter. Flow cytometry analysis allowed identifying CD63 and CD9 proteins as exosome markers. Nanoparticle tracking analysis generated a large number of variables, which required the use of multivariate statistics. The results indicated that the concentration of vesicles is higher in those blastocysts with arrested development from day 9 up to day 11 of in vitro development (6.7 x 108 particles/ml) derived from IVF (p <0.05), compared to PA blastocysts (4.7 x 108 particles/ml). Likewise, the profile (concentration and diameter) of particles secreted by embryos derived from IVF were different from those secreted by PA embryos. In conclusion, we demonstrated that bovine blastocysts secrete MVs/EXs to the culture media. Data suggest that characteristics of the population of EVs vary depending on embryo competence.	PMC5444795

Cancer Lett	2017	Exosomes (Exo), powerful intercellular communicators, are recovered in all body fluids, suggesting suitability for diagnosis and prognosis. Easy in vitro manipulation recommends Exo as drug vehicles. Aiming to consolidate diagnostic and therapeutic potential of Exo, we evaluated recovery and fate of tumor (TEX) and exogenous Exo in syngeneic and xenogeneic mice bearing a murine or a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A significant increase in serum (S)-TEX was observed 2 weeks after tumor cell application. Instead, S-TEX declined within 3-6 days after tumor excision. Intravenously injected dye-labeled TEX were rapidly cleared from the serum. Partly being degraded in the liver, the majority is taken-up by PBL, liver, bone marrow and lung cells. In the tumor-bearing host TEX persisted longer becoming enriched in tumor cells and metastatic organs. Accordingly, an antibody blockade of a TEX marker hampered disseminated tumor cell settlement in selected organs. In brief, a tumor marker panel appears suited for S-TEX recovery. In murine models, S-TEX are qualified for therapy control and follow-up studies. Despite rapid clearance from the serum, Exo uptake by host cells is most promising for tailored Exo as drug transporter.

Autologous intramuscular transplantation of engineered satellite cells induces exosome-mediated systemic expression of Fukutin-related protein and rescues disease phenotype in a murine model of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I.	Hum Mol Genet	2017	α-Dystroglycanopathies are a group of muscular dystrophies characterized by α-DG hypoglycosylation and reduced extracellular ligand-binding affinity. Among other genes involved in the α-DG glycosylation process, fukutin related protein (FKRP) gene mutations generate a wide range of pathologies from mild limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2I (LGMD2I), severe congenital muscular dystrophy 1C (MDC1C), to Walker-Warburg Syndrome and Muscle-Eye-Brain disease. FKRP gene encodes for a glycosyltransferase that in vivo transfers a ribitol phosphate group from a CDP -ribitol present in muscles to α-DG, while in vitro it can be secreted as monomer of 60kDa. Consistently, new evidences reported glycosyltransferases in the blood, freely circulating or wrapped within vesicles. Although the physiological function of blood stream glycosyltransferases remains unclear, they are likely released from blood borne or distant cells. Thus, we hypothesized that freely or wrapped FKRP might circulate as an extracellular glycosyltransferase, able to exert a "glycan remodelling" process, even at distal compartments. Interestingly, we firstly demonstrated a successful transduction of MDC1C blood-derived CD133+ cells and FKRP L276IKI mouse derived satellite cells by a lentiviral vector expressing the wild-type of human FKRP gene. Moreover, we showed that LV-FKRP cells were driven to release exosomes carrying FKRP. Similarly, we observed the presence of FKRP positive exosomes in the plasma of FKRP L276IKI mice intramuscularly injected with engineered satellite cells. The distribution of FKRP protein boosted by exosomes determined its restoration within muscle tissues, an overall recovery of α-DG glycosylation and improved muscle strength, suggesting a systemic supply of FKRP protein acting as glycosyltransferase.

Sci Rep	2017	Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted by multiple cell types into the extracellular space. They contain cell-state specific cargos which often reflects the (patho)physiological condition of the cells/organism. Milk contains high amounts of exosomes and it is unclear whether their cargo is altered based on the lactation stage of the organism. Here, we isolated exosomes from bovine milk that were obtained at various stages of lactation and examined the content by quantitative proteomics. Exosomes were isolated by OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation from milk obtained from cow after 24, 48 and 72 h post calving. As control, exosomes were also isolated from cows during mid-lactation period which has been referred to as mature milk (MM). Biochemical and biophysical characterization of exosomes revealed the high abundance of exosomes in colostrum and MM samples. Quantitative proteomics analysis highlighted the change in the proteomic cargo of exosomes based on the lactation state of the cow. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that exosomes from colostrum are significantly enriched with proteins that can potentially regulate the immune response and growth. This study highlights the importance of exosomes in colostrum and hence opens up new avenues to exploit these vesicles in the regulation of the immune response and growth.	PMC5517456

Stem Cell Res Ther	2017	BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for osteoarthritis (OA) has been widely investigated, but the mechanisms are still unclear. Exosomes that serve as carriers of genetic information have been implicated in many diseases and are known to participate in many physiological processes. Here, we investigate the therapeutic potential of exosomes from human embryonic stem cell-induced mesenchymal stem cells (ESC-MSCs) in alleviating osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Exosomes were harvested from conditioned culture media of ESC-MSCs by a sequential centrifugation process. Primary mouse chondrocytes treated with interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) were used as an in vitro model to evaluate the effects of the conditioned medium with or without exosomes and titrated doses of isolated exosomes for 48 hours, prior to immunocytochemistry or western blot analysis. Destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery was performed on the knee joints of C57BL/6 J mice as an OA model. This was followed by intra-articular injection of either ESC-MSCs or their exosomes. Cartilage destruction and matrix degradation were evaluated with histological staining and OARSI scores at the post-surgery 8 weeks. RESULTS: We found that intra-articular injection of ESC-MSCs alleviated cartilage destruction and matrix degradation in the DMM model. Further in vitro studies illustrated that this effect was exerted through ESC-MSC-derived exosomes. These exosomes maintained the chondrocyte phenotype by increasing collagen type II synthesis and decreasing ADAMTS5 expression in the presence of IL-1β. Immunocytochemistry revealed colocalization of the exosomes and collagen type II-positive chondrocytes. Subsequent intra-articular injection of exosomes derived from ESC-MSCs successfully impeded cartilage destruction in the DMM model. CONCLUSIONS: The exosomes from ESC-MSCs exert a beneficial therapeutic effect on OA by balancing the synthesis and degradation of chondrocyte extracellular matrix (ECM), which in turn provides a new target for OA drug and drug-delivery system development.

Virus Res	2017	The cellular secretory vesicles known as 'exosomes' have emerged as key player in intercellular transport and communication between different eukaryotic in order to maintain body homeostasis. Many pathogenic viruses utilize exosome pathway to efficiently transfer bioactive components from infected cells to naïve cells. Here, we show that HBx can tweak the exosome biogenesis machinery both by enhancing neutral sphingomyelinase2 activity as well as by interacting with exosomal biomarkers such as neutral sphingomyelinase2, CD9 and CD81. The nano particle tracking analysis revealed enhanced secretion of exosomes by the HBx-expressing cells while confocal studies confirmed the co-localization of HBx with CD9 and CD63. Importantly, we observed the encapsulation of HBx mRNA and protein in these exosomes besides some other qualitative changes. The exosomal cargo secreted by HBx-expressing cells had a profound effect on the recipient hepatic cells including creation of a milieu conducive for cellular-transformation. Thus, the present study unfolds a novel role of HBx in intercellular communication by facilitating horizontal transfer of viral gene products and other host factors via exosomes in order to support viral spread and pathogenesis.

Electronic address: .	ralphsanderson@uabmc.edu		Chemotherapy induces secretion of exosomes loaded with heparanase that degrades extracellular matrix and impacts tumor and host cell behavior.	Matrix Biol	2018	The heparan sulfate-degrading enzyme heparanase promotes the progression of many cancers by driving tumor cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis. Heparanase accomplishes this via multiple mechanisms including its recently described effect on enhancing biogenesis of tumor exosomes. Because we recently discovered that heparanase expression is upregulated in myeloma cells that survive chemotherapy, we were prompted to investigate the impact of anti-myeloma drugs on exosome biogenesis. When myeloma cells were exposed to the commonly utilized anti-myeloma drugs bortezomib, carfilzomib or melphalan, exosome secretion by the cells was dramatically enhanced. These chemotherapy-induced exosomes (chemoexosomes) have a proteome profile distinct from cells not exposed to drug including a dramatic elevation in the level of heparanase present as exosome cargo. The chemoexosome heparanase was not found inside the chemoexosome, but was present on the exosome surface where it was capable of degrading heparan sulfate embedded within an extracellular matrix. When exposed to myeloma cells, chemoexosomes transferred their heparanase cargo to those cells, enhancing their heparan sulfate degrading activity and leading to activation of ERK signaling and an increase in shedding of the syndecan-1 proteoglycan. Exposure of chemoexosomes to macrophages enhanced their secretion of TNF-α, an important myeloma growth factor. Moreover, chemoexosomes stimulated macrophage migration and this effect was blocked by H1023, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits heparanase enzymatic activity. These data suggest that anti-myeloma therapy ignites a burst of exosomes having a high level of heparanase that remodels extracellular matrix and alters tumor and host cell behaviors that likely contribute to chemoresistance and eventual patient relapse. SUMMARY: We find that anti-myeloma chemotherapy dramatically stimulates secretion of exosomes and alters exosome composition. Exosomes secreted during therapy contain high levels of heparanase on their surface that can degrade ECM and also can be transferred to both tumor and host cells, altering their behavior in ways that may enhance tumor survival and progression.

Exosomes of invasive urothelial carcinoma cells are characterized by a specific miRNA expression signature.	Oncotarget	2017	Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) represents a highly aggressive tumor type compared to non-muscle-invasive tumors. MIBC is characterized by specific molecular alterations, which may also modulate extracellular tumorigenic effects. Tumor-associated exosomes, especially exosomal miRNAs, are important regulators in the interaction between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment by affecting tumor-promoting processes in target cells. It is important to analyze whether their exosomal patterns also reflect the specific molecular characteristics of MIBC. The aim of this study was to compare the miRNA expression in secreted exosomes from urinary bladder cancer cells (UBC) with different degrees of invasiveness. By electron microscopy, nanotracking analysis and western blot we proofed a high quality of isolated exosomes. Microarray analysis identified an invasion-associated signature of 15 miRNAs, which is significantly altered in exosomes of invasive UBC compared to non-invasive counterparts. Therefrom, 9 miRNAs are consistent differently expressed in both, invasive cells and their secreted exosomes. The remaining 6 exosome-specific miRNAs are only deregulated in exosomes but not in their parental cells. MiRNA alterations were verified by qPCR in cell culture and urinary exosomes. In conclusion, we showed that exosomes from invasive UBC cells are characterized by a specific miRNA signature. Further analyses have to clarify the functional relevance of exosomal miRNAs secreted by invasive bladder cancer cells for modification of the tumor microenvironment and their putative role as molecular markers in liquid biopsies.

Best practice of identification and proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles in human health and disease.	Expert Rev Proteomics	2017	INTRODUCTION: Extracellular vesicles are emerging sources of biomarkers for modern preventive and precision medicine. Extracellular vesicles in body fluids offer a unique opportunity for integrative biomarker approaches due to their complex biocargo that includes proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and metabolites. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics data suggest that a significant portion of human proteins are sorted into extracellular vesicles and amenable for biomarker discovery schemes. Areas covered: this review focuses on key aspects of isolation, quality control and subsequent analysis of blood plasma- and conditioned medium-derived extracellular vesicle proteins, and summarizes the current state-of-the-art in the field. Furthermore, it provides introduction and guidelines for mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles. Expert commentary: Comparison of newly developed isolation and purification techniques with classical ultracentrifugation-based approaches are highly recommended. It is also essential to use multiple analytical approaches to characterize the isolated extracellular vesicles prior to characterization of their biocargo. Rigor in data reproducibility, critical data analysis, awareness of potential pitfalls, standardization and benchmarking are required for extracellular vesicle research to fulfil the current expectation that these subcellular structures can become a valid source of next generation biomarkers.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2017	RNAs have been shown to undergo transfer between mammalian cells, although the mechanism behind this phenomenon and its overall importance to cell physiology is not well understood. Numerous publications have suggested that RNAs (microRNAs and incomplete mRNAs) undergo transfer via extracellular vesicles (e.g., exosomes). However, in contrast to a diffusion-based transfer mechanism, we find that full-length mRNAs undergo direct cell-cell transfer via cytoplasmic extensions characteristic of membrane nanotubes (mNTs), which connect donor and acceptor cells. By employing a simple coculture experimental model and using single-molecule imaging, we provide quantitative data showing that mRNAs are transferred between cells in contact. Examples of mRNAs that undergo transfer include those encoding GFP, mouse β-actin, and human Cyclin D1, BRCA1, MT2A, and HER2. We show that intercellular mRNA transfer occurs in all coculture models tested (e.g., between primary cells, immortalized cells, and in cocultures of immortalized human and murine cells). Rapid mRNA transfer is dependent upon actin but is independent of de novo protein synthesis and is modulated by stress conditions and gene-expression levels. Hence, this work supports the hypothesis that full-length mRNAs undergo transfer between cells through a refined structural connection. Importantly, unlike the transfer of miRNA or RNA fragments, this process of communication transfers genetic information that could potentially alter the acceptor cell proteome. This phenomenon may prove important for the proper development and functioning of tissues as well as for host-parasite or symbiotic interactions.	PMC5699038

Differential Content of Proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs Suggests that MDSC and Their Exosomes May Mediate Distinct Immune Suppressive Functions.	J Proteome Res	2018	Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are immature myeloid cells that accumulate in the circulation and the tumor microenvironment of most cancer patients. There, MDSC suppress both adaptive and innate immunity, hindering immunotherapies. The inflammatory milieu often present in cancers facilitates MDSC suppressive activity, causing aggressive tumor progression and metastasis. MDSC from tumor-bearing mice release exosomes, which carry biologically active proteins and mediate some of the immunosuppressive functions characteristic of MDSC. Studies on other cell types have shown that exosomes may also carry RNAs which can be transferred to local and distant cells, yet the mRNA and microRNA cargo of MDSC-derived exosomes has not been studied to date. Here, the cargo of MDSC and their exosomes was interrogated with the goal of identifying and characterizing molecules that may facilitate MDSC suppressive potency. Because inflammation is an established driving force for MDSC suppressive activity, we used the well-established 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma system, which includes "conventional" as well as "inflammatory" MDSC. We provide evidence that MDSC-derived exosomes carry proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs with different quantitative profiles than those of their parental cells. Several of these molecules have known or predicted functions consistent with MDSC suppressive activity, suggesting a potential mechanistic redundancy.

Placental exosomes: A proxy to understand pregnancy complications.	Am J Reprod Immunol	2018	Exosomes (30- to 150-nm particles), originating from multivesicular bodies by the invagination of the endosomal membrane, are communication channels between cells. Exosomes are released by various cell types and cargo proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids reflecting the physiologic status of their cells of origin and cause functional changes in recipient cells, which are likely dependent on their quantity and/or cargo contents. Recently, placental exosomes, produced by various placental cell types, have been isolated from maternal blood using the placental protein-specific marker, placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP). PLAP-positive exosomes are seen in maternal blood as early as the first trimester of pregnancy and increase as gestation progresses, with maximum numbers seen at term. Although the functional relevance of placental exosomes is still under investigation, several studies have linked placental exosomes changes (quantity and cargo) reflecting placental dysfunctions associated with adverse pregnancy events. As placental exosomes can be isolated from maternal blood, they are liquid biopsies reflecting placental functions. Hence, they are useful as biomarkers of placental functions and dysfunctions obtainable through non-invasive approaches. This review summarizes the biogenesis, release, and functions of exosomes and specifically expounds the role of placental-specific exosomes and their significance associated with pregnancy complications.

Immunosuppressive effect of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes on a concanavalin A-induced liver injury model.	Inflamm Regen	2016	Background: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes on an immune-induced liver injury model. MSCs show a unique function to modulate immune reaction although the molecular mechanisms are still under investigation. Exosomes are a nanoparticle containing microRNA and many ligands and are recognized as important factors secreted from MSC to express their function. This research is undertaken to evaluate the effect of MSC-derived exosome on concanavalin-A (con-A)-induced liver injury. Methods: Exosomes were collected from the supernatant of MSC from the bone marrow of C57B6 mice with ultracentrifugation. The collected exosomes or MSCs were injected intravenously into liver injury mice that had been prepared by the intravenous con-A injection. Liver and serum samples were collected 24 h later to evaluate the macro- and microscopic images, the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels. Phenotypical change of non-parenchymal liver cells was also evaluated by flow cytometry. Liver localization of PKH26 after the injection of PKH26-labeled exosomes or MSCs was observed by microscope. Each result was statistically analyzed with Student's t test. Results: PKH was observed in the liver after PKH-labeled exosomes were injected into mouse, whereas it was only observed in the lung in a mouse group receiving PKH-leveled MSC. There were decreases in ALT, liver necrotic areas, and the extent of apoptosis indicated by the single-stranded DNA index of groups that received multiple injections of MSC-derived exosomes, but an increase in the Ki-67 index. The mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines was enhanced. The number of Treg was increased among NPCs in a group receiving exosomes multiple times. Conclusions: Suppression of con-A-induced liver injury by injection of exosomes was observed as same extent as MSC. Considering the advantage of exosomes as its non-living nature and dosing adjustability over MSC, exosome will be one alternative of MSC transplantation.	PMC5725906

BMC Cancer	2018	BACKGROUND: Exosomes, small-membrane vesicles, are secreted by cells and include several types of proteins and nucleic acids. Exosomes transfer cellular information derived from donor cells and are involved in various physiological and pathological events, such as organ-specific metastasis. Elucidating the exosome uptake mechanisms is important for understanding the progression processes of organ-specific metastasis. However, whether the exosomes secreted by the donor cells are selectively or non-selectively incorporated into the recipient cells is unknown. METHODS: In this study, three human carcinoma cell lines, A549 (lung), HCT116 and COLO205 (colon), were used. The exosome isolation efficiency was compared between three methods: ultracentrifugation, ExoQuick-TC and Total Exosome Isolation kits. Recipient cells were treated with Pitstop 2, an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, or genistein, an inhibitor of caveolae-dependent endocytosis, and then incubated with DiO-labeled exosomes. RESULTS: Among the three methods examined, ultracentrifugation was the most efficient and reproducible. Exosomes derived from a donor cell line are incorporated into the three cell lines, but the exosome uptake capability was different depending on the recipient cell type and did not depend on the donor cell type. Exosome uptake in COLO205 was inhibited by Pitstop 2 and genistein. Exosome uptake in HCT116 was inhibited by Pitstop 2, but not genistein, while that in A549 cells was not inhibited by these inhibitors. Taken together, these results suggest that the exosomes secreted by donor cells are non-selectively incorporated into recipient cells and that the exosome uptake mechanism is different depending on the recipient cells. CONCLUSIONS: Different recipient cells' exosome uptake capabilities may be involved in organ-specific metastasis.	PMC5756423

J Extracell Vesicles	2018	Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of noncoding RNAs present in all eukaryotic cells investigated so far and generated by a special mode of alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. Thereby, single exons, or multiple adjacent and spliced exons, are released in a circular form. CircRNAs are cell-type specifically expressed, are unusually stable, and can be found in various body fluids such as blood and saliva. Here we analysed circRNAs and the corresponding linear splice isoforms from human platelets, where circRNAs are particularly abundant, compared with other hematopoietic cell types. In addition, we isolated extracellular vesicles from purified and in vitro activated human platelets, using density-gradient centrifugation, followed by RNA-seq analysis for circRNA detection. We could demonstrate that circRNAs are packaged and released within both types of vesicles (microvesicles and exosomes) derived from platelets. Interestingly, we observed a selective release of circRNAs into the vesicles, suggesting a specific sorting mechanism. In sum, circRNAs represent yet another class of extracellular RNAs that circulate in the body and may be involved in signalling pathways. Since platelets are essential for central physiological processes such as haemostasis, wound healing, inflammation and cancer metastasis, these findings should greatly extend the potential of circRNAs as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers.

Stem Cell Res Ther	2018	BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are an attractive therapeutic agent in regenerative medicine. Recently, there has been a paradigm shift from differentiation of MSCs to their paracrine effects at the injury site. Several reports elucidate the role of trophic factors secreted by MSCs toward the repair of injured tissues. We hypothesize that fractionating the MSC secretome will enrich exosomes containing soluble bioactive molecules, improving its therapeutic potential for liver failure. METHODS: Rat bone marrow MSCs were isolated and the conditioned media filtered, concentrated and ultracentrifuged to generate fractionated secretome. This secretome was characterized for the presence of exosomes and recovery from liver injury assessed in in-vitro liver injury models. The results were further validated in vivo. RESULTS: Studies on in-vitro liver injury models using acetaminophen and hydrogen peroxide show better cell recovery and reduced cytotoxicity in the presence of fractionated as opposed to unfractionated secretome. Further, the cells showed reduced oxidative stress in the presence of fractionated secretome, suggesting a potential antioxidative effect. These results were further validated in vivo in liver failure models, wherein improved liver regeneration in the presence of fractionated secretome (0.819 ± 0.035) was observed as compared to unfractionated secretome (0.718 ± 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: The work presented is a proof of concept that fractionating the secretome enriches certain bioactive molecules involved in the repair and recovery of injured liver tissue. Exosome enriched mesenchymal stromal cell-derived fractionated secretome potentiates recovery upon injection in injured liver.	PMC5801895

Acta Neuropathol Commun	2018	In Alzheimer disease and related disorders, the microtubule-associated protein tau aggregates and forms cytoplasmic lesions that impair neuronal physiology at many levels. In addition to affecting the host neuron, tau aggregates also spread to neighboring, recipient cells where the misfolded tau aggregates, in a manner similar to prions, actively corrupt the proper folding of soluble tau, and thereby impair cellular functions. One vehicle for the transmission of tau aggregates are secretory nanovesicles known as exosomes. Here, we established a simple model of a neuronal circuit using a microfluidics culture system in which hippocampal neurons A and B were seeded into chambers 1 and 2, respectively, extending axons via microgrooves in both directions and thereby interconnecting. This system served to establish two models to track exosome spreading. In the first model, we labeled the exosomal membrane by coupling tetraspanin CD9 with either a green or red fluorescent tag. This allowed us to reveal that interconnected neurons exchange exosomes only when their axons extend in close proximity. In the second model, we added exosomes isolated from the brains of tau transgenic rTg4510 mice (i.e. exogenous, neuron A-derived) to neurons in chamber 1 (neuron B) interconnected with neuron C in chamber 2. This allowed us to demonstrate that a substantial fraction of the exogenous exosomes were internalized by neuron B and passed then on to neuron C. This transportation from neuron B to C was achieved by a mechanism that is consistent with the hijacking of secretory endosomes by the exogenous exosomes, as revealed by confocal, super-resolution and electron microscopy. Together, these findings suggest that fusion events involving the endogenous endosomal secretory machinery increase the pathogenic potential and the radius of action of pathogenic cargoes carried by exogenous exosomes.

Sci Rep	2018	Circulating miRNAs are detected in extracellular space and body fluids such as urine. Circulating RNAs can be packaged in secreted urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) and thus protected from degradation. Urinary exosome preparations might contain specific miRNAs, relevant as biomarkers in renal and bladder diseases. Major difficulties in application of uEVs into the clinical environment are the high variability and low reproducibility of uEV isolation methods. Here we used five different methods to isolate uEVs and compared the size distribution, morphology, yield, presence of exosomal protein markers and RNA content of uEVs. We present an optimized ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography approach for highly reproducible isolation for 50-150 nm uEVs, corresponding to the exosomes, from 50 ml urine. We profiled the miRNA content of uEVs and total urine from the same samples with the NanoString platform and validated the data using qPCR. Our results indicate that 18 miRNAs, robustly detected in uEVs were always present in the total urine. However, 15 miRNAs could be detected only in the total urine preparations and might represent naked circulating miRNA species. This is a novel unbiased and reproducible strategy for uEVs isolation, content normalization and miRNA cargo analysis, suitable for biomarker discovery studies.	PMC5834546

Aβ42 Protofibrils Interact with and Are Trafficked through Microglial-Derived Microvesicles.	ACS Chem Neurosci	2018	Microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes comprise a class of cell-secreted particles termed extracellular vesicles (EVs). These cargo-holding vesicles mediate cell-to-cell communication and have recently been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The two types of EVs are distinguished by the mechanism of cell release and their size, with the smaller exosomes and the larger MVs ranging from 30 to 100 nm and 100 nm to 1 μm in diameter, respectively. MV numbers are increased in AD and appear to interact with amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), the primary protein component of the neuritic plaques in the AD brain. Because microglial cells play such an important role in AD-linked neuroinflammation, we sought to characterize MVs shed from microglial cells, better understand MV interactions with Aβ, and determine whether internalized Aβ may be incorporated into secreted MVs. Multiple strategies were used to characterize MVs shed from BV-2 microglia after ATP stimulation. Confocal images of isolated MVs bound to fluorescently labeled annexin-V via externalized phosphatidylserine revealed a polydisperse population of small spherical structures. Dynamic light scattering measurements yielded MV diameters ranging from 150 to 600 nm. Electron microscopy of resin-embedded MVs cut into thin slices showed well-defined uranyl acetate-stained ring-like structures in a similar diameter range. The use of a fluorescently labeled membrane insertion probe, NBD C6-HPC, effectively tracked MVs in binding experiments, and an Aβ ELISA confirmed a strong interaction between MVs and Aβ protofibrils but not Aβ monomers. Despite the lesser monomer interaction, MVs had an inhibitory effect on monomer aggregation. Primary microglia rapidly internalized Aβ protofibrils, and subsequent stimulation of the microglia with ATP resulted in the release of MVs containing the internalized Aβ protofibrils. The role of MVs in neurodegeneration and inflammation is an emerging area, and further knowledge of MV interaction with Aβ may shed light on extracellular spread and influence on neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation.

Identification of Exosomal miRNAs in Rats With Pulmonary Neutrophilic Inflammation Induced by Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles.	Front Physiol	2018	It has been previously shown that inhaled zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) can modulate inflammation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) enclosed in exosomes have been identified as an important signature for inflammatory responses. However, the role of exosomal miRNAs during pathogenic inflammation has not been investigated. Healthy rats were exposed to ZnO-NPs (41.7 nm; 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg) or saline (control) via oropharyngeal aspiration. ZnO-NPs induced significant increases in the serum levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and elevated the number of cells and the percentage of neutrophils in the blood. Moreover, exposure to ZnO-NPs increased the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Differential profiling of miRNAs in isolated serum exosomes revealed that 16 miRNAs were up-regulated and 7 down-regulated in ZnO-NP-treated rats compared with the controls. Functional and pathway analysis indicated that miRNAs may participate in inflammation directly and indirectly through protein and vesicle-mediated transport or regulation of IL-1, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy. These results suggest that miRNAs in serum exosomes are involved in pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation induced by ZnO-NPs.	PMC5859358

Theriogenology	2018	Exosomes widely exist in various tissues and body fluids, including blood, tissue fluid, and urine. In the present study, exosomes were first isolated from the early luteal phase uterus and confirmed through morphological examination, immunofluorescence (IF) staining of special membrane antigen, and Western blot. The effects of exosomes on the developmental competence of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos were investigated. Transmission electron microscopy results showed that the isolated exsomes were spherical particles with a 50 nm-150 nm diameter. Immunostaining showed that the surface of these isolated particles were CD9 positive, which was confirmed using Western blot. Supplementing SCNT embryos with these isolated exsomes on day 4 of culture significantly increased the blastocyst formation rate (31% vs. 34%, 40.3%, and 34.3%) and hatching rate (30.3% vs. 33.3%, 40.7%, and 35%) in comparison with the non-supplementation (control), and day 3 and day 5 supplementation groups. Blastocysts from the exsome supplementation groups showed higher inner cell mass/trophectoderm cell ratio (48% vs 37.9%) and lower apoptosis index (2.1% vs 6.5%) than the control group. The gene expression analysis of the blastocysts also showed that the exsomes supplementation significantly enhanced the expression levels of IFNT and acrogranin and decreased the expression levels of HSP70, BAX and BIP. In conclusion, the present study indicated that the early luteal phase uterus secretes exosomes, which might play important roles in the development of SCNT embryos.

Identification of RNA-binding proteins in exosomes capable of interacting with different types of RNA: RBP-facilitated transport of RNAs into exosomes.	PLoS One	2018	The RNA that is packaged into exosomes is termed as exosomal-shuttle RNA (esRNA); however, the players, which take this subset of RNA (esRNA) into exosomes, remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) could serve as key players in this mechanism, by making complexes with RNAs and transporting them into exosomes during the biosynthesis of exosomes. Here, we demonstrate the presence of 30 RBPs in exosomes that were shown to form RNA-RBP complexes with both cellular RNA and exosomal-RNA species. To assess the involvement of these RBPs in RNA-transfer into exosomes, the gene transcripts encoding six of the proteins identified in exosomes (HSP90AB1, XPO5, hnRNPH1, hnRNPM, hnRNPA2B1, and MVP) were silenced by siRNA and subsequent effect on esRNA was assessed. A significant reduction of total esRNA was observed by post-transcriptional silencing of MVP, compared to other RBPs. Furthermore, to confirm the binding of MVP with esRNA, a biotinylated-MVP was transiently expressed in HEK293F cells. Higher levels of esRNA were recovered from MVP that was eluted from exosomes of transfected cells, as compared to those of non-transfected cells. Our data indicate that these RBPs could end up in exosomes together with RNA molecules in the form of RNA-ribonucleoprotein complexes, which could be important for the transport of RNAs into exosomes and the maintenance of RNAs inside exosomes. This type of maintenance may favor the shuttling of RNAs from exosomes to recipient cells in the form of stable complexes.	PMC5918169

Int J Biochem Cell Biol	2018	Circulating miRNAs have recently emerged as attractive candidates for biomarker discovery. However, they have a variant distribution in circulation, and the diagnostic significance of their compartmentalization is yet to be elucidated. This study explored the time-course expression profile and the diagnostic potential of miRNAs-122a-5p, 192-5p, 193a-3p and 194-5p in exosomal and total serum compartments in two rat models of acute liver injury (ALI)1. Exosomes were isolated and characterized in terms of morphology, size and CD-63 surface marker expression. Exosomal, serum and hepatic miRNAs were quantified using q-RT-PCR. An inverse expression pattern of hepatic and total serum miRNAs was observed following acetaminophen or thioacetamide-induced liver injury. Conversely, exosomal miRNAs expression pattern varied according to the type of injury. Overall, ROC analysis revealed superior discriminatory ability of exosomal miRNA-122a-5p following either acetaminophen or thioacetamide injury with earlier diagnostic potential and a wider diagnostic window compared to the corresponding total serum counterpart. Moreover, exosomal miRNAs showed higher correlation with ALT activity in both models. In conclusion, exosomal miRNA-122a-5p shows higher diagnostic performance with a broader diagnostic time window and an earlier diagnostic potential than its serum counterpart in ALI. Furthermore, exosomal miRNAs-122a-5p, 192-5p and 193a-3p exhibit an injury-specific signature in ALI and can be used not only as diagnostic tools in liver injury but also to differentiate between different etiologies of injury.

Biomaterials	2018	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a degenerative lethal, X-linked disease of skeletal and cardiac muscles caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Cell therapy using different cell types, including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), has been considered as a potential approach for the treatment of DMD. MSCs can be obtained from autologous sources such as bone marrow and adipose tissues or from allogeneic placenta and umbilical cord. The safety and therapeutic impact of these cells has been demonstrated in pre-clinical and clinical studies and their functions are attributed to paracrine effects that are mediated by secreted cytokines and extracellular vesicles. Here, we studied the therapeutic effects of placenta-derived MSCs (PL-MSCs) and their secreted exosomes using mouse and human myoblasts from healthy controls, Duchenne patients and mdx mice. Treatment of myoblasts with conditioned medium or exosomes secreted by PL-MSCs increased the differentiation of these cells and decreased the expression of fibrogenic genes in DMD patient myoblasts. In addition, these treatments also increased the expression of utrophin in these cells. Using a quantitative miR-29c reporter, we demonstrated that the PL-MSC effects were partly mediated by the transfer of exosomal miR-29c. Intramuscular transplantation of PL-MSCs in mdx mice resulted in decreased creatine kinase levels. PL-MSCs significantly decreased the expression of TGF-β and the level of fibrosis in the diaphragm and cardiac muscles, inhibited inflammation and increased utrophin expression. In vivo imaging analyses using MSCs labeled with gold nanoparticles or fluorescent dyes demonstrated localization of the cells in the muscle tissues up to 3 weeks post treatment. Altogether, these results demonstrate that PL-MSCs and their secreted exosomes have important clinical applications in cell therapy of DMD partly via the targeted delivery of exosomal miR-29c.

Spontaneous membrane transfer through homotypic synapses between lymphoma cells.	J Immunol	2003	Formation of an immunological synapse by T, B, or NK cells is associated with an intercellular transfer of some membrane fragments from their respective target cells. This capture is thought to require effector cell activation by surface recognition of stimulatory ligand(s). However, spontaneous synaptic transfers between homotypic lymphoid cells has never been described. In this study, we show that without adding Ag, resting healthy lymphoid cells and several tumor cell lines are inactive. Conversely, however, some leukemia cell lines including the Burkitt's lymphoma Daudi continuously uptake patches of autologous cell membranes. This intercellular transfer does not involve cytosol molecules or exosomes, but requires cell contact. In homotypic Daudi cell conjugates, this occurs through immunological synapses, involves constitutive protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase activity and strongly increases upon B cell receptor activation. Thus, spontaneous homosynaptic transfer may reflect the hitherto unsuspected autoreactivity of some leukemia cell lines.

Exosomes isolated from culture supernatants of Mo-DCs (>90% purity) were purified with anti-HLA-DP, -DQ, -DR-coated paramagnetic beads. Purified exosomes prolonged the survival of naive CD4+ T cells (>98% purity) in vitro. Treatment with neutralizing mAb against HLA-DR significantly decreased the supportive effect of purified exosomes on CD4+ T cell survival. Exosomes increased nuclear translocation of NF-(kappa)B in naive CD4+ T cells, and NF-(kappa)B activation was significantly suppressed by anti-HLA-DR mAb or NF-(kappa)B inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). In addition, PDTC inhibited the effect of exosomes on naive CD4+ T cell survival. Thus, exosomes secreted by Mo-DCs appear to support naive CD4+ T cell survival via NF-(kappa)B activation induced by interaction of HLA-DR and TCRs.

Dendritic cell-derived exosomes stimulate stronger CD8+ CTL responses and antitumor immunity than tumor cell-derived exosomes.	Cell Mol Immunol	2006	Exosomes (EXO) derived from dendritic cells (DC) and tumor cells have been used to stimulate antitumor immune responses in animal models and in clinical trials. However, there has been no side-by-side comparison of the stimulatory efficiency of the antitumor immune responses induced by these two commonly used EXO vaccines. In this study, we selected to study the phenotype characteristics of EXO derived from a transfected EG7 tumor cells expressing ovalbumin (OVA) and OVA-pulsed DC by flow cytometry. We compared the stimulatory effect in induction of OVA-specific immune responses between these two types of EXO. We found that OVA protein-pulsed DCOVA-derived EXO (EXODC) can more efficiently stimulate naïve OVA-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation and differentiation into cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vivo, and induce more efficient antitumor immunity than EG7 tumor cell-derived EXO (EXOEG7). In addition, we elucidated the important role of the host DC in EXO vaccines that the stimulatory effect of EXO is delivered to T cell responses by the host DC. Therefore, DC-derived EXO may represent a more effective EXO-based vaccine in induction of antitumor immunity.	
17641064	Charlotte Admyre	Department of Medicine, Clinical Allergy Research Unit, Karolinska Institutet and University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. 	charlotte.admyre@ki.se		Exosomes with immune modulatory features are present in human breast milk.	J Immunol	2007	Breast milk is a complex liquid with immune-competent cells and soluble proteins that provide immunity to the infant and affect the maturation of the infant's immune system. Exosomes are nanovesicles (30-100 nm) with an endosome-derived limiting membrane secreted by a diverse range of cell types. Because exosomes carry immunorelevant structures, they are suggested to participate in directing the immune response. We hypothesized that human breast milk contain exosomes, which may be important for the development of the infant's immune system. We isolated vesicles from the human colostrum and mature breast milk by ultracentrifugations and/or immuno-isolation on paramagnetic beads. We found that the vesicles displayed a typical exosome-like size and morphology as analyzed by electron microscopy. Furthermore, they floated at a density between 1.10 and 1.18 g/ml in a sucrose gradient, corresponding to the known density of exosomes. In addition, MHC classes I and II, CD63, CD81, and CD86 were detected on the vesicles by flow cytometry. Western blot and mass spectrometry further confirmed the presence of several exosome-associated molecules. Functional analysis revealed that the vesicle preparation inhibited anti-CD3-induced IL-2 and IFN-gamma production from allogeneic and autologous PBMC. In addition, an increased number of Foxp3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) T regulatory cells were observed in PBMC incubated with milk vesicle preparations. We conclude that human breast milk contains exosomes with the capacity to influence immune responses.	
18490724	Aled Clayton	Department of Oncology and Palliative Medicine, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Velindre Cancer Centre, Whitchurch, Cardiff, United Kingdom. 	aled.clayton@velindre-tr.wales.nhs.uk		Human tumor-derived exosomes down-modulate NKG2D expression.	J Immunol	2008	NKG2D is an activating receptor for NK, NKT, CD8(+), and gammadelta(+) T cells, whose aberrant loss in cancer is a key mechanism of immune evasion. Soluble NKG2D ligands and growth factors, such as TGFbeta1 emanating from tumors, are mechanisms for down-regulating NKG2D expression. Cancers thereby impair the capacity of lymphocytes to recognize and destroy them. In this study, we show that exosomes derived from cancer cells express ligands for NKG2D and express TGFbeta1, and we investigate the impact of such exosomes on CD8(+) T and NK cell NKG2D expression and on NKG2D-dependent functions. Exosomes produced by various cancer cell lines in vitro, or isolated from pleural effusions of mesothelioma patients triggered down-regulation of surface NKG2D expression by NK cells and CD8(+) T cells. This decrease was rapid, sustained, and resulted from direct interactions between exosomes and NK cells or CD8(+) T cells. Other markers (CD4, CD8, CD56, CD16, CD94, or CD69) remained unchanged, indicating the selectivity and nonactivatory nature of the response. Exosomal NKG2D ligands were partially responsible for this effect, as down-modulation of NKG2D was slightly attenuated in the presence of MICA-specific Ab. In contrast, TGFbeta1-neutralizing Ab strongly abrogated NKG2D down-modulation, suggesting exosomally expressed TGFbeta as the principal mechanism. Lymphocyte effector function was impaired by pretreatment with tumor exosomes, as these cells exhibited poor NKG2D-dependent production of IFN-gamma and poor NKG2D-dependent killing function. This hyporesponsiveness was evident even in the presence of IL-15, a strong inducer of NKG2D. Our data show that NKG2D is a likely physiological target for exosome-mediated immune evasion in cancer.

Methods Mol Biol	2009	Membranous vesicles are constitutively released by a multitude of cell types. Following fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane, endocytic vesicles, 30-90 nm in size termed exosomes are released extracellularly. Whilst several groups have reported the presence of exosomes in cell-culture conditioned medium, their biological and physiological functions still remain unclear. In addition, exosomes have been detected in body fluids associated with disease, further demonstrating their potential as diagnostic biomarkers. This protocol employs size filtration followed by ultracentrifugation to isolate and purify exosomes from the colon carcinoma cell line LIM 1215. Morphological visualisation and characterisation is based on electron microscopy and western blotting, whilst protein identification is achieved using a combination of 1D SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS.

Exosomes from human saliva as a source of microRNA biomarkers.	Oral Dis	2010	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the presence of microRNAs (miRNAs) within exosomes isolated from human saliva and to optimize and test methods for successful downstream applications. DESIGN: Exosomes isolated from fresh and frozen glandular and whole human saliva were used as a source of miRNAs. The presence of miRNAs was validated with TaqMan quantitative PCR and miRNA microarrays. RESULTS: We successfully isolated exosomes from human saliva from healthy controls and a patient with Sjögren's syndrome. microRNAs extracted from the exosomal fraction were sufficient for quantitative PCR and microarray profiling. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of miRNAs from easily and non-invasively obtained salivary exosomes with subsequent characterization of the miRNA expression patterns is promising for the development of future biomarkers of the diagnosis and prognosis of various salivary gland pathologies.

Contribution of MyD88 to the tumor exosome-mediated induction of myeloid derived suppressor cells.	Am J Pathol	2010	In this study we observed that mice pretreated with tumor exosomes had a significant acceleration of tumor metastasis in the lung. Tumor metastasis correlated significantly with an increase in recruitment of more Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the lung of C57BL/6j (B6) mice pretreated with tumor exosomes. These effects were blunted when MyD88 knockout (KO) mice were pretreated with tumor exosomes. MDSCs induced by tumor exosomes and isolated from wild-type B6 mice also more potently inhibited T cell activation and induction of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha than MDSCs isolated from the lung of MyD88 KO mice. In vitro, addition of tumor exosomes to bone marrow-derived CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) cells isolated from wild-type B6 mice resulted in more cytokine production, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and the chemokine CCL2, than CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) cells isolated from MyD88 KO mice. Moreover, lower levels of CCL2 were observed in the lungs in MyD88 KO mice pretreated with tumor exosomes than that in wild-type mice. Together these data demonstrate a pivotal role for MyD88 in tumor exosome-mediated expansion of MDSCs and tumor metastasis.	PMC2861113

Exosomes derived from immature bone marrow dendritic cells induce tolerogenicity of intestinal transplantation in rats.	J Surg Res	2011	BACKGROUND: Dendritic cells (DCs) secrete exosomes bearing major histocompatibility complex I and II (MHC I /II) and co-stimulatory molecules, and play a critical role in immune regulation. Because immature DCs can induce T-cell tolerance in vitro and in vivo, we explored the possibility of using exosomes derived from immature DCs (imDex) for the induction of intestinal transplant tolerance in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ImDex were purified from F344 rat bone marrow immature DCs. The tolerizing capacities of imDex were analyzed in vitro and in vivo using a F344-to-Wistar intestinal transplantation model. RESULTS: In the context of a moderate level of MHC class II and a low co-stimulatory level expression, imDex significantly suppressed the alloreactive T-cell response with an increase in IL-10 in vitro. In vivo injection of the lower dose (20 μg) of donor (but not recipient) imDex can significantly prolong the survival of intestinal allografts. This effect was accompanied by a decrease in the anti-donor cellular response, with a significant increase in IL-10. The CD4+CD25+T cells percentage and FOXP3mRNA expression in splenic T-cells were also significantly increased in imDex treatment recipients at five days after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that imDex can prolong the intestinal allograft survival and may be a potential strategy to facilitate induction of transplant tolerance.

Exosomes in the ascites of ovarian cancer patients: origin and effects on anti-tumor immunity.	Oncol Rep	2011	This study was performed to identify the origin of the ascites-derived exosomes from patients with ovarian cancer and to observe the effect of exosomes on anti-tumor immunity. Exosomes were isolated from the ascites of patients with ovarian epithelial cancer by ultracentrifugation plus density gradient centrifugation. The origin of exosomes was identified by immunoelectronmicroscopy (IEM). The growth curve of the tumor cell line SKOV3 cultured with or without exosomes was analyzed. The apoptosis of autogeneic tumor cells (ATCs) and SKOV3 cells affected by exosomes was measured by flow cytometry (FCM) and light phase contrast microscopy. The cytotoxic effect of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated by exosomes and/or dendritic cells (DCs) on ovarian cancer cells was measured using a CCK-8 assay. The levels of IFN-γ released by PBMCs stimulated by exosomes and/or DCs were measured by ELISA. The apoptosis of PBMCs and DCs affected by exosomes was measured by FCM and light microscopy. Whether the mature process of DCs was affected by exosomes was studied by FCM. The ratio of CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell were measured by FCM. FasL and TRAIL molecules on exosomes were detected by western blot analysis. The human FasL antagonistic antibody was used to block the apoptosis of DCs and PBMCs induced by exosomes. The receptors of TRAIL DR4 and DR5 on PBMCs and DCs were detected by FCM. In 41 patients examined, we isolated exosomes from the ascites of 35 patients. We detected TCR, CD20, HLA-DR, B7-2, HER2/neu, CA125 and Histone H2A on exosomes. We found that exosomes might impair the cytotoxic activity of PBMCs when DCs are present. We found that exosomes had no effect on the growth and apoptosis of SKOV3 cells. However, exosomes may induce apoptosis of precursors, mature DCs and PBMCs. We found that FasL and TRAIL were present in the exosome suspension and addition of an anti-FasL antibody may decrease the percentage of apoptosis of DCs and PBMCs. We conclude that exosomes exist in ascites of 85.4% of patients with ovarian cancer. Moreover, these exosomes may be of multi-origin. Exosomes had no effect on the growth and apoptosis of tumor cells but impaired the cytotoxic activity of PBMCs in the presence of DCs. Exosomes also may induce apoptosis of the precursors of DCs, DCs and PBMCs. FasL and TRAIL on exosomes may partly account for the apoptosis of cells of the immune system.

Proteomic analysis of urinary exosomes from patients of early IgA nephropathy and thin basement membrane nephropathy.	Proteomics	2011	To identify biomarker candidates associated with early IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN), the most common causes presenting isolated hematuria in childhood, a proteomic approach of urinary exosomes from early IgAN and TBMN patients was introduced. The proteomic results from the patients were compared with a normal group to understand the pathophysiological processes associated with these diseases at the protein level. The urinary exosomes, which reflect pathophysiological processes, collected from three groups of young adults (early IgAN, TBMN, and normal) were trypsin-digested using a gel-assisted protocol, and quantified by label-free LC-MS/MS, using an MS(E) mode. A total of 1877 urinary exosome proteins, including cytoplasmic, membrane, and vesicle trafficking proteins, were identified. Among the differentially expressed proteins, four proteins (aminopeptidase N, vasorin precursor, α-1-antitrypsin, and ceruloplasmin) were selected as biomarker candidates to differentiate early IgAN from TBMN. We confirmed the protein levels of the four biomarker candidates by semi-quantitative immunoblot analysis in urinary exosomes independently prepared from other patients, including older adult groups. Further clinical studies are needed to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of these urinary markers for early IgAN and TBMN. Taken together, this study showed the possibility of identifying biomarker candidates for human urinary diseases using urinary exosomes and might help to understand the pathophysiology of early IgAN and TBMN at the protein level.

Epitope-tagged Pkhd1 tracks the processing, secretion, and localization of fibrocystin.	J Am Soc Nephrol	2011	Mutations in the PKHD1 gene, which encodes fibrocystin, cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Unfortunately, the lack of specific antibodies to the mouse protein impairs the study of splicing, post-translational processing, shedding, and temporal and spatial expression of endogenous fibrocystin at the cellular and subcellular level. Here, we report using a knock-in strategy to generate a null Pkhd1 strain and a strain that expresses fibrocystin along with two SV5-Pk epitope tags engineered in-frame into the third exon, immediately C-terminal to the signal-peptide cleavage site in a poorly conserved region. By 6 mo of age, the Pkhd1-null mouse develops massive cystic hepatomegaly and proximal tubule dilation, whereas the mouse with epitope-tagged fibrocystin has histologically normal liver and kidneys at 14 mo. Although Pkhd1 was believed to generate many splice forms, our western analysis resolved fibrocystin as a 500 kD product without other forms in the 15-550 kD range. Western analysis also revealed that exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) secrete the bulk of fibrocystin in its mature cleaved form, and scanning electron microscopy identified that fibrocystin on ELVs attached to cilia. Furthermore, the addition of ELVs with epitope-tagged fibrocystin to wild-type cells showed that label transferred to primary cilia within 5 min. In summary, tagging of the endogenous Pkhd1 gene facilitates the study of the glycosylation, proteolytic cleavage, and shedding of fibrocystin.	PMC3250208

Proteomic analysis of exosome-like vesicles derived from breast cancer cells.	Anticancer Res	2012	BACKGROUND/AIM: The phenomenon of membrane vesicle-release by neoplastic cells is a growing field of interest in cancer research, due to their potential role in carrying a large array of tumor antigens when secreted into the extracellular medium. In particular, experimental evidence show that at least some of the tumor markers detected in the blood circulation of mammary carcinoma patients are carried by membrane-bound vesicles. Thus, biomarker research in breast cancer can gain great benefits from vesicle characterization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conditioned medium was collected from serum starved MDA-MB-231 sub-confluent cell cultures and exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Ultrastructural analysis of ELVs was performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the purity of fraction was confirmed by western blotting assays. Proteomic profile of ELVs was carried out by 2 D-PAGE and protein identification performed by MALDI-ToF Mass Spectrometry. RESULTS: On the basis of ultrastructural and immunological characterization, the isolated vesicles have been classified as exosome-like vesicles (ELVs). The proteomic investigation showed a distinctive protein profile of the ELVs, in comparison to the whole cell lisates (WCL) proteome, which could be instrumental for cancer progression. The proteins were clustered into functional categories, according to the current bioinformatics resources and a Venn diagram was constructed based on these clusters. CONCLUSION: It is reasonable to assume that vesicle production allows neoplastic cells to exert different effects, according to the possible acceptor targets. For instance, vesicles could potentiate the malignant properties of adjacent neoplastic cells or activate non-tumoral cells. Moreover, vesicles could convey signals to immune cells and surrounding stroma cells. The present study may significantly contribute to the knowledge of the vesiculation phenomenon, which is a critical device for trans cellular communication in cancer.

Melanoma exosomes educate bone marrow progenitor cells toward a pro-metastatic phenotype through MET.	Nat Med	2012	Tumor-derived exosomes are emerging mediators of tumorigenesis. We explored the function of melanoma-derived exosomes in the formation of primary tumors and metastases in mice and human subjects. Exosomes from highly metastatic melanomas increased the metastatic behavior of primary tumors by permanently 'educating' bone marrow progenitors through the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Melanoma-derived exosomes also induced vascular leakiness at pre-metastatic sites and reprogrammed bone marrow progenitors toward a pro-vasculogenic phenotype that was positive for c-Kit, the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 and Met. Reducing Met expression in exosomes diminished the pro-metastatic behavior of bone marrow cells. Notably, MET expression was elevated in circulating CD45(-)C-KIT(low/+)TIE2(+) bone marrow progenitors from individuals with metastatic melanoma. RAB1A, RAB5B, RAB7 and RAB27A, regulators of membrane trafficking and exosome formation, were highly expressed in melanoma cells. Rab27A RNA interference decreased exosome production, preventing bone marrow education and reducing, tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, we identified an exosome-specific melanoma signature with prognostic and therapeutic potential comprised of TYRP2, VLA-4, HSP70, an HSP90 isoform and the MET oncoprotein. Our data show that exosome production, transfer and education of bone marrow cells supports tumor growth and metastasis, has prognostic value and offers promise for new therapeutic directions in the metastatic process.

Exosome-mediated shuttling of microRNA-29 regulates HIV Tat and morphine-mediated neuronal dysfunction.	Cell Death Dis	2012	Neuronal damage is a hallmark feature of HIV-associated neurological disorders (HANDs). Opiate drug abuse accelerates the incidence and progression of HAND; however, the mechanisms underlying the potentiation of neuropathogenesis by these drugs remain elusive. Opiates such as morphine have been shown to enhance HIV transactivation protein Tat-mediated toxicity in both human neurons and neuroblastoma cells. In the present study, we demonstrate reduced expression of the tropic factor platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B with a concomitant increase in miR-29b in the basal ganglia region of the brains of morphine-dependent simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques compared with the SIV-infected controls. In vitro relevance of these findings was corroborated in cultures of astrocytes exposed to morphine and HIV Tat that led to increased release of miR-29b in exosomes. Subsequent treatment of neuronal SH-SY5Y cell line with exosomes from treated astrocytes resulted in decreased expression of PDGF-B, with a concomitant decrease in viability of neurons. Furthermore, it was shown that PDGF-B was a target for miR-29b as evidenced by the fact that binding of miR-29 to the 3'-untranslated region of PDGF-B mRNA resulted in its translational repression in SH-SY5Y cells. Understanding the regulation of PDGF-B expression may provide insights into the development of potential therapeutic targets for neuronal loss in HIV-1-infected opiate abusers.	PMC3434655

Proteomic analysis of exosomes from mutant KRAS colon cancer cells identifies intercellular transfer of mutant KRAS.	Mol Cell Proteomics	2013	Activating mutations in KRAS occur in 30% to 40% of colorectal cancers. How mutant KRAS alters cancer cell behavior has been studied intensively, but non-cell autonomous effects of mutant KRAS are less understood. We recently reported that exosomes isolated from mutant KRAS-expressing colon cancer cells enhanced the invasiveness of recipient cells relative to exosomes purified from wild-type KRAS-expressing cells, leading us to hypothesize mutant KRAS might affect neighboring and distant cells by regulating exosome composition and behavior. Herein, we show the results of a comprehensive proteomic analysis of exosomes from parental DLD-1 cells that contain both wild-type and G13D mutant KRAS alleles and isogenically matched derivative cell lines, DKO-1 (mutant KRAS allele only) and DKs-8 (wild-type KRAS allele only). Mutant KRAS status dramatically affects the composition of the exosome proteome. Exosomes from mutant KRAS cells contain many tumor-promoting proteins, including KRAS, EGFR, SRC family kinases, and integrins. DKs-8 cells internalize DKO-1 exosomes, and, notably, DKO-1 exosomes transfer mutant KRAS to DKs-8 cells, leading to enhanced three-dimensional growth of these wild-type KRAS-expressing non-transformed cells. These results have important implications for non-cell autonomous effects of mutant KRAS, such as field effect and tumor progression.	PMC3567858

Immunobiology	2013	The expression of DOβ and not DOα, in addition to the high intracellular DR, low DM levels and absence of surface DR expression in K562 and HL-60 cells introduce alternative regulatory pathways in DR trafficking and consequently the antigen presentation process. The present study attempted to define the naturally occurring DOα negative state and explain the role of DOβ in the intracellular DR accumulation in K562 and HL-60 cells. Despite the absence of DOα, the DOβ chain was detected in the endosomal compartments. The lack of DOα was found to be partially responsible for the absence of DR from the cell membrane since stable K562-DOα transfectants allowed expression of membrane DR. This expression could be significantly increased upon DM induction by IFN-γ, indicating that DM was another limiting factor for the migration of DR to the cell surface of K562 and HL-60 cells. Furthermore, intracellular DR co-localized with the exosome specific marker CD9, while culture supernatants were shown to contain exosome-engaged and exosome free DR activity as evaluated by SDS-page followed by western blot, ELISA and transmission electron microscopy analysis. These findings indicated that in DOα⁻β⁺ cells, DR molecules were programmed to secretion rather than surface expression. The presented results provide novel regulatory processes as to DR trafficking, avoiding expression to the cell surface.

J Biol Chem	2013	The role of exosomes in cancer can be inferred from the observation that they transfer tumor cell derived genetic material and signaling proteins, resulting in e.g. increased tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. However, the membrane transport mechanisms and the signaling events involved in the uptake of these virus-like particles remain ill-defined. We now report that internalization of exosomes derived from glioblastoma (GBM) cells involves nonclassical, lipid raft-dependent endocytosis. Importantly, we show that the lipid raft-associated protein caveolin-1 (CAV1), in analogy with its previously described role in virus uptake, negatively regulates the uptake of exosomes. We find that exosomes induce the phosphorylation of several downstream targets known to associate with lipid rafts as signaling and sorting platforms, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). Interestingly, exosome uptake appears dependent on unperturbed ERK1/2-HSP27 signaling, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation is under negative influence by CAV1 during internalization of exosomes. These findings significantly advance our general understanding of exosome-mediated uptake and offer potential strategies for how this pathway may be targeted through modulation of CAV1 expression and ERK1/2 signaling.

Exosomes mediate the cell-to-cell transmission of IFN-α-induced antiviral activity.	Nat Immunol	2013	The cell-to-cell transmission of viral resistance is a potential mechanism for amplifying the interferon-induced antiviral response. In this study, we report that interferon-α (IFN-α) induced the transfer of resistance to hepatitis B virus (HBV) from nonpermissive liver nonparenchymal cells (LNPCs) to permissive hepatocytes via exosomes. Exosomes from IFN-α-treated LNPCs were rich in molecules with antiviral activity. Moreover, exosomes from LNPCs were internalized by hepatocytes, which mediated the intercellular transfer of antiviral molecules. Finally, we found that exosomes also contributed to the antiviral response of IFN-α to mouse hepatitis virus A59 and adenovirus in mice. Thus, we propose an antiviral mechanism of IFN-α activity that involves the induction and intercellular transfer of antiviral molecules via exosomes.

Cellular stress conditions are reflected in the protein and RNA content of endothelial cell-derived exosomes.	J Extracell Vesicles	2012	BACKGROUND: The healthy vascular endothelium, which forms the barrier between blood and the surrounding tissues, is known to efficiently respond to stress signals like hypoxia and inflammation by adaptation of cellular physiology and the secretion of (soluble) growth factors and cytokines. Exosomes are potent mediators of intercellular communication. Their content consists of RNA and proteins from the cell of origin, and thus depends on the condition of these cells at the time of exosome biogenesis. It has been suggested that exosomes protect their target cells from cellular stress through the transfer of RNA and proteins. We hypothesized that endothelium-derived exosomes are involved in the endothelial response to cellular stress, and that exosome RNA and protein content reflect the effects of cellular stress induced by hypoxia, inflammation or hyperglycemia. METHODS: We exposed cultured endothelial cells to different types of cellular stress (hypoxia, TNF-α-induced activation, high glucose and mannose concentrations) and compared mRNA and protein content of exosomes produced by these cells by microarray analysis and a quantitative proteomics approach. RESULTS: We identified 1,354 proteins and 1,992 mRNAs in endothelial cell-derived exosomes. Several proteins and mRNAs showed altered abundances after exposure of their producing cells to cellular stress, which were confirmed by immunoblot or qPCR analysis. CONCLUSION: Our data show that hypoxia and endothelial activation are reflected in RNA and protein exosome composition, and that exposure to high sugar concentrations alters exosome protein composition only to a minor extend, and does not affect exosome RNA composition.

PLoS One	2013	Exosomes are small membranous microvesicles (40-100 nm in diameter) and are extracellularly released from a wide variety of cells. Exosomes contain microRNA, mRNA, and cellular proteins, which are delivered into recipient cells via these exosomes, and play a role in intercellular communication. In bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection of cattle, although it is thought to be a minor route of infection, BLV can be transmitted to calves via milk. Here, we investigated the association between exosomes and BLV in bovine milk. BLV structural proteins, gp51 (Env) and p24 (Gag), were detected in bovine milk exosomes from BLV-infected cattle by Western blot analysis. In cells inoculated with these milk exosomes, BLV DNA was not detected during three serial passages by nested PCR. Purification of exosomes from persistently BLV-infected cells was achieved by immuno-magnetic separation using an antibody against exosomes coupled to magnetic beads. Consistently, BLV gp51 and p24 proteins were detected in purified exosomes. Moreover, reverse transcriptase activity was observed in purified exosomes, meaning that exosomes also contain viral enzyme. However, BLV DNA was not detected in serially passaged cells after inoculation of purified exosomes, indicating that exosomes carrying BLV proteins appeared to be not infectious. These results suggest that BLV proteins are released with milk exosomes and could be transferred into recipient cells of calves via milk exosomes as an alternative route not requiring virus infection. Moreover it is also possible that bovine milk exosomes play a role in clearance of BLV proteins from infected cells.	PMC3798320

Extracellular vesicles derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells promote angiogenesis in a rat myocardial infarction model.	J Mol Med (Berl)	2014	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been increasingly tested experimentally and clinically for cardiac repair. However, the underlying mechanisms remain controversial due to the poor viability and considerable death of the engrafted cells in the infracted myocardium. Recent reports have suggested that extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by MSCs have angiogenesis-promoting activity; however, the therapeutic effect of MSC-EVs on an ischemic heart is unclear. In the present study, we reported that MSCs could release a large quantity of EVs around 100 nm in diameter upon hypoxia stimulation though the majority of the cells had not experienced apoptosis. MSC-EVs could be promptly uptaken by human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and the internalization resulted in dose-dependent enhancement of in vitro proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells. Using an acute myocardial infarction rat model, we found that intramyocardial injection of MSC-EVs markedly enhanced blood flow recovery, in accordance with reduced infarct size and preserved cardiac systolic and diastolic performance compared to those treated with PBS. These data suggest that like MSCs, MSC-EVs could also protect cardiac tissue from ischemic injury at least by means of promoting blood vessel formation, though further detailed investigations should be performed to define the functionality of MSC-EVs. KEY MESSAGES: MSCs released extracellular vesicles (EVs) upon hypoxia stimulation. MSC-EVs were a mixture of microvesicles and exosomes. MSC-EVs could be promptly uptaken by human umbilical vein endothelial cells. MSC-EVs promoted neoangiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. MSC-EVs preserved cardiac performance in an AMI model.

Electronic address: .	peter.ferdinandy@pharmahungary.com		Cardioprotection by remote ischemic preconditioning of the rat heart is mediated by extracellular vesicles.	J Mol Cell Cardiol	2014	Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) of the heart is exerted by brief ischemic insults affected on a remote organ or a remote area of the heart before a sustained cardiac ischemia. To date, little is known about the inter-organ transfer mechanisms of cardioprotection by RIPC. Exosomes and microvesicles/microparticles are vesicles of 30-100 nm and 100-1000 nm in diameter, respectively (collectively termed extracellular vesicles [EVs]). Their content of proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs, renders EV ideal conveyors of inter-organ communication. However, whether EVs are involved in RIPC, is unknown. Therefore, here we investigated whether (1) IPC induces release of EVs from the heart, and (2) EVs are necessary for cardioprotection by RIPC. Hearts of male Wistar rats were isolated and perfused in Langendorff mode. A group of donor hearts was exposed to 3 × 5-5 min global ischemia and reperfusion (IPC) or 30 min aerobic perfusion, while coronary perfusates were collected. Coronary perfusates of these hearts were given to another set of recipient isolated hearts. A group of recipient hearts received IPC effluent depleted of EVs by differential ultracentrifugation. Infarct size was determined after 30 min global ischemia and 120 min reperfusion. The presence or absence of EVs in perfusates was confirmed by dynamic light scattering, the EV marker HSP60 Western blot, and electron microscopy. IPC markedly increased EV release from the heart as assessed by HSP60. Administration of coronary perfusate from IPC donor hearts attenuated infarct size in non-preconditioned recipient hearts (12.9 ± 1.6% vs. 25.0 ± 2.7%), similarly to cardioprotection afforded by IPC (7.3 ± 2.7% vs. 22.1 ± 2.9%) on the donor hearts. Perfusates of IPC hearts depleted of EVs failed to exert cardioprotection in recipient hearts (22.0 ± 2.3%). This is the first demonstration that EVs released from the heart after IPC are necessary for cardioprotection by RIPC, evidencing the importance of vesicular transfer mechanisms in remote cardioprotection.

Characterization of uptake and internalization of exosomes by bladder cancer cells.	Biomed Res Int	2014	Bladder tumors represent a special therapeutic challenge as they have a high recurrence rate requiring repeated interventions and may progress to invasive or metastatic disease. Exosomes carry proteins implicated in bladder cancer progression and have been implicated in bladder cancer cell survival. Here, we characterized exosome uptake and internalization by human bladder cancer cells using Amnis ImageStreamX, an image cytometer. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation from bladder cancer culture conditioned supernatant, labeled with PKH-26, and analyzed on the ImageStreamX with an internal standard added to determine concentration. Exosomes were cocultured with bladder cancer cells and analyzed for internalization. Using the IDEAS software, we determined exosome uptake based on the number of PKH-26+ spots and overall PKH-26 fluorescence intensity. Using unlabeled beads of a known concentration and size, we were able to determine concentrations of exosomes isolated from bladder cancer cells. We measured exosome uptake by recipient bladder cancer cells, and we demonstrated that uptake is dose and time dependent. Finally, we found that uptake is active and specific, which can be partially blocked by heparin treatment. The characterization of cellular uptake and internalization by bladder cancer cells may shed light on the role of exosomes on bladder cancer recurrence and progression.	PMC3915764

Improvement of cloned embryos development by co-culturing with parthenotes: a possible role of exosomes/microvesicles for embryos paracrine communication.	Cell Reprogram	2014	It is well known that embryos cultured in a group can create a microenvironment through secretion of autocrine and paracrine factors that can support and improve the embryos' development when compared to the embryos cultured individually. In this study, we used a co-culture system for paracrine communication between different kinds of embryos. The results showed that co-culture of porcine parthenogenetic (PA) embryos significantly improved the in vitro development of cloned (nuclear transfer, NT) embryos. To reveal the possible mechanism of communication between the two groups, we isolated exosomes/microvesicles (EXs/MVs) from the PA embryos conditioned medium (PA-CM) through differential centrifugation and identified them through transmission electron microscope and immunoflourescence against exosomal/membrane marker CD9. Furthermore, these EXs/MVs were found to contain mRNA of pluripotency genes (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, and Nanog), and the PKH67-labeled EXs/MVs could be internalized by the NT embryos. The current study demonstrates that cloned embryos' developmental competence can be improved through co-culturing with PA embryos and revealed, for the first time, that in vitro-produced embryos can secrete EXs/MVs as a possible communication tool within their microenvironment. Moreover, it provides a new paradigm for embryo-to-embryo communication in vitro.	PMC4030698

Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) are present in fractions related to exosomes released by EBV-transformed cells.	PLoS One	2014	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus associated with a number of human malignancies of epithelial and lymphoid origin. However, the mechanism of oncogenesis is unclear. A number of viral products, including EBV latent proteins and non-protein coding RNAs have been implicated. Recently it was reported that EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) are released from EBV infected cells and they can induce biological changes in cells via signaling from toll-like receptor 3. Here, we investigated if these abundantly expressed non-protein coding EBV RNAs (EBER-1 and EBER-2) are excreted from infected cells in exosomal fractions. Using differential ultracentrifugation we isolated exosomes from three EBV positive cell lines (B95-8, EBV-LCL, BL30-B95-8), one EBER-1 transfected cell line (293T-pHEBo-E1) and two EBV-negative cell lines (BL30, 293T-pHEBo). The identity of purified exosomes was determined by electron microscopy and western blotting for CD63. The presence of EBERs in cells, culture supernatants and purified exosomal fractions was determined using RT-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. Purified exosomal fractions were also tested for the presence of the EBER-1-binding protein La, using western blotting. Both EBER-1 and EBER-2 were found to be present not only in the culture supernatants, but also in the purified exosome fractions of all EBV-infected cell lines. EBER-1 could also be detected in exosomal fractions from EBER-1 transfected 293T cells whilst the fractions from vector only transfectants were clearly negative. Furthermore, purified exosomal fractions also contained the EBER-binding protein (La), supporting the notion that EBERs are most probably released from EBV infected cells in the form of EBER-La complex in exosomes.

Anticancer Res	2014	BACKGROUND/AIM: Exosomes have been demonstrated to be useful non-invasive biomarkers for several cancers including prostate cancer. Since normal cells also secrete exosomes, isolation of cancer-derived exosomes from blood is a prerequisite for their better understanding. The aim of this study is to establish the method for isolation of prostate cancer-related exosomes from blood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes were collected from prostate cancer LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines by ultracentrifugation and by using magnetic beads conjugated with anti-CD9 antibody and anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibody. Prostate cancer-related exosomes were also isolated from the plasma of prostate cancer patients by anti-PSMA beads. Isolated exosomes were analyzed by western blotting. RESULTS: Exosomes were isolated from LNCaP cells by ultracentrifugation, contained PSMA and androgen receptor (AR). AR was also detected in exosomes isolated from LNCaP cells by anti-PSMA and anti-CD9 beads, showing that AR is present in prostate cancer-related exosomes. The amount of CD9 in isolated exosomes was much higher in advanced and chemo-resistant prostate cancer patients than in prostate cancer patients without metastasis and healthy volunteers, indicating that patients with aggressive prostate cancer exhibit higher levels of prostate cancer-related exosomes in blood. CONCLUSION: The immunoaffinity-based method we developed is capable of isolating prostate cancer-related exosomes from blood, the use of which will enhance investigation processes on exosomes in prostate cancer.	
25092378	Mitsuo Ochi				Exosomes from IL-1β stimulated synovial fibroblasts induce osteoarthritic changes in articular chondrocytes.	Arthritis Res Ther	2014	INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a whole joint disease, and characterized by progressive degradation of articular cartilage, synovial hyperplasia, bone remodeling and angiogenesis in various joint tissues. Exosomes are a type of microvesicles (MVs) that may play a role in tissue-tissue and cell-cell communication in homeostasis and diseases. We hypothesized that exosomes function in a novel regulatory network that contributes to OA pathogenesis and examined the function of exosomes in communication among joint tissue cells. METHODS: Human synovial fibroblasts (SFB) and articular chondrocytes were obtained from normal knee joints. Exosomes isolated from conditioned medium of SFB were analyzed for size, numbers, markers and function. Normal articular chondrocytes were treated with exosomes from SFB, and Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) stimulated SFB. OA-related genes expression was quantified using real-time PCR. To analyze exosome effects on cartilage tissue, we performed glycosaminoglycan release assay. Angiogenic activity of these exosomes was tested in migration and tube formation assays. Cytokines and miRNAs in exosomes were analyzed by Bio-Plex multiplex assay and NanoString analysis. RESULTS: Exosomes from IL-1β stimulated SFB significantly up-regulated MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 expression in articular chondrocytes, and down-regulated COL2A1 and ACAN compared with SFB derived exosomes. Migration and tube formation activity were significantly higher in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with the exosomes from IL-1β stimulated SFB, which also induced significantly more proteoglycan release from cartilage explants. Inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, MMP-3 and VEGF in exosomes were only detectable at low level. IL-1β, TNFα MMP-9 and MMP-13 were not detectable in exosomes. NanoString analysis showed that levels of 50 miRNAs were differentially expressed in exosomes from IL-1β stimulated SFB compared to non-stimulated SFB. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes from IL-1β stimulated SFB induce OA-like changes both in vitro and in ex vivo models. Exosomes represent a novel mechanism by which pathogenic signals are communicated among different cell types in OA-affected joints.	PMC4261911

Fertil Steril	2014	OBJECTIVE: To characterize well-represented microRNAs in human follicular fluid (FF) and to ascertain whether they are cargo of FF exosomes and whether they are involved in the regulation of follicle maturation. DESIGN: FF exosomes were characterized by nanosight, flow cytometry, and exosome-specific surface markers. Expression microRNA profiles from total and exosomal FF were compared with those from plasma of the same women. SETTING: University laboratory and an IVF center. PATIENT(S): Fifteen healthy women who had undergone intracytoplasmic sperm injection. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): TaqMan low-density array to investigate the expression profile of 384 microRNAs; DataAssist and geNorm for endogenous control identification; significance analysis of microarrays to identify differentially expressed microRNAs; nanosight, flow-cytometry, and bioanalyzer for exosome characterization; bioinformatic tools for microRNAs target prediction, gene ontology, and pathway analysis. RESULT(S): We identified 37 microRNAs upregulated in FF as compared with plasma from the same women. Thirty-two were carried by microvesicles that showed the well-characterized exosomal markers CD63 and CD81. These FF microRNAs are involved in critically important pathways for follicle growth and oocyte maturation. Specifically, nine of them target and negatively regulate mRNAs expressed in the follicular microenvironment encoding inhibitors of follicle maturation and meiosis resumption. CONCLUSION(S): This study identified a series of exosomal microRNAs that are highly represented in human FF and are involved in follicular maturation. They could represent noninvasive biomarkers of oocyte quality in assisted reproductive technology.

Extracellular vesicles in hematological disorders.

Reproduction	2015	Conceptus-endometrial communication during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy ensures establishment of pregnancy. We hypothesized that this dialog involves exosomes, ovine endogenous jaagsiekte retroviruses (enJSRV) and toll-like receptors (TLR) which regulate the secretion of interferon tau (IFNT), the pregnancy recognition signal in ruminants. First, exosomes isolated from uterine flushings from cyclic and pregnant ewes were analyzed for exosomal content and uterine expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSC70). Then, conceptus trophectoderm cells (oTr1) treated with different doses of exosomes were analyzed for the expression of genes involved in TLR-mediated cell signaling. The results revealed that exosomes contain mRNAs for enJSRV-ENV, HSC70, interleukins, and interferon (IFN)-regulatory factors. Exosomal content of enJSRV-ENV mRNA and protein decreased from days 10 and 12 to day 16 of gestation, and uterine expression of HSC70 increased in pregnant ewes compared with cyclic ewes. The oTr1 cells proliferated and secreted IFNT in a dose-dependent manner in response to exosomes from cyclic ewes. The expression of CD14, CD68, IRAK1, TRAF6, IRF6, and IRF7 mRNAs that are key to TLR-mediated expression of type 1 IFNs was significantly influenced by day of pregnancy. This study demonstrated that exosomes are liberated into the uterine lumen during the estrous cycle and early pregnancy; however, in pregnant ewes, exosomes stimulate trophectoderm cells to proliferate and secrete IFNT coordinately with regulation of TLR-mediated cell signaling. These results support our hypothesis that free and/or exosomal enJSRV act on the trophectoderm via TLR to induce the secretion of IFNT in a manner similar to that for innate immune responses of macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells to viral pathogens.

Phenotypic modulation of auto-reactive cells by insertion of tolerogenic molecules via MSC-derived exosomes.	Vet Res Forum	2012	Auto-reactive cells-mediated immune responses are responsible for the current tissue damages during autoimmunity. Accordingly, functional modulation of auto-reactive cells has been a pivotal aim in many of recent studies. In the current study, we investigated the possibility for insertion of regulatory molecules onto auto-reactive cells through exosomal nano-shuttles as a novel approach for phenotype modification of auto-reactive cells. The exosomes were isolated from supernatant of mesenchymal stem cells culture. Resultant exosomes co-cultured with lymphocytes were harvested from established EAE mice in the presence of antigenic MOG35-55 peptide. After 24 hr, insertion of exosomal tolerogenic molecules (PD-L1, TGF-β, galectin-1) onto auto-reactive cells were explored through flow cytometry. The potency of exosomal inserted membrane molecules to modulate phenotype of auto-reactive lymphocytes was assessed upon ELISA test for their-derived cytokines IFN-γ and IL-17. Incorporation of exosomal molecules into lymohocytes' membrane was confirmed by flow cytometric analyses for surface levels of mentioned molecules. Additionally, the decreased secretion of IFN-γ and IL-17 were detected in exosome pre-treated lymphocytes upon stimulation with MOG peptide. Mesenchymal stem cells -derived exosomes showed to be efficient organelles for insertion of bioactive tolerogenic molecules onto auto-reactive cells and modulation of their phenotypes.	PMC4313045

Large oncosomes contain distinct protein cargo and represent a separate functional class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles.	Oncotarget	2015	Large oncosomes (LO) are atypically large (1-10 µm diameter) cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), originating from the shedding of membrane blebs and associated with advanced disease. We report that 25% of the proteins, identified by a quantitative proteomics analysis, are differentially represented in large and nano-sized EVs from prostate cancer cells. Proteins enriched in large EVs included enzymes involved in glucose, glutamine and amino acid metabolism, all metabolic processes relevant to cancer. Glutamine metabolism was altered in cancer cells exposed to large EVs, an effect that was not observed upon treatment with exosomes. Large EVs exhibited discrete buoyant densities in iodixanol (OptiPrep(TM)) gradients. Fluorescent microscopy of large EVs revealed an appearance consistent with LO morphology, indicating that these structures can be categorized as LO. Among the proteins enriched in LO, cytokeratin 18 (CK18) was one of the most abundant (within the top 5th percentile) and was used to develop an assay to detect LO in the circulation and tissues of mice and patients with prostate cancer. These observations indicate that LO represent a discrete EV type that may play a distinct role in tumor progression and that may be a source of cancer-specific markers.	PMC4484459

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	In the past decade, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recognized as potent vehicles of intercellular communication, both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This is due to their capacity to transfer proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, thereby influencing various physiological and pathological functions of both recipient and parent cells. While intensive investigation has targeted the role of EVs in different pathological processes, for example, in cancer and autoimmune diseases, the EV-mediated maintenance of homeostasis and the regulation of physiological functions have remained less explored. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the physiological roles of EVs, which has been written by crowd-sourcing, drawing on the unique EV expertise of academia-based scientists, clinicians and industry based in 27 European countries, the United States and Australia. This review is intended to be of relevance to both researchers already working on EV biology and to newcomers who will encounter this universal cell biological system. Therefore, here we address the molecular contents and functions of EVs in various tissues and body fluids from cell systems to organs. We also review the physiological mechanisms of EVs in bacteria, lower eukaryotes and plants to highlight the functional uniformity of this emerging communication system.	PMC4433489

J Extracell Vesicles	2012	Extracellular micro- and nano-scale membrane vesicles produced by different cells are recognised as an essential entity of physiological fluids in a variety of organisms and function as mediators of intercellular communication employed for the regulation of multiple systemic and local processes. In the last decade, an exponential amount of experimental work was dedicated to exploring the biogenesis and secretion mechanisms, physiological and pathological functions and potential applications of the extracellular vesicles (EVs). Noteworthy is the large heterogeneity of in vitro and in vivo models applied, technical approaches developed in these studies and the diversity of designations assigned to different or similar types of EVs. Hence, there is a clear necessity for a uniform nomenclature and standardisation of methods to isolate and characterise these vesicles. In April 2012, the first meeting of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) took place bringing together this exponentially grown scientific community. The University of Gothenburg (Krefting Research Centre) together with the Interim Board of the Society created in September 2011 (Jan Lötvall, Clotilde Théry, Xandra Breakefield, Marca Wauben, Yong Song Gho, Lawrence Rajendran, Graça Raposo, Douglas Taylor, Margareta Sjöstrand and Esbjörn Telemo) organised this fantastic event that counted 488 registered and contributing participants.

Curcumin Modulates Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Cell-Derived Exosomal Function.	PLoS One	2015	Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rates of all cancer types. One potential explanation for the aggressiveness of this disease is that cancer cells have been found to communicate with one another using membrane-bound vesicles known as exosomes. These exosomes carry pro-survival molecules and increase the proliferation, survival, and metastatic potential of recipient cells, suggesting that tumor-derived exosomes are powerful drivers of tumor progression. Thus, to successfully address and eradicate pancreatic cancer, it is imperative to develop therapeutic strategies that neutralize cancer cells and exosomes simultaneously. Curcumin, a turmeric root derivative, has been shown to have potent anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Recent studies have suggested that exosomal curcumin exerts anti-inflammatory properties on recipient cells. However, curcumin's effects on exosomal pro-tumor function have yet to be determined. We hypothesize that curcumin will alter the pro-survival role of exosomes from pancreatic cancer cells toward a pro-death role, resulting in reduced cell viability of recipient pancreatic cancer cells. The main objective of this study was to determine the functional alterations of exosomes released by pancreatic cancer cells exposed to curcumin compared to exosomes from untreated pancreatic cancer cells. We demonstrate, using an in vitro cell culture model involving pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2, that curcumin is incorporated into exosomes isolated from curcumin-treated pancreatic cancer cells as observed by spectral studies and fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, curcumin is delivered to recipient pancreatic cancer cells via exosomes, promoting cytotoxicity as demonstrated by Hoffman modulation contrast microscopy as well as AlamarBlue and Trypan blue exclusion assays. Collectively, these data suggest that the efficacy of curcumin may be enhanced in pancreatic cancer cells through exosomal facilitation.	PMC4503627

MicroRNA-143 Activation Regulates Smooth Muscle and Endothelial Cell Crosstalk in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.	Circ Res	2015	RATIONALE: The pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains unclear. The 4 microRNAs representing the miR-143 and miR-145 stem loops are genomically clustered. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of the miR-143/145 cluster and the role of miR-143 in PAH. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified the promoter region that regulates miR-143/145 microRNA expression in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). We mapped PAH-related signaling pathways, including estrogen receptor, liver X factor/retinoic X receptor, transforming growth factor-β (Smads), and hypoxia (hypoxia response element), that regulated levels of all pri-miR stem loop transcription and resulting microRNA expression. We observed that miR-143-3p is selectively upregulated compared with miR-143-5p during PASMC migration. Modulation of miR-143 in PASMCs significantly altered cell migration and apoptosis. In addition, we found high abundance of miR-143-3p in PASMC-derived exosomes. Using assays with pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, we demonstrated a paracrine promigratory and proangiogenic effect of miR-143-3p-enriched exosomes from PASMC. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization showed elevated expression of miR-143 in calf models of PAH and in samples from PAH patients. Moreover, in contrast to our previous findings that had not supported a therapeutic role in vivo, we now demonstrate a protective role of miR-143 in experimental pulmonary hypertension in vivo in miR-143-/- and anti-miR-143-3p-treated mice exposed to chronic hypoxia in both preventative and reversal settings. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-143-3p modulated both cellular and exosome-mediated responses in pulmonary vascular cells, whereas inhibition of miR-143-3p blocked experimental pulmonary hypertension. Taken together, these findings confirm an important role for the miR-143/145 cluster in PAH pathobiology.	PMC4620852

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	BACKGROUND: Penetration of skin, migration through tissues and establishment of long-lived intravascular partners require Schistosoma parasites to successfully manipulate definitive host defences. While previous studies of larval schistosomula have postulated a function for excreted/secreted (E/S) products in initiating these host-modulatory events, the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has yet to be considered. Here, using preparatory ultracentrifugation as well as methodologies to globally analyse both proteins and small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), we conducted the first characterization of Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula EVs and their potential host-regulatory cargos. RESULTS: Transmission electron microscopy analysis of EVs isolated from schistosomula in vitro cultures revealed the presence of numerous, 30-100 nm sized exosome-like vesicles. Proteomic analysis of these vesicles revealed a core set of 109 proteins, including homologs to those previously found enriched in other eukaryotic EVs, as well as hypothetical proteins of high abundance and currently unknown function. Characterization of E/S sncRNAs found within and outside of schistosomula EVs additionally identified the presence of potential gene-regulatory miRNAs (35 known and 170 potentially novel miRNAs) and tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs; nineteen 5' tsRNAs and fourteen 3' tsRNAs). CONCLUSIONS: The identification of S. mansoni EVs and the combinatorial protein/sncRNA characterization of their cargo signifies that an important new participant in the complex biology underpinning schistosome/host interactions has now been discovered. Further work defining the role of these schistosomula EVs and the function/stability of intra- and extra-vesicular sncRNA components presents tremendous opportunities for developing novel schistosomiasis diagnostics or interventions.

Cell Rep	2015	Despite several studies describing the secretion of exosomes by Leishmania in vitro, observation of their formation and release in vivo has remained a major challenge. Herein, we show that Leishmania constitutively secretes exosomes within the lumen of the sand fly midgut through a mechanism homologous to the mammalian pathway. Through egestion experiments, we demonstrate that Leishmania exosomes are part of the sand fly inoculum and are co-egested with the parasite during the insect's bite, possibly influencing the host infectious process. Indeed, co-inoculation of mice footpads with L. major plus midgut-isolated or in-vitro-isolated L. major exosomes resulted in a significant increase in footpad swelling. Notably, co-injections produced exacerbated lesions through overinduction of inflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-17a. Our data indicate that Leishmania exosomes are an integral part of the parasite's infectious life cycle, and we propose to add these vesicles to the repertoire of virulence factors associated with vector-transmitted infections.

FASEB J	2016	Exosomes are secreted nanovesicles that are able to transfer RNA and proteins to target cells. The emerging role of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) exosomes as promoters of aerobic ATP synthesis restoration in damaged cells, prompted us to assess whether they contain an extramitochondrial aerobic respiration capacity. Exosomes were isolated from culture medium of human MSCs from umbilical cord of ≥37-wk-old newborns or between 28- to 30-wk-old newborns (i.e.,term or preterm infants). Characterization of samples was conducted by cytofluorometry. Oxidative phosphorylation capacity was assessed by Western blot analysis, oximetry, and luminometric and fluorometric analyses. MSC exosomes express functional respiratory complexes I, IV, and V, consuming oxygen. ATP synthesis was only detectable in exosomes from term newborns, suggestive of a specific mechanism that is not completed at an early gestational age. Activities are outward facing and comparable to those detected in mitochondria isolated from term MSCs. MSC exosomes display an unsuspected aerobic respiratory ability independent of whole mitochondria. This may be relevant for their ability to rescue cell bioenergetics. The differential oxidative metabolism of pretermvs.term exosomes sheds new light on the preterm newborn's clinical vulnerability. A reduced ability to repair damaged tissue and an increased capability to cope with anoxic environment for preterm infants can be envisaged.-Panfoli, I., Ravera, S., Podestà, M., Cossu, C., Santucci, L., Bartolucci, M., Bruschi, M., Calzia, D., Sabatini, F., Bruschettini, M., Ramenghi, L.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2016	Complex interactions between DNA herpesviruses and host factors determine the establishment of a life-long asymptomatic latent infection. The lymphotropic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seems to avoid recognition by innate sensors despite massive transcription of immunostimulatory small RNAs (EBV-EBERs). Here we demonstrate that in latently infected B cells, EBER1 transcripts interact with the lupus antigen (La) ribonucleoprotein, avoiding cytoplasmic RNA sensors. However, in coculture experiments we observed that latent-infected cells trigger antiviral immunity in dendritic cells (DCs) through selective release and transfer of RNA via exosomes. In ex vivo tonsillar cultures, we observed that EBER1-loaded exosomes are preferentially captured and internalized by human plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) that express the TIM1 phosphatidylserine receptor, a known viral- and exosomal target. Using an EBER-deficient EBV strain, enzymatic removal of 5'ppp, in vitro transcripts, and coculture experiments, we established that 5'pppEBER1 transfer via exosomes drives antiviral immunity in nonpermissive DCs. Lupus erythematosus patients suffer from elevated EBV load and activated antiviral immunity, in particular in skin lesions that are infiltrated with pDCs. We detected high levels of EBER1 RNA in such skin lesions, as well as EBV-microRNAs, but no intact EBV-DNA, linking non-cell-autonomous EBER1 presence with skin inflammation in predisposed individuals. Collectively, our studies indicate that virus-modified exosomes have a physiological role in the host-pathogen stand-off and may promote inflammatory disease.	PMC4747727

J Mol Med (Berl)	2016	Recent studies have indicated a protective role of physiological autophagy in ischemic heart disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of autophagy regulation after ischemia are poorly understood. Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles released from cells that play critical roles in mediating cell-to-cell communication through the transfer of microRNAs. In this study, we observed that miR-30a was highly enriched in exosomes from the serum of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients in vivo and culture medium of cardiomyocytes after hypoxic stimulation in vitro. We also found that hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α regulates miR-30a, which efficiently transferred via exosomes between cardiomyocytes after hypoxia. Inhibition of miR-30a or release of exosomes increased the expression of the core autophagy regulators beclin-1, Atg12, and LC3II/LC3I, which contributed to maintaining the autophagic response in cardiomyocytes after hypoxia. Taken together, the present study showed that exosomes from hypoxic cardiomyocytes regulate autophagy by transferring miR-30a in a paracrine manner, which revealed a new pathway of autophagy regulation that might comprise a promising strategy to treat ischemic heart disease. KEY MESSAGES: miR-30a is highly enriched in exosomes from the serum of AMI patients. Hypoxia induces miR-30a upregulation and enrichment into exosomes. MiR-30a is efficiently transferred via exosomes between hypoxic cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of exosome release contributes to maintaining of autophagy after hypoxia. Inhibition of miR-30a augments autophagy after hypoxia.

Cell Mol Neurobiol	2016	In Huntington's disease (HD) the imperfect expanded CAG repeat in the first exon of the HTT gene leads to the generation of a polyglutamine (polyQ) protein, which has some neuronal toxicity, potentially mollified by formation of aggregates. Accumulated research, reviewed here, implicates both the polyQ protein and the expanded repeat RNA in causing toxicity leading to neurodegeneration in HD. Different theories have emerged as to how the neurodegeneration spreads throughout the brain, with one possibility being the transport of toxic protein and RNA in extracellular vesicles (EVs). Most cell types in the brain release EVs and these have been shown to contain neurodegenerative proteins in the case of prion protein and amyloid-beta peptide. In this study, we used a model culture system with an overexpression of HTT-exon 1 polyQ-GFP constructs in human 293T cells and found that the EVs did incorporate both the polyQ-GFP protein and expanded repeat RNA. Striatal mouse neural cells were able to take up these EVs with a consequent increase in the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and polyQ-GFP RNAs, but with no evidence of uptake of polyQ-GFP protein or any apparent toxicity, at least over a relatively short period of exposure. A differentiated striatal cell line expressing endogenous levels of Hdh mRNA containing the expanded repeat incorporated more of this mRNA into EVs as compared to similar cells expressing this mRNA with a normal repeat length. These findings support the potential of EVs to deliver toxic expanded trinucleotide repeat RNAs from one cell to another, but further work will be needed to evaluate potential EV and cell-type specificity of transfer and effects of long-term exposure. It seems likely that expanded HD-associated repeat RNA may appear in biofluids and may have use as biomarkers of disease state and response to therapy.	PMC5844350

J Biol Chem	2016	The microtubule-associated protein tau has a critical role in Alzheimer disease and related tauopathies. There is accumulating evidence that tau aggregates spread and replicate in a prion-like manner, with the uptake of pathological tau seeds causing misfolding and aggregation of monomeric tau in recipient cells. Here we focused on small extracellular vesicles enriched for exosomes that were isolated from the brains of tau transgenic rTg4510 and control mice. We found that these extracellular vesicles contained tau, although the levels were significantly higher in transgenic mice that have a pronounced tau pathology. Tau in the vesicles was differentially phosphorylated, although to a lower degree than in the brain cells from which they were derived. Several phospho-epitopes (AT8, AT100, and AT180) thought to be critical for tau pathology were undetected in extracellular vesicles. Despite this, when assayed with FRET tau biosensor cells, extracellular vesicles derived from transgenic mice were capable of seeding tau aggregation in a threshold-dependent manner. We also observed that the dye used to label extracellular vesicle membranes was still present during nucleation and formation of tau inclusions, suggesting either a role for membranes in the seeding or in the process of degradation. Together, we clearly demonstrate that extracellular vesicles can transmit tau pathology. This indicates a role for extracellular vesicles in the transmission and spreading of tau pathology. The characteristics of tau in extracellular vesicles and the seeding threshold we identified may explain why tau pathology develops very slowly in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease.

Potential role of exosome-associated microRNA panels and in vivo environment to predict drug resistance for patients with multiple myeloma.	Oncotarget	2016	Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic neoplasms and an appropriate in vivo environment for myeloma cells has potential implications for initiation, progression, and metastasis of MM. Exosomes, entities carrying microRNAs (miRNAs) to target locations, participate in the cross-talk between myeloma cells and nonmalignant components of the in vivo environment. This study disclosed the emerging roles of circulating exosome-associated miRNAs in drug resistance (DR) of MM. To this end, the medical records of consecutively hospitalized MM patients, who received novel agents-based therapies, were analyzed. Then, an optimized procedure was established for exosome isolation and exosomal RNA analysis. The exosome-associated miRNA expression patterns for predicting bortezomib (Bz) resistance of MM were further examined using a microarray. In total, 204 patients were enrolled with DR rates of 36.5%, 73.1% and 81.8% in the bortezomib (Bz), thalidomide and lenalidomide containing groups. The serum total light chain ratio ≥ 100, CRP ≥ 20 mg/L, and the second-line usage increased risks of acquired Bz-resistance. Among 68 cases having genetic tests, a high risk factor for predicting de novo DR was 1q21 amplification, which also correlated with lower levels of cholesterol and LDL-C. Moreover, nano-sized exosomes were isolated with significantly increasing internal RNAs and down-regulation of exosomal miR-16-5p, miR-15a-5p and miR-20a-5p, miR-17-5p was revealed in the patients resistant to Bz. The routine workup of MM hardly suggested a value for DR prediction. The circulating exosomes carrying miRNAs provided a window that permits a better understanding of the in vivo intercellular crosstalk in MM patients.	PMC5058725

J Extracell Vesicles	2016	Diagnostic methods that focus on the extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in saliva have been attracting great attention because of their non-invasiveness. EVs contain biomolecules such as proteins, messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), which originate from cells that release EVs, making them an ideal source for liquid biopsy. Although there have been many reports on density-based fractionation of EVs from blood and urine, the number of reports on EVs from saliva has been limited, most probably because of the difficulties in separating EVs from viscous saliva using density gradient centrifugation. This article establishes a protocol for the isolation of EVs from human saliva using density gradient centrifugation. The fractionated salivary EVs were characterized by atomic force microscopy, western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results indicate that salivary EVs have a smaller diameter (47.8±12.3 nm) and higher density (1.11 g/ml) than EVs isolated from conditioned cell media (74.0±23.5 nm and 1.06 g/ml, respectively). Additionally, to improve the throughput of density-based fractionation of EVs, the original protocol was further modified by using a fixed angle rotor instead of a swinging rotor. It was also confirmed that several miRNAs were expressed strongly in the EV-marker-expressing fractions.	PMC4871899

Exosomes Secreted by Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Repair Critical-Sized Bone Defects through Enhanced Angiogenesis and Osteogenesis in Osteoporotic Rats.	Int J Biol Sci	2016	Bone defects caused by trauma, severe infection, tumor resection and skeletal abnormalities are common osteoporotic conditions and major challenges in orthopedic surgery, and there is still no effective solution to this problem. Consequently, new treatments are needed to develop regeneration procedures without side effects. Exosomes secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs, hiPSC-MSC-Exos) incorporate the advantages of both MSCs and iPSCs with no immunogenicity. However, there are no reports on the application of hiPSC-MSC-Exos to enhance angiogenesis and osteogenesis under osteoporotic conditions. HiPSC-MSC-Exos were isolated and identified before use. The effect of hiPSC-MSC-Exos on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow MSCs derived from ovariectomized (OVX) rats (rBMSCs-OVX) in vitro were investigated. In vivo, hiPSC-MSC-Exos were implanted into critical size bone defects in ovariectomized rats, and bone regeneration and angiogenesis were examined by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), sequential fluorescent labeling analysis, microfil perfusion and histological and immunohistochemical analysis. The results in vitro showed that hiPSC-MSC-Exos enhanced cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and up-regulated mRNA and protein expression of osteoblast-related genes in rBMSCs-OVX. In vivo experiments revealed that hiPSC-MSC-Exos dramatically stimulated bone regeneration and angiogenesis in critical-sized calvarial defects in ovariectomized rats. The effect of hiPSC-MSC-Exos increased with increasing concentration. In this study, we showed that hiPSC-MSC-Exos effectively stimulate the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs-OVX, with the effect increasing with increasing exosome concentration. Further analysis demonstrated that the application of hiPSC-MSC-Exos+β-TCP scaffolds promoted bone regeneration in critical-sized calvarial defects by enhancing angiogenesis and osteogenesis in an ovariectomized rat model.

Matrix-bound nanovesicles within ECM bioscaffolds.	Sci Adv	2016	Biologic scaffold materials composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) have been used in a variety of surgical and tissue engineering/regenerative medicine applications and are associated with favorable constructive remodeling properties including angiogenesis, stem cell recruitment, and modulation of macrophage phenotype toward an anti-inflammatory effector cell type. However, the mechanisms by which these events are mediated are largely unknown. Matrix-bound nanovesicles (MBVs) are identified as an integral and functional component of ECM bioscaffolds. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are potent vehicles of intercellular communication due to their ability to transfer RNA, proteins, enzymes, and lipids, thereby affecting physiologic and pathologic processes. Formerly identified exclusively in biologic fluids, the presence of EVs within the ECM of connective tissue has not been reported. In both laboratory-produced and commercially available biologic scaffolds, MBVs can be separated from the matrix only after enzymatic digestion of the ECM scaffold material, a temporal sequence similar to the functional activity attributed to implanted bioscaffolds during and following their degradation when used in clinical applications. The present study shows that MBVs contain microRNA capable of exerting phenotypical and functional effects on macrophage activation and neuroblastoma cell differentiation. The identification of MBVs embedded within the ECM of biologic scaffolds provides mechanistic insights not only into the inductive properties of ECM bioscaffolds but also into the regulation of tissue homeostasis.

J Assist Reprod Genet	2016	PURPOSE: Despite advances in the composition of defined embryo culture media, co-culture with somatic cells is still used for bovine in vitro embryo production (IVEP) in many laboratories worldwide. Granulosa cells are most often used for this purpose, although recent work suggests that co-culture with stem cells of adult or embryonic origin or their derived biomaterials may improve mouse, cattle, and pig embryo development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In experiment 1, in vitro produced bovine embryos were co-cultured in the presence of two concentrations of bovine adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal cells (b-ATMSCs; 103 and 104 cells/mL), in b-ATMSC preconditioned medium (SOF-Cond), or SOF alone (control). In experiment 2, co-culture with 104 b-ATMSCs/mL was compared to the traditional granulosa cell co-culture system (Gran). RESULTS: In experiment 1, co-culture with 104 b-ATMSCs/mL improved blastocyst rates in comparison to conditioned and control media (p < 0.05). Despite that it did not show difference with 103 b-ATMSCs/mL (p = 0.051), group 104 b-ATMSCs/mL yielded higher results of blastocyst production. In experiment 2, when compared to group Gran, co-culture with 104 b-ATMSCs/mL improved not only blastocyst rates but also quality as assessed by increased total cell numbers and mRNA expression levels for POU5F1 and G6PDH (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Co-culture of bovine embryos with b-ATMSCs was more beneficial than the traditional co-culture system with granulosa cells. We speculate that the microenvironmental modulatory potential of MSCs, by means of soluble substances and exosome secretions, could be responsible for the positive effects observed. Further experiments must be done to evaluate if this beneficial effect in vitro also translates to an increase in offspring following embryo transfer. Moreover, this study provides an interesting platform to study the basic requirements during preimplantation embryo development, which, in turn, may aid the improvement of embryo culture protocols in bovine and other species.

Y-box protein 1 is required to sort microRNAs into exosomes in cells and in a cell-free reaction.	Elife	2016	Exosomes are small vesicles that are secreted from metazoan cells and may convey selected membrane proteins and small RNAs to target cells for the control of cell migration, development and metastasis. To study the mechanisms of RNA packaging into exosomes, we devised a purification scheme based on the membrane marker CD63 to isolate a single exosome species secreted from HEK293T cells. Using immunoisolated CD63-containing exosomes we identified a set of miRNAs that are highly enriched with respect to their cellular levels. To explore the biochemical requirements for exosome biogenesis and RNA packaging, we devised a cell-free reaction that recapitulates the species-selective enclosure of miR-223 in isolated membranes supplemented with cytosol. We found that the RNA-binding protein Y-box protein I (YBX1) binds to and is required for the sorting of miR-223 in the cell-free reaction. Furthermore, YBX1 serves an important role in the secretion of miRNAs in exosomes by HEK293T cells.	PMC5047747

J Transl Med	2016	BACKGROUND: FEAT is an intracellular protein that potently drives tumorigenesis in vivo. It is only weakly expressed in normal human tissues, including the testis. In contrast, FEAT is aberrantly upregulated in most human cancers. The present study was designed to investigate whether FEAT is applicable to tumor immunotherapy and whether FEAT is discernible in the bloodstream as a molecular biomarker of human cancers. METHODS: Two mouse FEAT peptides with predicted affinities for major histocompatibility complex H-2Kb and H-2Db were injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice before subcutaneous transplantation of isogenic B16-F10 melanoma cells. Intracellular localization of FEAT was determined by immunogold electron microscopy. Immunoprecipitation was performed to determine whether FEAT was present in blood from cancer patients. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure FEAT concentrations in plasma from 30 cancer patients and eight healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The vaccination experiments demonstrated that FEAT was immunogenic, and that immune responses against FEAT were induced without deleterious side effects in mice. Electron microscopy revealed localization of FEAT in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus. Immunoprecipitation identified FEAT in the blood plasma from cancer patients, while FEAT was not detected in plasma exosomes. Plasma FEAT levels were significantly higher in the presence of cancers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that FEAT is a candidate for applications in early diagnosis and prevention of some cancers.	PMC5034574

Biomaterials	2016	Achieving and maintaining safe and reliable lineage specific differentiation of stem cells is important for clinical translation of tissue engineering strategies. In an effort to circumvent the multitude of problems arising from the usage of growth factors and growth factor delivery systems, we have explored the use of exosomes as biomimetic tools to induce stem cell differentiation. Working on the hypothesis that cell-type specific exosomes can trigger lineage-specific differentiation of stem cells, we have evaluated the potential of exosomes derived from dental pulp cells cultured on under growth and odontogenic differentiation conditions to induce odontogenic differentiation of naïve human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and human bone marrow derived stromal cells (HMSCs) in vitro and in vivo. Results indicate that the exosomes can bind to matrix proteins such as type I collagen and fibronectin enabling them to be tethered to biomaterials. The exosomes are endocytosed by both DPSCs and HMSCs in a dose-dependent and saturable manner via the caveolar endocytic mechanism and trigger the P38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In addition, the exosomes also trigger the increased expression of genes required for odontogenic differentiation. When tested in vivo in a tooth root slice model with DPSCs, the exosomes triggered regeneration of dental pulp-like tissue. However, our results indicate that exosomes isolated under odontogenic conditions are better inducers of stem cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. Overall, our results highlight the potential exosomes as biomimetic tools to induce lineage specific differentiation of stem cells. Our results also show the importance of considering the source and state of exosome donor cells before a choice is made for therapeutic applications.	PMC5293278

In recent years a novel diagnostic biomedical tool with high potential has been identified in extracellular nanovesicles or exosomes. They are released by the majority of the cells and contain detailed molecular information on the cell of origin including tumor hallmarks. Exosomes can be isolated from easy accessible body fluids, and most importantly, they can at once provide with several biomarkers, with different levels of specificity. Recent clinical evidence shows that the levels of exosomes released into body fluids may by themselves represent a predictive/diagnostic of tumors, discriminating cancer patients from healthy subjects. The aim of this review is to highlight these latest challenging findings to provide novel and groundbreaking ideas for successful tumor early diagnosis and follow-up.

NPJ Aging Mech Dis	2016	Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder in which aggregation-prone neurotoxic amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) accumulates in the brain. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small 50-150 nanometer membrane vesicles that have recently been implicated in the prion-like spread of self-aggregating proteins. Here we report that EVs isolated from AD patient CSF and plasma, from the plasma of two AD mouse models, and from the medium of neural cells expressing familial AD presenilin 1 mutations, destabilize neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis, impair mitochondrial function, and sensitize neurons to excitotoxicity. EVs contain a relatively low amount of Aβ but have an increased Aβ42/ Aβ40 ratio; the majority of Aβ is located on the surface of the EVs. Impairment of lysosome function results in increased generation EVs with elevated Aβ42 levels. EVs may mediate transcellular spread of pathogenic Aβ species and that impair neuronal Ca2+ handling and mitochondrial function, and may thereby render neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity.

Increasing circulating exosomes-carrying TRPC5 predicts chemoresistance in metastatic breast cancer patients.	Cancer Sci	2017	Chemoresistance, the major obstacle in breast cancer chemotherapy, results in unnecessary chemotherapy and wasting of medical resources. No feasible method has been available to predict chemoresistance before chemotherapy. In our previous study, elevated expression of transient receptor potential channel TRPC5 was found to be an essential element for chemoresistance in breast cancer cells, and it was determined that it could be transferred to chemosensitive breast cancer cells through releasing extracellular vesicles (EV) containing TRPC5 from chemoresistant cells, resulting in acquired chemoresistance. Exosomes, a type of EV, are secreted membrane-enclosed vesicles of 50-150-nm diameter. In this study we found that circulating exosomes in peripheral blood from breast cancer patients carried TRPC5. In the present study, circulating exosome-carrying TRPC5 (cirExo-TRPC5) level was significantly correlated with TRPC5 expression level in breast cancer tissues and tumor response to chemotherapy. Furthermore, increased cirExo-TRPC5 level after chemotherapy preceded progressive disease (PD) based on imaging examination and strongly predicted acquired chemoresistance. Taken together, our study demonstrated that cirExo-TRPC5 might act as a noninvasive chemoresistance marker and might serve as an adjuvant to the current imaging examination-based chemoresistance.

J Leukoc Biol	2017	Eosinophils are able to secrete exosomes that have an undefined role in asthma pathogenesis. We hypothesized that exosomes released by eosinophils autoregulate and promote eosinophil function. Eosinophils of patients with asthma (n = 58) and healthy volunteers (n = 16) were purified from peripheral blood, and exosomes were isolated and quantified from eosinophils of the asthmatic and healthy populations. Apoptosis, adhesion, adhesion molecules expression, and migration assays were performed with eosinophils in the presence or absence of exosomes from healthy and asthmatic individuals. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by flow cytometry with an intracellular fluorescent probe and nitric oxide (NO) and a colorimetric kit. In addition, exosomal proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Eosinophil-derived exosomes induced an increase in NO and ROS production on eosinophils. Moreover, exosomes could act as a chemotactic factor on eosinophils, and they produced an increase in cell adhesion, giving rise to a specific augmentation of adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 and integrin α2. Protein content between exosomes from healthy and asthmatic individuals seems to be similar in both groups. In conclusion, we found that exosomes from the eosinophils of patients with asthma could modify several specific eosinophil functions related to asthma pathogenesis and that they could contribute fundamentally to the development and maintenance of asthma.

Effects of exosome-like vesicles on cumulus expansion in pigs in vitro.	J Reprod Dev	2017	Cell-secreted vesicles, such as exosomes, have recently been recognized as mediators of cell communication. A recent study in cattle showed the involvement of exosome-like vesicles in the control of cumulus expansion, a prerequisite process for normal ovulation; however, whether this is the case in other mammalian species is not known. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the presence of exosome-like vesicles in ovarian follicles and their effects on cumulus expansion in vitro in pigs. The presence of exosome-like vesicles in porcine follicular fluid (pFF) was confirmed by transmission electron microscopic observation, the detection of marker proteins, and RNA profiles specific to exosomes. Fluorescently labeled exosome-like vesicles isolated from pFF were incorporated into both cumulus and mural granulosa cells in vitro. Exosome-like vesicles were not capable of inducing cumulus expansion to a degree comparable to that induced by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Moreover, exosome-like vesicles had no significant effects on the expression levels of transcripts required for the normal expansion process (HAS2, TNFAIP6, and PTGS2). Interestingly, FSH-induced expression of HAS2 and TNFAIP6 mRNA, but not of PTGS2 mRNA, was significantly increased by the presence of exosome-like vesicles; however, the degree of FSH-induced expansion was not affected. In addition, porcine exosome-like vesicles had no significant effects on the expansion of mouse cumulus-oocyte complexes. Collectively, the present results suggest that exosome-like vesicles are present in pFF, but they are not efficient in inducing cumulus expansion in pigs.	PMC5320430

Urinary Exosomal miR-193a Can Be a Potential Biomarker for the Diagnosis of Primary Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis in Children.	Biomed Res Int	2017	Background. Glomerular upregulation of miR-193a has been detected in primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) but not in other glomerular diseases. We aimed to isolate exosomes from urine of children with primary FSGS and to assess the diagnostic potential of urinary exosomal miR-193a for primary FSGS. Methods. The first morning urine samples were collected from children with primary FSGS (n = 8) and minimal change disease (MCD, n = 5). Isolated urinary exosomes were confirmed by electron microscopy and Western blotting. Urinary exosomal microRNA was extracted, and the expression levels of exosomal miR-193a were quantified by real-time PCR. The diagnosis value of urinary exosomal miR-193a levels for primary FSGS was evaluated by ROC analysis. Results. The isolated vesicles were qualitatively compatible with exosomes. The levels of urinary exosomal miR-193a were significantly higher in children with primary FSGS than those in children with MCD. Moreover, the area under the ROC for the diagnosis of primary FSGS using urinary exosomal miR-193a was 0.85. Conclusions. A significant increase in the levels of urinary exosomal miR-193a in primary FSGS patients compared to those in MCD ones was observed. This study suggests that urinary exosomal miR-193a may be a new noninvasive biomarker for the diagnosis of primary FSGS.	PMC5303601

Relative protein levels of Ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1), P-glycoprotein (P-gp), extracellular-signal regulated protein kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), and phospho-extracellular-signal regulated protein kinase1/2 (p-ERK1/2) were measured by Western blot. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 93 breast cancer samples to assess the associations of UCH-L1 levels with immunofluorescence value of UCH-L1 in circulating exosomes. RESULT: The Adriamycin-resistant human breast cancer cells (MCF7/ADM) secreted exosomes carrying UCH-L1 and P-gp proteins into the extracellular microenvironment then integrated into Adriamycin-sensitive human breast cancer cells (MCF7/WT) in a time-dependent manner, transferring the chemoresistance phenotype. Notably, in blood samples from patients with breast cancer, the level of exosomes carrying UCH-L1 before chemotherapy was significantly negatively correlated with prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that UCH-L1-containing exosomes can transfer chemoresistance to recipient cells and these exosomes may be useful as non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for detection of chemoresitance in breast cancer patients, achieving more effective and individualized chemotherapy.

Stem Cell Res Ther	2017	BACKGROUND: The administration of cisplatin is limited due to its nephrotoxic side effects, and prevention of this nephrotoxicity of cisplatin is difficult. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes have been implicated as a novel therapeutic approach for tissue injury. In this study, we demonstrated that the pretreatment of human umbilical cord MSC-derived exosomes (hucMSC-Ex) can prevent the development of cisplatin-induced renal toxicity by activation of autophagy in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: In vitro, rat renal tubular epithelial (NRK-52E) cells were pre-incubated with exosomes from hucMSC or HFL1 (human lung fibroblast cells; as control) for 30 min, and 3-methyladenine (an autophagic inhibitor) and rapamycin (an autophagic inducer) for 1 h before cisplatin treatment for 8 h, respectively. Cells were harvested for apoptosis assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In vivo, we constructed cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury rat models. Prior to treatment with cisplatin for 0.5 h, hucMSC-Ex or HFL1-Ex were injected into the kidneys via the renal capsule. 3-methyladenine and rapamycin were injected under the kidney capsule before hucMSC-Ex. All animals were sacrificed at 3 days after cisplatin injection. Renal function, Luminex assay, tubular apoptosis and proliferation, and autophagy response were evaluated. RESULTS: hucMSC-Ex inhibited cisplatin-induced mitochondrial apoptosis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines in renal tubular epithelial cells in vitro. hucMSC-Ex increased the expression of the autophagic marker protein LC3B and the autophagy-related genes ATG5 and ATG7 in NRK-52E cells. Rapamycin mimicked the effects of hucMSC-Ex in protecting against cisplatin-induced renal injury, while the effects were abrogated by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine in the animals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the activation of autophagy induced by hucMSC-Ex can effectively relieve the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin. Therefore, pre-treatment of hucMSC-Ex may be a new method to improve the therapeutic effect of cisplatin.	PMC5385032

Exosomes derived from mesenchymal non-small cell lung cancer cells promote chemoresistance.	Int J Cancer	2017	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer type and the most common cause of mortality in lung cancer patients. NSCLC is often associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics and together with rapid metastatic spread, results in limited treatment options and poor patient survival. NSCLCs are heterogeneous, and consist of epithelial and mesenchymal NSCLC cells. Mesenchymal NSCLC cells are thought to be responsible for the chemoresistance phenotype, but if and how this phenotype can be transferred to other NSCLC cells is currently not known. We hypothesised that small extracellular vesicles, exosomes, secreted by mesenchymal NSCLC cells could potentially transfer the chemoresistance phenotype to surrounding epithelial NSCLC cells. To explore this possibility, we used a unique human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) model in which the parental cells were transformed from an epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype by introducing oncogenic alterations common in NSCLC. We found that exosomes derived from the oncogenically transformed, mesenchymal HBECs could transfer chemoresistance to the parental, epithelial HBECs and increase ZEB1 mRNA, a master EMT transcription factor, in the recipient cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that exosomes from mesenchymal, but not epithelial HBECs contain the ZEB1 mRNA, thereby providing a potential mechanism for the induction of a mesenchymal phenotype in recipient cells. Together, this work demonstrates for the first time that exosomes derived from mesenchymal, oncogenically transformed lung cells can transfer chemoresistance and mesenchymal phenotypes to recipient cells, likely via the transfer of ZEB1 mRNA in exosomes.

Exosomes promote restoration after an experimental animal model of intracerebral hemorrhage.	J Cereb Blood Flow Metab	2018	Exosomes are gaining importance because they show great promise in therapeutic applications for several diseases. Particularly in stroke, exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy work as paracrine effectors responsible for promoting neurovascular remodeling and functional recovery. Adult male rats were subjected to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) by intrastriatal injection of collagenase type IV; 24 h after surgery, MSC-derived exosomes were administered through the tail vein. The rats were euthanized at 7 or 28 days after treatment. Functional evaluation, lesion size, fiber tract integrity, axonal sprouting and white matter repair markers, biodistribution of exosomes and secretome proteomics were analyzed. DiI-labeled exosomes were found in the brains of the ICH-treated group and in the liver, lung and spleen. Animals receiving treatment with exosomes showed significantly better results in terms of functional recovery, lesion size, fiber tract integrity, axonal sprouting and white matter repair markers compared with the control group 28 days after stroke. Proteomics analysis of the exosomes identified more than 2000 proteins that could be implicated in brain repair function. In conclusion, white matter integrity was partly restored by exosome administration mediated by molecular repair factors. Exosomes as a treatment could be a heterogeneous process by nature and presents many factors that can influence brain plasticity in an adaptable and versatile manner.

Clin Cancer Res	2017	Purpose: To identify tumor-derived exosomal biomarkers that are able to discriminate between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) as a noninvasive method in the early diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Experimental Design: Tumor-derived exosomes from the plasma of early-stage NSCLC patients were isolated. Exosomal miRNA profiling of 46 stage I NSCLC patients and 42 healthy individuals was performed using miRNA-seq to identify and validate adenocarcinoma- and SCC-specific miRNAs. The diagnostic accuracy of select miRNAs was tested further with an additional 60 individuals.Results: There were 11 and 6 miRNAs expressed at remarkably higher levels, 13 and 8 miRNAs expressed at lower levels in adenocarcinoma and SCC patients, respectively, compared with healthy volunteers. Distinct adenocarcinoma- and SCC-specific exosomal miRNAs were validated. The reliability of miRNA-seq data was verified with several demonstrated diagnostic potential miRNAs for NSCLC and other carcinomas, as reported in previous studies, such as let-7, miR-21, miR-24, and miR-486. The results indicated that miR-181-5p, miR-30a-3p, miR-30e-3p, and miR-361-5p were adenocarcinoma-specific, and miR-10b-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-320b were SCC-specific. The diagnostic accuracy of three combination miRNA panels was evaluated using an AUC value of 0.899, 0.936, and 0.911 for detecting NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, and SCC, respectively.Conclusions: Tumor-derived exosomal miRNAs, adenocarcinoma-specific miR-181-5p, miR-30a-3p, miR-30e-3p and miR-361-5p, and SCC-specific miR-10b-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-320b were observed by next-generation sequencing, and their diagnostic accuracy were verified. These miRNAs may be promising and effective candidates in the development of highly sensitive, noninvasive biomarkers for early NSCLC diagnosis. Clin Cancer Res; 23(17); 5311-9. ©2017 AACR.

Fibroblast-derived exosomes promote epithelial cell proliferation through TGF-β2 signalling pathway in severe asthma.	Allergy	2018	BACKGROUND: Bronchial fibroblasts play a key role in airway remodelling in asthma. They regulate epithelial cell functions such as proliferation through growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and exosomes. The role of exosomes in the communication between epithelial cells and fibroblasts by vehiculing these mediators in asthma remains to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of exosomes released by bronchial fibroblasts on epithelial cell proliferation in severe asthma. METHODS: Exosomes were obtained from culture media of primary bronchial fibroblasts and characterized using Western blot, electron microscopy and flow cytometry. Uptake profile of fluorescent-labelled exosomes in epithelial cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Exosome cytokine content was analysed by Cytokine Arrays. Bronchial epithelial cell proliferation was evaluated by BrdU incorporation test. Exosome biogenesis/release was blocked using sphingomyelinase inhibitor. Plasmid transfection was used to modulate transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-β2) gene expression. RESULTS: We showed that bronchial fibroblasts secreted exosomes, which were internalized by bronchial epithelial cells. Exosomes of severe asthmatic subjects' fibroblasts showed a lower level of TGF-β2 and significantly increased the epithelial cell proliferation of both healthy and severe asthmatic subjects compared to healthy controls' exosomes. Overexpression of TGF-β2 in severe asthmatics' fibroblasts induced enhanced TGF-β2 in exosomes leading to a reduced proliferation of epithelial cells, whereas knockdown of TGF-β2 enhanced epithelial cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that exosomes are involved in fine-tuning intercellular communication in asthma. Exosomes of severe eosinophilic asthmatics' fibroblasts can contribute to airway remodelling, at least in part, by modulating epithelial cell proliferation observed in severe asthma.

Electronic address: .	andyminn@upenn.edu		Exosome RNA Unshielding Couples Stromal Activation to Pattern Recognition Receptor Signaling in Cancer.	Cell	2017	Interactions between stromal fibroblasts and cancer cells generate signals for cancer progression, therapy resistance, and inflammatory responses. Although endogenous RNAs acting as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) for pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) may represent one such signal, these RNAs must remain unrecognized under non-pathological conditions. We show that triggering of stromal NOTCH-MYC by breast cancer cells results in a POL3-driven increase in RN7SL1, an endogenous RNA normally shielded by RNA binding proteins SRP9/14. This increase in RN7SL1 alters its stoichiometry with SRP9/14 and generates unshielded RN7SL1 in stromal exosomes. After exosome transfer to immune cells, unshielded RN7SL1 drives an inflammatory response. Upon transfer to breast cancer cells, unshielded RN7SL1 activates the PRR RIG-I to enhance tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Corroborated by evidence from patient tumors and blood, these results demonstrate that regulation of RNA unshielding couples stromal activation with deployment of RNA DAMPs that promote aggressive features of cancer.

HCV-E2 inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis by stimulating mast cells to secrete exosomal shuttle microRNAs.	Oncol Lett	2017	Exosomal miRNAs are emerging as mediators of the interaction between mast cells (MCs) and tumor cells. The exosomal miRNAs can be internalized by liver cancer cells to inhibit cell metastasis. We explored the interaction between MCs and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. We used hepatitis C virus E2 envelope glycoprotein (HCV-E2) to stimulate MCs and harvest MCs-derived exosomes to detect the miRNAs and changes of exosomal miRNAs before and after stimulation. Through miRNA microarray analysis, we identified 19 differentially expressed miRNAs in exosomes derived from MCs with or without HCV-E2 treatment. HCV-E2 not only increased the level of miRNA-490 in MCs and their secreted exosomes but also increased the levels of miRNA-490 in recipient HepG2 cells, which ultimately inhibited the ERK1/2 pathway. The transfection of antagomiR-490 significantly decreased the levels of miR-490 in MCs, MCs-derived exosomes, and recipient HepG2 cells and increased migration of HepG2, indicating that miR-490 is involved in the regulation of HepG2 cell migration. The present study suggests that MCs can inhibit HCC cell metastasis by inhibiting the ERK1/2 pathway by transferring the exosomal shuttle microRNAs into HCC cells, which provides new insights for the biological therapy of HCC induced by hepatitis C.

Eur Biophys J	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small vesicles ensuring transport of molecules between cells and throughout the body. EVs contain cell type-specific signatures and have been proposed as biomarkers in a variety of diseases. Their small size (<1 μm) and biological and physical functions make them obvious candidates for therapeutic agents in immune therapy, vaccination, regenerative medicine and drug delivery. However, due to the complexity and heterogeneity of their origin and composition, the actual mechanism through which these vesicles exert their functions is still unknown and represents a great biomedical challenge. Moreover, because of their small dimensions, the quantification, size distribution and biophysical characterization of these particles are challenging and still subject to controversy. Here, we address the advantage of atomic force microscopy (AFM), for the characterization of isolated EVs. We review AFM imaging of EVs immobilized on different substrates (mica, glass) to identify the influence of isolation and deposition methods on the size distribution, morphology and mechanical properties of EVs.

Ezetimibe ameliorates steatohepatitis via AMP activated protein kinase-TFEB-mediated activation of autophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition.	Autophagy	2017	Impairment in macroautophagy/autophagy flux and inflammasome activation are common characteristics of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Considering the lack of approved agents for treating NASH, drugs that can enhance autophagy and modulate inflammasome pathways may be beneficial. Here, we investigated the novel mechanism of ezetimibe, a widely prescribed drug for hypercholesterolemia, as a therapeutic option for ameliorating NASH. Human liver samples with steatosis and NASH were analyzed. For in vitro studies of autophagy and inflammasomes, primary mouse hepatocytes, human hepatoma cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts with Ampk or Tsc2 knockout, and human or primary mouse macrophages were treated with ezetimibe and palmitate. Steatohepatitis and fibrosis were induced by feeding Atg7 wild-type, haploinsufficient, and knockout mice a methionine- and choline-deficient diet with ezetimibe (10 mg/kg) for 4 wk. Human livers with steatosis or NASH presented impaired autophagy with decreased nuclear TFEB and increased SQSTM1, MAP1LC3-II, and NLRP3 expression. Ezetimibe increased autophagy flux and concomitantly ameliorated lipid accumulation and apoptosis in palmitate-exposed hepatocytes. Ezetimibe induced AMPK phosphorylation and subsequent TFEB nuclear translocation, related to MAPK/ERK. In macrophages, ezetimibe blocked the NLRP3 inflammasome-IL1B pathway in an autophagy-dependent manner and modulated hepatocyte-macrophage interaction via extracellular vesicles. Ezetimibe attenuated lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis in liver-specific Atg7 wild-type and haploinsufficient mice, but not in knockout mice. Ezetimibe ameliorates steatohepatitis by autophagy induction through AMPK activation and TFEB nuclear translocation, related to an independent MTOR ameliorative effect and the MAPK/ERK pathway. Ezetimibe dampens NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages by modulating autophagy and a hepatocyte-driven exosome pathway.	PMC5640190

Mesenchymal stem cells as natural biofactories for exosomes carrying miR-124a in the treatment of gliomas.	Neuro Oncol	2018	Background: MicroRNAs (miRs) are promising new therapeutics for glioblastoma. However, which miRs are most effective against glioblastomas and how these miRs should be delivered are major unanswered problems. Methods: To identify potent antiglioma miRs, we selected 8 miRs based on a literature search and screened them against a panel of glioma stem cell (GSC) lines, representing all of the glioblastoma subtypes defined by The Cancer Genome Atlas. To address delivery, we tested the hypothesis that ex vivo cultured bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can package miRs into exosomes and that these engineered exosomes can systemically deliver antiglioma miRs to glioblastomas. Results: Of the screened miRs, we identified miR-124a as the most effective antiglioma agent against GSCs. We then transduced MSCs with lentivirus vectors containing miR-124a and isolated vesicles from the medium. Electron microscopy, western blotting, and Nanosight proved that the isolated vesicles were exosomes. Quantitative PCR documented that these exosomes contained high levels of miR-124a, which was not present in control exosomes. In vitro treatment of GSCs with exosomes containing miR-124a (Exo-miR124) resulted in a significant reduction in viability and clonogenicity of GSCs compared with controls. In vivo treatment of mice harboring intracranial GSC267 with systemically delivered Exo-miR124 resulted in 50% of animals living long term. No evidence of tumor was present on histological analysis of the survivors. Mechanistic studies showed that miR-124a acts by silencing Forkhead box (FOX)A2, resulting in aberrant intracellular lipid accumulation. Conclusion: MSCs can be used as natural biofactories to produce Exo-miR124, which is an effective antiglioma agent worthy of further clinical evaluation.	PMC5817945

Enhancement of the Intrinsic Peroxidase-Like Activity of Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets by ssDNAs and Its Application for Detection of Exosomes.	Anal Chem	2017	The present work investigates the capability of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in enhancing the intrinsic peroxidase-like activity of the g-C3N4 nanosheets (NSs). We found that ssDNA adsorbed on g-C3N4 NSs could improve the catalytic activity of the nanosheets. The maximum reaction rate of the H2O2-mediated TMB oxidation catalyzed by the ssDNA-NSs hybrid was at least 4 times faster than that obtained with unmodified NSs. The activity enhancement could be attributed to the strong interaction between TMB and ssDNA mediated by electrostatic attraction and aromatic stacking and by both the length and base composition of the ssDNA. The high catalytic activity of the ssDNA-NSs hybrid permitted sensitive colorimetric detection of exosomes if the aptamer against CD63, a surface marker of exosome, was employed in hybrid construction. The sensor recognized the differential expression of CD63 between the exosomes produced by a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and a control cell line (MCF-10A). Moreover, a similar trend was detected in the circulating exosomes isolated from the sera samples collected from breast cancer patients and healthy controls. Our work sheds lights on the possibility of using ssDNA to enhance the peroxidase-like activity of nanomaterials and demonstrates the high potential of the ssDNA-NSs hybrid in clinical diagnosis using liquid biopsy.

Diabetes	2018	Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) play critical roles in controlling obesity-associated inflammation and metabolic disorders. Exosomes from ADSCs exert protective effects in several diseases, but their roles in obesity and related pathological conditions remain unclear. In this study, we showed that treatment of obese mice with ADSC-derived exosomes facilitated their metabolic homeostasis, including improved insulin sensitivity (27.8% improvement), reduced obesity, and alleviated hepatic steatosis. ADSC-derived exosomes drove alternatively activated M2 macrophage polarization, inflammation reduction, and beiging in white adipose tissue (WAT) of diet-induced obese mice. Mechanistically, exosomes from ADSCs transferred into macrophages to induce anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes through the transactivation of arginase-1 by exosome-carried active STAT3. Moreover, M2 macrophages induced by ADSC-derived exosomes not only expressed high levels of tyrosine hydroxylase responsible for catecholamine release, but also promoted ADSC proliferation and lactate production, thereby favoring WAT beiging and homeostasis in response to high-fat challenge. These findings delineate a novel exosome-mediated mechanism for ADSC-macrophage cross talk that facilitates immune and metabolic homeostasis in WAT, thus providing potential therapy for obesity and diabetes.

J Extracell Vesicles	2017	Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) such as exosomes are nanocarriers of proteins, RNAs and DNAs. Isolation of pure sEV populations remains challenging, with reports of protein and lipoprotein contaminants in the isolates. Cellular uptake - a cornerstone for understanding exosome and sEV function - is frequently examined using lipophilic dyes such as PKH67 or CellMask to label the vesicles. In this study, we investigated whether contaminants can confound the outcomes from sEV and exosomes uptake experiments. sEVs were isolated from blood plasma of fasted or non-fasted rats as well as from serum-supplemented or serum-free conditioned cell culture medium using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Eluent fractions were characterized using nanoparticle tracking, protein and triglyceride assays and immunoassays. SEC fractions were labelled with different lipophilic dyes and cellular uptake was quantified using endothelial cells or primary cardiomyocytes. We report co-isolation of sEVs with apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. Cellular dye transfer did not correspond to sEV content of the SEC fractions, but was severely affected by lipoprotein and protein content. Overnight fasting of rats decreased lipoprotein content and also decreased dye transfer, while late, sEV-poor/protein-rich fractions demonstrated even greater dye transfer. The potential for dye transfer to occur in the complete absence of sEVs was clearly shown by experiments using staining of sEV-depleted serum or pure protein sample. In conclusion, proteins and lipoproteins can make a substantial contribution to transfer of lipophilic dyes to recipient cells. Considering the likelihood of contamination of sEV and exosome isolates, lipophilic dye staining experiments should be carefully controlled, and conclusions interpreted with caution.	PMC5699187

Intercellular Transfer of Microvesicles from Young Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Rejuvenates Aged Murine Hematopoietic Stem Cells.	Stem Cells	2018	Donor age is one of the major concerns in bone marrow transplantation, as the aged hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) fail to engraft efficiently. Here, using murine system, we show that a brief interaction of aged HSCs with young mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) rejuvenates them and restores their functionality via inter-cellular transfer of microvesicles (MVs) containing autophagy-related mRNAs. Importantly, we show that MSCs gain activated AKT signaling as a function of aging. Activated AKT reduces the levels of autophagy-related mRNAs in their MVs, and partitions miR-17 and miR-34a into their exosomes, which upon transfer into HSCs downregulate their autophagy-inducing mRNAs. Our data identify previously unknown mechanisms operative in the niche-mediated aging of HSCs. Inhibition of AKT in aged MSCs increases the levels of autophagy-related mRNAs in their MVs and reduces the levels of miR-17 and miR-34a in their exosomes. Interestingly, transplantation experiments showed that the rejuvenating power of these "rescued" MVs is even better than that of the young MVs. We demonstrate that such ex vivo rejuvenation of aged HSCs could expand donor cohort and improve transplantation efficacy. Stem Cells 2018;36:420-433.

Enhanced liver gene transfer and evasion of preexisting humoral immunity with exosome-enveloped AAV vectors.	Blood Adv	2017	Results from clinical trials of liver gene transfer for hemophilia demonstrate the potential of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector platform. However, to achieve therapeutic transgene expression, in some cases high vector doses are required, which are associated with a higher risk of triggering anti-capsid cytotoxic T-cell responses. Additionally, anti-AAV preexisting immunity can prevent liver transduction even at low neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers. Here, we describe the use of exosome-associated AAV (exo-AAV) vectors as a robust liver gene delivery system that allows the therapeutic vector dose to be decreased while protecting from preexisting humoral immunity to the capsid. The in vivo efficiency of liver targeting of standard AAV8 or AAV5 and exo-AAV8 or exo-AAV5 vectors expressing human coagulation factor IX (hF.IX) was evaluated. A significant enhancement of transduction efficiency was observed, and in hemophilia B mice treated with 4 × 1010 vector genomes per kilogram of exo-AAV8 vectors, a staggering ∼1 log increase in hF.IX transgene expression was observed, leading to superior correction of clotting time. Enhanced liver expression was also associated with an increase in the frequency of regulatory T cells in lymph nodes. The efficiency of exo- and standard AAV8 vectors in evading preexisting NAbs to the capsid was then evaluated in a passive immunization mouse model and in human sera. Exo-AAV8 gene delivery allowed for efficient transduction even in the presence of moderate NAb titers, thus potentially extending the proportion of subjects eligible for liver gene transfer. Exo-AAV vectors therefore represent a platform to improve the safety and efficacy of liver-directed gene transfer.	PMC5728288

J Cell Physiol	2018	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been approved as a cellular drug for the treatment of a variety of immune-related diseases by the government of many countries'. Previous investigations, including ours, have shown that exosomes secreted by MSCs (MSC-ex) are one of the main factors responsible for the therapeutic effect of MSCs. However, the immune modulation activities and the contents of MSC-ex derived from cells under different incubation conditions differ dramatically. Therefore, the optimal way to ensure effectiveness is by identifying and preparing MSC-ex with confirmed potent immunosuppressive activity. The aim of this study was to investigate and analyze the composition and function of MSC-ex secreted by MSCs stimulated by different cytokines to obtain exosomes with more potent immunosuppressive activity. To achieve this aim, umbilical cord-derived MSCs were treated with PBS, TGF-β, IFN-γ, or TGF-β plus IFN-γ for 72 hr. Then, exosomes were isolated from the culture supernatants. Common exosome markers, such as CD9, CD63, and CD81, were detected and analyzed by FCM. At the same time, the TGF-β, IFN-γ, IDO, and IL-10 content in exosomes was detected, and the influence of exosmes from defferent groups on the induction of mononuclear cell transformation into Tregs was analyzed via FCM. Our results show that the TGF-β combined with IFN-γ exosome group more effectively promoted the transformation of mononuclear cells to Tregs, and the analysis showed that IDO may play an important role. This study might provide a novel strategy to treat GVHD as well as other immune-associated disorders.

Increased ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450-2E1 and cytochrome P450 isoforms in exosomes of alcohol-exposed rodents and patients with alcoholism through oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress.	Hepatol Commun	2017	This study investigated the role of ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450-2E1 (CYP2E1) in enhancing CYP2E1 and other P450 proteins in extracellular vesicles (EVs) from alcohol-exposed rodents and human patients with alcoholism and their effects on oxidative hepatocyte injury. Female Fischer rats and wild-type or Cyp2e1-null mice were exposed to three oral doses of binge ethanol or dextrose control at 12-hour intervals. Plasma EV and hepatic proteins from alcohol-exposed rodents, patients with alcoholism, and their respective controls were isolated and characterized. The number of EVs and the amounts of EV CYP2E1, CYP2A, CYP1A1/2, and CYP4B proteins were markedly elevated in both patients with alcoholism and alcohol-exposed rats and mice. The number of EVs and EV P450 proteins were significantly reduced in ethanol-exposed rats fed a diet containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. The increased number of EVs and EV CYP2E1 and other P450 isoforms in alcohol-exposed wild types were significantly reduced in the corresponding Cyp2e1-null mice. EV CYP2E1 amounts depended on increased oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress because their levels were decreased by cotreatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or the CYP2E1 inhibitor chlormethiazole but increased by ER stress-inducer thapsigargin, which was blocked by 4-phenylbutyric acid. Furthermore, cell death rates were elevated when primary hepatocytes or human hepatoma cells were exposed to EVs from alcohol-exposed rodents and patients with alcoholism, demonstrating that EVs from alcohol-exposed rats and patients with alcoholism are functional and can promote cell death by activating the apoptosis signaling pathway, including phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase, proapoptotic Bax, and activated caspase-3. Conclusion: CYP2E1 has an important role in elevating EV CYP2E1 and other P450 isoforms through increased oxidative and ER stress. Elevated EV-CYP2E1 detected after withdrawal from alcohol or exposure to the CYP2E1 inducer pyrazole can be a potential biomarker for liver injury. (Hepatology Communications 2017;1:675-690).

Electronic address: .	hjmok@konkuk.ac.kr		Comparative evaluation of cell- and serum-derived exosomes to deliver immune stimulators to lymph nodes.	Biomaterials	2018	To determine whether exosomes are efficient carriers for immune stimulating molecules into lymph nodes, comparative studies of exosomes (EXOs) derived from different origins (cells and serums) in terms of physicochemical properties and delivery efficiency were performed. Serum-derived EXOs were of a preferable size and generated higher yields than RAW264.7 cell-derived exosomes (RAW-EXO). In particular, fetal bovine serum-derived exosomes (bo-EXO), with a size below 50 nm, were delivered not only to surface zones (subcapsular sinus (SCS) macrophage zone) but also to inner paracortex zones (T cell zone) of lymph nodes, which allowed an efficient delivery of immune stimulating molecules to antigen presenting cells and T cells. The encapsulation of immune stimulating biomolecules (monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN)) within EXOs greatly increased intracellular delivery to macrophages via phagocytic pathways, which induced higher TNF-α and IL-6 secretion than free MPLA and free CpG ODN. MPLA-incorporated exosomes activated and differentiated T cells after subcutaneous injection, which elevated cytokine IFN-γ and TNF-α induction for CD3+ T cells. Taken together, bo-EXOs might serve as efficient carrier systems of immune stimulators to lymph nodes for desired immune responses.	
29492481	Chen Chen	Advanced Photonics Center, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China. .	cyp@seu.edu.cn		Visualization and intracellular dynamic tracking of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs using single molecule localization microscopy.	Nanoscale	2018	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles secreted by a wide variety of cells. Studies have demonstrated that exosomal miRNAs can influence the biological processes of recipient cells. Therefore, direct imaging and tracking of exosomal miRNAs in living recipient cells are essential for exosome functional analysis. However, the moderate spatial resolution of conventional fluorescence microscopy limits the precise imaging and tracking of exosomes considering their relatively small size (<100 nm). Here, we took advantage of single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) to realize the visualization and dynamic tracking of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs in living cells. First, we demonstrated simultaneous SMLM imaging of HeLa-derived exosomes and two kinds of exosomal miRNAs (mir-21 and mir-31) and tracked their movement after cellular uptake. The motion of exosomes within the intercellular filamentous structures was observed successfully. Moreover, dual-color SMLM based dynamic tracking revealed that as one kind of natural carrier of cellular cargoes, exosomes can encapsulate mir-21 inside to prevent enzyme degradation during transfer and then release them into recipient cells. These findings can provide new insights into the pathway of intercellular communication and affirm that SMLM is a powerful technique to track the motion of exosomes and exosomal contents in recipient cells.

Scalable, cGMP-compatible purification of extracellular vesicles carrying bioactive human heterodimeric IL-15/lactadherin complexes.	J Extracell Vesicles	2018	The development of extracellular vesicles (EV) for therapeutic applications is contingent upon the establishment of reproducible, scalable, and high-throughput methods for the production and purification of clinical grade EV. Methods including ultracentrifugation (U/C), ultrafiltration, immunoprecipitation, and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) have been employed to isolate EV, each facing limitations such as efficiency, particle purity, lengthy processing time, and/or sample volume. We developed a cGMP-compatible method for the scalable production, concentration, and isolation of EV through a strategy involving bioreactor culture, tangential flow filtration (TFF), and preparative SEC. We applied this purification method for the isolation of engineered EV carrying multiple complexes of a novel human immunostimulatory cytokine-fusion protein, heterodimeric IL-15 (hetIL-15)/lactadherin. HEK293 cells stably expressing the fusion cytokine were cultured in a hollow-fibre bioreactor. Conditioned medium was collected and EV were isolated comparing three procedures: U/C, SEC, or TFF + SEC. SEC demonstrated comparable particle recovery, size distribution, and hetIL-15 density as U/C purification. Relative to U/C, SEC preparations achieved a 100-fold reduction in ferritin concentration, a major protein-complex contaminant. Comparative proteomics suggested that SEC additionally decreased the abundance of cytoplasmic proteins not associated with EV. Combination of TFF and SEC allowed for bulk processing of large starting volumes, and resulted in bioactive EV, without significant loss in particle yield or changes in size, morphology, and hetIL-15/lactadherin density. Taken together, the combination of bioreactor culture with TFF + SEC comprises a scalable, efficient method for the production of highly purified, bioactive EV carrying hetIL-15/lactadherin, which may be useful in targeted cancer immunotherapy approaches.

Exosomal microRNA profiling to identify hypoxia-related biomarkers in prostate cancer.	Oncotarget	2018	Hypoxia and expression of hypoxia-related biomarkers are associated with disease progression and treatment failure in prostate cancer (PCa). We have reported that exosomes (nanovesicles of 30-150 nm in diameter) secreted by human PCa cells under hypoxia promote invasiveness and stemness in naïve PCa cells. Here, we identified the unique microRNAs (miRNAs) loaded in exosomes secreted by PCa cells under hypoxia. Using TaqMan® array microRNA cards, we analyzed the miRNA profile in exosomes secreted by human PCa LNCaP cells under hypoxic (ExoHypoxic) and normoxic (ExoNormoxic) conditions. We identified 292 miRNAs loaded in both ExoHypoxic and ExoNormoxic. The top 11 miRNAs with significantly higher level in ExoHypoxic compared to ExoNormoxic were miR-517a, miR-204, miR-885, miR-143, miR-335, miR-127, miR-542, miR-433, miR-451, miR-92a and miR-181a; and top nine miRNA with significantly lower expression level in ExoHypoxic compared to ExoNormoxic were miR-521, miR-27a, miR-324, miR-579, miR-502, miR-222, miR-135b, miR-146a and miR-491. Importantly, the two differentially expressed miRNAs miR-885 (increased expression) and miR-521 (decreased expression) showed similar expression pattern in exosomes isolated from the serum of PCa patients compared to healthy individuals. Additionally, miR-204 and miR-222 displayed correlated expression patterns in prostate tumors (Pearson R = 0.66, p < 0.0001) by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) genomic dataset analysis. Overall, the present study identified unique miRNAs with differential expression in exosomes secreted from hypoxic PCa cells and suggests their potential usefulness as a biomarker of hypoxia in PCa patients.

Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol	2018	The microenvironment of native heart tissue may be better replicated when cardiomyocytes are cultured in three-dimensional clusters (i.e., spheroids) than in monolayers or as individual cells. Thus, we differentiated human, cardiac-lineage, induced-pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and allowed them to form spheroids and spheroid fusions, which were characterized in vitro and evaluated in mice after experimentally induced myocardial infarction (MI). Synchronized contractions were observed within 24 hours of spheroid formation, and optical mapping studies confirmed the presence of both calcium transients and propagating action potentials. In spheroid fusions, the intraspheroid conduction velocity (CV) was 7.0{plus minus}3.8 cm/s on day 1-2 after formation, while the CV between spheroids increased significantly (p=0.003) from 0.8{plus minus}1.1 cm/s on day 1-2 to 3.3{plus minus}1.4 cm/s on day 7. For the murine MI model, five-spheroid fusions (200,000 hiPSC-CMs/spheroid) were embedded in a fibrin patch, and the patch was transplanted over the site of infarction. Four weeks later, echocardiographic measurements of left-ventricular ejection fractions and fractional shortening were significantly greater in patch-treated animals than in animals that recovered without the patch, and the engraftment rate was 25.6% or 30% when evaluated histologically or via bioluminescence imaging, respectively. The exosomes released from the spheroid patch seemed to increase cardiac function. In conclusion, our studies established the feasibility of using hiPSC-CM spheroids and spheroid fusions for cardiac-tissue engineering, and when fibrin patches containing hiPSC-CM spheroid fusions were evaluated in a murine MI model, the engraftment rate was much higher than the rates we have achieved via the direct intramyocardial injection.

Proteomic Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Reveals a Paracrine Role for MFAP5 in Human Oral Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma.	J Proteome Res	2018	Bidirectional communication between cells and their microenvironment is crucial for both normal tissue homeostasis and tumor growth. During the development of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) create a supporting niche by maintaining a bidirectional crosstalk with cancer cells, mediated by classically secreted factors and various nanometer-sized vesicles, termed as extracellular vesicles (EVs). To better understand the role of CAFs within the tumor stroma and elucidate the mechanism by which secreted proteins contribute to OTSCC progression, we isolated and characterized patient-derived CAFs from resected tumors with matched adjacent tissue fibroblasts (AFs). Our strategy employed shotgun proteomics to comprehensively characterize the proteomes of these matched fibroblast populations. Our goals were to identify CAF-secreted factors (EVs and soluble) that can functionally modulate OTSCC cells in vitro and to identify novel CAF-associated biomarkers. Comprehensive proteomic analysis identified 4247 proteins, the most detailed description of a pro-tumorigenic stroma to date. We demonstrated functional effects of CAF secretomes (EVs and conditioned media) on OTSCC cell growth and migration. Comparative proteomics identified novel proteins associated with a CAF-like state. Specifically, MFAP5, a protein component of extracellular microfibrils, was enriched in CAF secretomes. Using in vitro assays, we demonstrated that MFAP5 activated OTSCC cell growth and migration via activation of MAPK and AKT pathways. Using a tissue microarray of richly annotated primary human OTSCCs, we demonstrated an association of MFAP5 expression with patient survival. In summary, our proteomics data of patient-derived stromal fibroblasts provide a useful resource for future mechanistic and biomarker studies.

Andrology	2018	Prostasomes are exosomes such as extracellular vesicles, produced in the prostatic epithelium and released into the seminal plasma, that play an important role enhancing male fertility. Although some studies have demonstrated that prostasomes have a rich proteomic content, it is still unclear if that proteomic content varies depending on the male fertility status. Prostasomes from 12 normozoospermic and 14 non-normozoospermic seminal samples were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation. Protein content was studied by quantitative mass spectrometry and compared between both cohorts. We identified 1282 proteins with 745 of them (57.8%) being present in all seven prostasome pools. Forty-seven of those commonly present proteins showed differential expression levels in both cohorts. Specifically, prostasomes from non-normozoospermic samples showed a pattern of protein underexpression for a group of proteins including several proteins from the spermatozoa's energy production pathways as well as some proteins directly implicated in sperm activity. Variations in prostasomal protein content levels may have a relevant correlation with male fertility and thus could be of great utility as a biomarker of fertility status.

Electronic address: .	f.piacenza@inrca.it		Measuring zinc in biological nanovesicles by multiple analytical approaches.	J Trace Elem Med Biol	2018	Exosomes are nanovesicles known to mediate intercellular communication. Although it is established that zinc ions can act as intracellular signaling factors, the measurement of zinc in circulating nanovesicles has not yet been attempted. Providing evidence of the existence of this zinc fraction and methods for its measurement might be important to advance our knowledge of zinc status and its relevance in diseases. Exosomes from 0.5 ml of either fresh or frozen human plasma were isolated by differential centrifugation. A morphological and dimensional evaluation at the nanoscale level was performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Energy Dispersive X-Ray Microanalysis (EDX) revealed the elemental composition of exosomes and their respective total Zinc content on a quantitative basis. The zinc mole fraction (in at%) was correlated to the phosphorous mole fraction, which is indicative for exosomal membrane material. Both fresh (Zn/P 0.09 ± 0.01) and frozen exosomes (Zn/P 0.08 ± 0.02) had a significant zinc content, which increased up to 1.09 ± 0.12 for frozen exosomes when treated with increasing amounts of zinc (100-500 μM; each p < 0.05). Interestingly, after zinc addition, the Calcium mole fractions decreased accordingly suggesting a possible exchange by zinc. In order to estimate the intra-exosomal labile zinc content, an Imaging Flow Cytometry approach was developed by using the specific membrane permeable zinc-probe Fluozin-3AM. A labile zinc content of 0.59 ± 0.27 nM was calculated but it is likely that the measurement may be affected by purification and isolation conditions. This study suggests that circulating nano-vesicular-zinc can represent a newly discovered zinc fraction in the blood plasma whose functional and biological properties will have to be further investigated in future studies.

J Immunother	2003 Sep-Oct	Exosomes secreted by dendritic cells (DCs) contain MHC-I, MHC-II, and other accessory molecules required for antigen presentation to T cells. Previous studies have shown that exosome MHC-I "indirectly" loaded by adding peptides to DC cultures are immunogenic. However, analysis of peptide binding was not performed to link T-cell-stimulating activity with the amount of MHC-I/peptide complexes on the exosomes. In this study, we measured peptide binding to MHC-I under different loading conditions and tested the exosomes' potencies in T-cell activation assays. We demonstrate that MHC-I on purified exosomes can be directly loaded with peptide at much greater levels than indirect loading. The direct loading method performed in mildly acidic conditions was effective even in the absence of exogenous beta2m. This increase in peptide binding greatly enhanced exosome potency, allowing us to further study the biologic activity of exosomes in vitro. In the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APC), exosomes directly loaded with the HLA-A2 restricted MART1 tumor peptide stimulated an HLA-A2/MART1 specific T-cell line. The T cells responded to exosomes using HLA-A2neg APC, demonstrating transfer of functional MHC-I/peptide complexes and not peptide alone to APC. MHC-II molecules, which are abundantly expressed on DC exosomes, were also functionally loaded under the same conditions as MHC-I. This feature allows for delivery of multiple peptide antigens that can stimulate both CD8+ cytotoxic T cells as well CD4+ T helper cells critical for an effective antitumor response. The optimized loading conditions and the ability to transfer both MHC-I and MHC-II antigens to APC have led to the development of exosomes as an "acellular" immunotherapy approach currently being tested in clinical trials.

Mast cell-derived exosomes activate endothelial cells to secrete plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1.	Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol	2005	OBJECTIVE: Previous studies supported the contribution of exosomes to an acellular mode of communication, leading to intercellular transfer of molecules. In this study we provide evidence that mast cell-derived exosomes induce plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) expression in endothelial cells, detectable at the level of PAI-1 mRNA and protein synthesis. The stimulating effect was also measured at the level of PAI-1 promoter activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: To identify components responsible for this activity, exosome proteins were separated by 2-dimensional PAGE, and protein spots were identified by microsequencing using electrospray (ISI-Q-TOF-Micromass) spectrometer. Components of 3 independent systems that can be involved in activation of endothelial cells, namely the prothrombinase complex, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and angiotensinogen precursors were identified. Procoagulant activity of exosomes was confirmed by a thrombin generation assay using a specific chromogenic substrate. Because the potential of mast cell-derived exosomes to induce PAI-1 expression was completely abolished by hirudin, thrombin generated on exosomes seems to be responsible for this activity. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that mast cell-derived exosomes via significant upregulation of PAI-1 secretion from endothelial cells may provide feedback between the characteristically increased PAI-1 levels and procoagulant states, both observed in diverse syndromes manifesting as endothelial cell dysfunction.

BJU Int	2006	OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether cellular exosomes liberated by prostatic cell lines in culture might be acting as the transport vehicles for the dietary antioxidant lycopene, known to be sequestered in the prostate gland and to reduce the risk of developing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer; its subsequent secretion into seminal plasma also confers protection to spermatozoa against oxidative free-radical damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using benign and malignant human prostatic cell culture models, we assessed the role that their exosomes (the putative in vitro analogues of prostasomes) might have in the transport of lycopene. RESULTS: Cells exposed to lycopene in vitro accumulated the molecule and secrete lycopene-enriched exosomes. This continued after the lycopene exposure was stopped. Extraction of lycopene from the exosomes, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography, confirmed nanogram quantities of lycopene per milligram of exosomal protein. Packaging into exosomes for export resulted in reduced degradation of this labile antioxidant, and therefore maximized the effectiveness of delivery to the sites of action. CONCLUSION: These results support the likelihood that these organelles act as the transport vehicles for this important lipophilic agent known to have a role in the chemoprevention of various urological pathologies such as BPH, prostate cancer and male infertility.

Reticulocyte-secreted exosomes bind natural IgM antibodies: involvement of a ROS-activatable endosomal phospholipase iPLA2.	Blood	2007	Reticulocytes release small membrane vesicles termed exosomes during their maturation into erythrocytes. It has been suggested that reticulocytes remodel the plasma membrane of the immature red cell during erythropoiesis by specifically eliminating various proteins. We report here that exosome release is associated with a physiologic cascade induced by the expression of a 15-lipoxygenase at the reticulocyte stage. We found that the phospholipase iPLA2 specifically associated with the endosomal and exosomal membranes could be activated by reactive oxygen species (ROSs) produced during mitochondria degeneration induced by 15-lipoxygenase. Since iPLA2 has recently been demonstrated to participate in the clearance of apoptotic cells, we investigated its role in vesicle removal. We found that exosomes isolated directly from the blood of an anemic rat or released during in vitro maturation of rat reticulocytes bind IgM antibodies on their surface, in contrast to immature and mature red cells. These natural IgM antibodies recognize lysophosphatidylcholine and are able to specifically bind to apoptotic cells. Finally, evidence of C3 deposition on the exosome surface leads us to hypothesize that this cascade may favor the clearance of exosomes by cells once released into the bloodstream, via a mechanism similar to that involved in the elimination of apoptotic cells.

Difference gel electrophoresis analysis of Ras-transformed fibroblast cell-derived exosomes.	Electrophoresis	2008	Exosomes are membrane vesicles of endocytic origin released by many cell types. The molecular composition of exosomes reflects the specialised functions of their original cells. For example, these vesicles can mediate communication through their ability to bind to target cells, facilitating processes such as vascular homeostasis and antigen presentation. Although the proteomes of exosomes from several cell types are known, exploration of exosomes from additional cell types may improve our understanding of their potential physiological roles. Here, we describe the isolation and characterisation of exosomes isolated from the culture medium of murine fibroblast NIH3T3 cells and Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. The vesicular nature and size (30-100 nm) of the purified fibroblast exosomes was confirmed by electron microscopy. 2-D difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) was used to compare protein profiles of exosomes secreted from NIH3T3 cells and Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. LC-MS/MS sequencing identified proteins in 188 protein spots in the exosomes from the two cell lines, many of which have been previously identified in exosomes from other cell types. However, some proteins identified are novel for fibroblast exosomes, such as Serpin B6. Over 34 proteins, including milk fat globule EGF factor 8 (lactadherin), collagen alpha-1 (VI), 14-3-3 isoforms, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), the eukaryotic translation initiation factors elF-3 gamma and elF-5A accumulated (>2-fold) in exosomes upon Ras-induced oncogenic transformation. Significantly, the 10.4-fold increase in v-Ha-Ras p21 protein in exosomes derived from Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells suggests that exosome secretion may be implicated in eradication of obsolete proteins.

Cytomegalovirus-infected human endothelial cells can stimulate allogeneic CD4+ memory T cells by releasing antigenic exosomes.	J Immunol	2009	Human CMV infection is controlled by T cell-mediated immunity and in immunosuppressed transplant patients it is associated with acute allograft rejection as well as chronic allograft vasculopathy. CMV infects endothelial cells (EC) and it is thought that CMV-specific host immune responses to infected allograft EC contribute to rejection. In vitro, CD4(+) T cells from CMV-positive donors (but not CMV-negative donors) are readily activated by CMV-infected allogeneic EC, although it is unclear how allogeneic CMV-infected EC activate self-class II MHC-restricted memory CD4(+) T cells. In this study, we confirm that purified CD4(+) T cells from CMV(+) donors are activated by allogeneic CMV-infected EC, but find that the response is dependent upon copurified APC expressing class II MHC that are autologous to the T cells. The transfer of CMV Ags from infected EC to APC can be mediated by EC-derived exosome-like particles. These results provide a mechanism by which CMV can exacerbate allograft rejection and suggest a novel function of EC-derived exosomes that could contribute in a more general manner to immune surveillance.

Gynecol Oncol	2009	OBJECTIVE: Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at advanced stage (67%) and prospects for significant improvement in survival reside in early diagnosis. Our objective was to validate our array assay for the identification of ovarian cancer based on quantitation of tumor-reactive IgG. METHODS: The diagnostic array utilizes specific exosome-derived antigens to detect reactive IgG in patients' sera. Specific protein targets were isolated by immunoaffinity from exosomes derived from ovarian tumor cell lines. Sera were obtained from age-matched female volunteers, women with benign ovarian disease and with ovarian cancer. Immunoreactivity was also compared between exosomal proteins and their recombinant counterparts. RESULTS: Sera from ovarian cancer patients exhibited significantly greater immunoreactivities than either normal controls or women with benign disease (both considered negative to all antigens tested). Reactivities with nucleophosmin, cathepsin D, p53, and SSX common antigen for patients with all stages of ovarian cancer were significantly higher than for controls and women with benign ovarian disease. Reactivity with placental type alkaline phosphatase, TAG 72, survivin, NY-ESO-1, GRP78, and Muc16 (CA125) allowed the differentiation between Stage III/IV and early stage ovarian cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitation of circulating tumor-reactive IgG can be used to identify the presence of ovarian cancer. The analyses of IgG recognition of specific exosomal antigens allows for the differentiation of women with benign ovarian masses from ovarian cancer, as well as distinguishing early and late stage ovarian cancers. Thus, the quantitative assessment of IgG reactive with specific tumor-derived exosomal proteins can be used as diagnostic markers for ovarian cancer.	PMC2760307

Eukaryot Cell	2010	The growth, survival, and life cycle progression of the freshwater ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila are responsive to protein signals thought to be released by constitutive secretion. In addition to providing insights about ciliate communication, studies of constitutive secretion are of interest for evaluating the utility of T. thermophila as a platform for the expression of secreted protein therapeutics. For these reasons, we undertook an unbiased investigation of T. thermophila secreted proteins using wild-type and secretion mutant strains. Extensive tandem mass spectrometry analyses of secretome samples were performed. We identified a total of 207 secretome proteins, most of which were not detected in a set of abundant whole-cell protein identifications. Numerous proteases and other hydrolases were secreted from cells grown in rich medium but not cells transferred to a nutrient starvation condition. On the other hand, we detected the starvation-enhanced secretion of a small number of cytosolic proteins, suggestive of an exosome-like pathway in T. thermophila. Subsets of proteins from the T. thermophila regulated secretion pathway were detected with differential representation across strains and culture conditions. Finally, many secretome proteins had a predicted N-terminal signal sequence but no other annotated characteristic or functional classification. Our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of secreted proteins in T. thermophila and establishes the groundwork for future studies of constitutive protein secretion biology and biotechnology in ciliates.

Exosome release of β-catenin: a novel mechanism that antagonizes Wnt signaling.	J Cell Biol	2010	CD82 and CD9 are tetraspanin membrane proteins that can function as suppressors of tumor metastasis. Expression of CD9 and CD82 in transfected cells strongly suppresses β-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling activity and induces a significant decrease in β-catenin protein levels. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is independent of glycogen synthase kinase-3β and of the proteasome- and lysosome-mediated protein degradation pathways. CD82 and CD9 expression induces β-catenin export via exosomes, which is blocked by a sphingomyelinase inhibitor, GW4869. CD82 fails to induce exosome release of β-catenin in cells that express low levels of E-cadherin. Exosome release from dendritic cells generated from CD9 knockout mice is reduced compared with that from wild-type dendritic cells. These results suggest that CD82 and CD9 down-regulate the Wnt signaling pathway through the exosomal discharge of β-catenin. Thus, exosomal packaging and release of cytosolic proteins can modulate the activity of cellular signaling pathways.	PMC3101591

The pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis exports extracellular vesicles containing highly immunogenic α-Galactosyl epitopes.	Eukaryot Cell	2011	Exosome-like vesicles containing virulence factors, enzymes, and antigens have recently been characterized in fungal pathogens, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum. Here, we describe extracellular vesicles carrying highly immunogenic α-linked galactopyranosyl (α-Gal) epitopes in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. P. brasiliensis is a dimorphic fungus that causes human paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). For vesicle preparations, cell-free supernatant fluids from yeast cells cultivated in Ham's defined medium-glucose were concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration system and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g. P. brasiliensis antigens were present in preparations from phylogenetically distinct isolates Pb18 and Pb3, as observed in immunoblots revealed with sera from PCM patients. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), vesicle components containing α-Gal epitopes reacted strongly with anti-α-Gal antibodies isolated from both Chagas' disease and PCM patients, with Marasmius oreades agglutinin (MOA) (a lectin that recognizes terminal α-Gal), but only faintly with natural anti-α-Gal. Reactivity was inhibited after treatment with α-galactosidase. Vesicle preparations analyzed by electron microscopy showed vesicular structures of 20 to 200 nm that were labeled both on the surface and in the lumen with MOA. In P. brasiliensis cells, components carrying α-Gal epitopes were found distributed on the cell wall, following a punctuated confocal pattern, and inside large intracellular vacuoles. Lipid-free vesicle fractions reacted with anti-α-Gal in ELISA only when not digested with α-galactosidase, while reactivity with glycoproteins was reduced after β-elimination, which is indicative of partial O-linked chain localization. Our findings open new areas to explore in terms of host-parasite relationships in PCM and the role played in vivo by vesicle components and α-galactosyl epitopes.	PMC3067469

Loss of EpCAM expression in breast cancer derived serum exosomes: role of proteolytic cleavage.	Gynecol Oncol	2011	OBJECTIVE: Cancer cells in the body release soluble and membranous factors that manipulate the tumor environment to facilitate growth and survival. Recent years have provided evidence that small microvesicles that are termed exosomes may play a pivotal role in this process. Exosomes are membrane vesicles with a size of 40-100 nm that are released by both tumor and normal cells and can be found in various body fluids. Tumor-derived exosomes carry functional proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs and could serve as novel platform for tumor diagnosis and prognosis. However, marker proteins that allow enrichment of tumor-derived exosomes over normal exosomes are less well defined. METHODS: We used Western blot analysis and antibody coupled magnetic beads to characterize CD24 and EpCAM as markers for exosomes. We investigated ovarian carcinoma ascites, pleural effusions and serum of breast carcinoma patients. As non-tumor derived control we used exosomes from ascites of liver cirrhosis patients. RESULTS: Exosomes could be isolated from all body fluids and contained marker proteins as well as miRNAs. We observed that CD24 and EpCAM were selectively present on ascites exosomes of tumor patients and copurified together on anti-EpCAM or anti-CD24 magnetic beads. In breast cancer patients CD24 was present but EpCAM was absent from serum exosomes. Instead, the intact EpCAM ectodomain was recovered in a soluble form. We provide evidence that EpCAM can be cleaved from exosomes via serum metalloproteinase(s). CONCLUSION: Loss of EpCAM on serum exosomes may hamper enrichment by immune-affinity isolation. We suggest that CD24 could be an additional marker for the enrichment of tumor-derived exosomes from blood.

EBV-gp350 confers B-cell tropism to tailored exosomes and is a neo-antigen in normal and malignant B cells--a new option for the treatment of B-CLL.	PLoS One	2011	gp350, the major envelope protein of Epstein-Barr-Virus, confers B-cell tropism to the virus by interacting with the B lineage marker CD21. Here we utilize gp350 to generate tailored exosomes with an identical tropism. These exosomes can be used for the targeted co-transfer of functional proteins to normal and malignant human B cells. We demonstrate here the co-transfer of functional CD154 protein on tailored gp350+ exosomes to malignant B blasts from patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), rendering B blasts immunogenic to tumor-reactive autologous T cells. Intriguingly, engulfment of gp350+ exosomes by B-CLL cells and presentation of gp350-derived peptides also re-stimulated EBV-specific T cells and redirected the strong antiviral cellular immune response in patients to leukemic B cells. In essence, we show that gp350 alone confers B-cell tropism to exosomes and that these exosomes can be further engineered to simultaneously trigger virus- and tumor-specific immune responses. The simultaneous exploitation of gp350 as a tropism molecule for tailored exosomes and as a neo-antigen in malignant B cells provides a novel attractive strategy for immunotherapy of B-CLL and other B-cell malignancies.

Air2p is critical for the assembly and RNA-binding of the TRAMP complex and the KOW domain of Mtr4p is crucial for exosome activation.	Nucleic Acids Res	2012	Trf4/5p-Air1/2p-Mtr4p polyadenylation complex (TRAMP) is an essential component of nuclear RNA surveillance in yeast. It recognizes a variety of nuclear transcripts produced by all three RNA polymerases, adds short poly(A) tails to aberrant or unstable RNAs and activates the exosome for their degradation. Despite the advances in understanding the structural features of the isolated complex subunits or their fragments, the details of complex assembly, RNA recognition and exosome activation remain poorly understood. Here we provide the first understanding of the RNA binding mode of the complex. We show that Air2p is an RNA-binding subunit of TRAMP. We identify the zinc knuckles (ZnK) 2, 3 and 4 as the RNA-binding domains, and reveal the essentiality of ZnK4 for TRAMP4 polyadenylation activity. Furthermore, we identify Air2p as the key component of TRAMP4 assembly providing bridging between Mtr4p and Trf4p. The former is bound via the N-terminus of Air2p, while the latter is bound via ZnK5, the linker between ZnK4 and 5 and the C-terminus of the protein. Finally, we uncover the RNA binding part of the Mtr4p arch, the KOW domain, as the essential component for TRAMP-mediated exosome activation.	PMC3384339

Validation of a novel secretion modification region (SMR) of HIV-1 Nef using cohort sequence analysis and molecular modeling.	J Mol Model	2012	The HIV-1 accessory protein Nef plays an active role in the pathogenesis of AIDS by its numerous cellular interactions that facilitate the release of virus particles. This 27 kDa protein is required for maintenance of the viral replication in HIV, and is also known to contribute to immune evasion, blocking of apoptosis in virus-infected cells and enhancement of virus infectivity. Nef has been shown to be secreted and is present on the surface of virus-infected cells. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that the Nef protein is secreted from nef-transfected and HIV-1-infected cells in small exosome-like vesicles (40-100 nm diam.) that do not contain virions. We have identified three amino-terminal domains of Nef as necessary for secretion: (i) the four arginine residues (17,19,21, 22) comprising the basic region; (ii) the phosphofurin acidic cluster sequence (PACS) composed of four glutamic acid residues (61-64); (iii) a previously unknown motif spanning amino acid residues 65-69 (VGFPV) which we named the secretion modification region (SMR). In this study, we have used population-based phylogeny data and sequence analysis to characterize the conservation of the Nef SMR domain that regulates vesicle secretion. We have performed in silico computational chemistry analysis involving molecular dynamic structure modeling of mutations in the SMR motif. Sequence analysis of Nef from HIV-1-infected patients, including slow progressors (SP), long term progressors (LTP) and long term non-progressors (LTNP) demonstrated 99 % conservation of the Nef SMR motif. Computational analysis including modeling of wild-type HIV-1 Nef and V66A Nef SMR mutant using structural homology and molecular dynamics of ligand-associated interactions indicated significant structural changes in the Nef mutant, thus supporting the importance of the SMR domain for mediating Nef vesicle secretion.

PLoS One	2012	Breast milk is the primary source of nutrition for newborns, and is rich in immunological components. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are present in various body fluids and are selectively packaged inside the exosomes, a type of membrane vesicles, secreted by most cell types. These exosomal miRNAs could be actively delivered into recipient cells, and could regulate target gene expression and recipient cell function. Here, we analyzed the lactation-related miRNA expression profiles in porcine milk exosomes across the entire lactation period (newborn to 28 days after birth) by a deep sequencing. We found that immune-related miRNAs are present and enriched in breast milk exosomes (p<10(-16), χ(2) test) and are generally resistant to relatively harsh conditions. Notably, these exosomal miRNAs are present in higher numbers in the colostrums than in mature milk. It was higher in the serum of colostrum-only fed piglets compared with the mature milk-only fed piglets. These immune-related miRNA-loaded exosomes in breast milk may be transferred into the infant body via the digestive tract. These observations are a prelude to in-depth investigations of the essential roles of breast milk in the development of the infant's immune system.	PMC3427246

Cell Commun Signal	2012	BACKGROUND: Tumor-exosomes being reported to suppress or promote a cancer-directed immune response, we used exosomes of the rat pancreatic adenocarcinoma BSp73ASML (ASML) to evaluate, whether and which steps in immune response induction can be affected by tumor-exosomes and how the impaired responsiveness can be circumvented. RESULTS: ASML-exosomes bind to and are taken up by all leukocyte subpopulations in vivo and in vitro, uptake by CD11b+ leukocytes exceeding that by T and B cells. ASML-exosomes affect leukocyte proliferation via reduced CD44v6 up-regulation and lck, ZAP70 and ERK1,2 phosphorylation, which can be compensated by dendritic cells (DC). ASML-exosomes do not support Treg. Yet, impaired activation of anti-apoptotic signals is accompanied by slightly increased apoptosis susceptibility. IgM secretion is unaffected; NK and CTL activity are strengthened, ASML-exosomes co-operating with DC in CTL activation. ASML-exosomes transiently interfere with leukocyte migration by occupying migration-promoting receptors CD44, CD49d, CD62L and CD54 during binding/internalization. CONCLUSION: ASML-exosomes might well serve as adjuvant in immunotherapy as they support leukocyte effector functions and have only a minor impact on leukocyte activation, which can be overridden by DC. However, exosome-induced modulation of immune cells relies, at least in part, on exosome uptake and message transfer. This implies that depending on the individual tumor's exosome composition, exosomes may distinctly affect the immune system. Nonetheless, whether immunotherapy can profit from using tumor-exosomes as adjuvant can easily be settled beforehand in vitro.	PMC3519567

Int J Mol Sci	2013	Cell to cell communication is essential for the coordination and proper organization of different cell types in multicellular systems. Cells exchange information through a multitude of mechanisms such as secreted growth factors and chemokines, small molecules (peptides, ions, bioactive lipids and nucleotides), cell-cell contact and the secretion of extracellular matrix components. Over the last few years, however, a considerable amount of experimental evidence has demonstrated the occurrence of a sophisticated method of cell communication based on the release of specialized membranous nano-sized vesicles termed exosomes. Exosome biogenesis involves the endosomal compartment, the multivesicular bodies (MVB), which contain internal vesicles packed with an extraordinary set of molecules including enzymes, cytokines, nucleic acids and different bioactive compounds. In response to stimuli, MVB fuse with the plasma membrane and vesicles are released in the extracellular space where they can interact with neighboring cells and directly induce a signaling pathway or affect the cellular phenotype through the transfer of new receptors or even genetic material. This review will focus on exosomes as intercellular signaling organelles involved in a number of physiological as well as pathological processes and their potential use in clinical diagnostics and therapeutics.

Synergistic induction of adaptive antitumor immunity by codelivery of antigen with α-galactosylceramide on exosomes.	Cancer Res	2013	Exosomes and the invariant NKT (iNKT) immune cell ligand α-galactosylceramide (αGC) may offer novel tools for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we investigated whether exosomes loaded with αGC can activate iNKT cells and potentiate a cancer-specific adaptive immune response. αGC loaded exosomes readily activated iNKT cells both in vitro and in vivo. Exosomes loaded with αGC plus the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) induced potent NK and γδ T-cell innate immune responses, and they also synergistically amplified T- and B-cell responses that were OVA specific. In contrast to soluble αGC, which anergizes iNKT cells, we found that αGC/OVA-loaded exosomes did not induce iNKT cell anergy but were more potent than soluble αGC + OVA in inducing adaptive immune responses. In an OVA-expressing mouse model of melanoma, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with αGC/OVA-loaded exosomes decreased tumor growth, increased antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell tumor infiltration, and increased median survival, relative to control mice immunized with soluble αGC + OVA alone. Notably, an additional injection of αGC/OVA-loaded exosomes further augmented the treatment effects. Our findings show that exosomes loaded with protein antigen and αGC will activate adaptive immunity in the absence of triggering iNKT-cell anergy, supporting their application in the design of a broad variety of cancer immunotherapy trials.

Proteomic identification of galectin-3 binding ligands and characterization of galectin-3 proteolytic cleavage in human prostasomes.	Andrology	2013	Galectin-3 is a multifunctional carbohydrate-binding protein that was previously characterized as a proteolytic substrate for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and was shown to be associated with prostasomes in human semen. Prostasomes are exosome-like vesicles that are secreted by the prostatic epithelium and have multiple proposed functions in normal reproduction and prostate cancer. In the current study, galectin-3 binding ligands in human prostasomes were identified and characterized with the goal to investigate galectin-3 function in prostasomes. Galectin-3 binding proteins were isolated by affinity column chromatography. Candidate ligands identified by MS/MS were PSA, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), zinc alpha-2-glycoprotein (ZAG), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (CD26), aminopeptidase N (CD13), neprilysin, clusterin, antibacterial protein (FALL-39) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (ORM1). Biochemical methods were used to characterize the ability of galectin-3 to bind to selected ligands, and galectin-3 cleavage assays were utilized to investigate the protease(s) in prostasomes that cleaves galectin-3. CD26, CD13, PSA, PAP and ZAG immunoreactivity were detected in extracts of purified prostasomes. One-dimensional electroblot analysis of prostasomes demonstrated that CD26, PAP and CD13 immunoreactivity co-migrated with galectin-3-reactive protein bands. PSA and ZAG were found to be associated with the surface of prostasomes. Both intact and cleaved galectin-3 were detected in prostate and prostasome extracts. Cleavage and inhibition assays indicated that PSA in prostasomes proteolytically cleaves galectin-3. The identification of these glycoproteins as galectin-3 ligands lays the groundwork for future studies of galectin-3 and prostasome function in reproduction and prostate cancer.	PMC4180284

Growth factor stimulation of cardiomyocytes induces changes in the transcriptional contents of secreted exosomes.	J Extracell Vesicles	2013	Exosomes are nano-sized extracellular vesicles, released from various cells, which can stimulate or repress responses in targets cells. We recently reported that cultured cardiomyocytes are able to release exosomes and that they, in turn, are involved in facilitating events in target cells by alteration of gene expression. We investigated whether external stimuli of the cardiomyocyte might influence the transcriptional content of the released exosomes. Exosomes were isolated from media collected from cultured cardiomyocytes (HL-1) with or without growth factor treatment (TGF-β2 and PDGF-BB), with a series of differential centrifugations, including preparative ultracentrifugation and separation with a sucrose gradient. The exosomes were characterized with dynamic light scattering (DLS), electron microscopy (EM) and Western blot and analyzed with Illumina whole genome microarray gene expression. The exosomes were rounded in shape and had an average size of 50-90 nm in diameter with no difference between treatment groups. Analysis of the mRNA content in repeated experiments conclusively revealed 505 transcripts in the control group, 562 in the TGF-β2-treated group and 300 in the PDGF-BB-treated group. Common transcripts (217) were found in all 3 groups. We show that the mode of stimulation of parental cells affects the characteristics of exosomes released. Hence, there is a difference in mRNA content between exosomes derived from cultured cardiomyocytes stimulated, or not stimulated, with growth factors. We also conclude that all exosomes contain a basic package consisting of ribosomal transcripts and mRNAs coding for proteins with functions within the energy supply system.	PMC3760655

Extracellular Vesicle-Mediated Transfer of a Novel Long Noncoding RNA TUC339: A Mechanism of Intercellular Signaling in Human Hepatocellular Cancer.	Genes Cancer	2013	Although the expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is altered in hepatocellular cancer (HCC), their biological effects are poorly defined. We have identified lncRNA with highly conserved sequences, ultraconserved lncRNA (ucRNA) that are transcribed and altered in expression in HCC. Extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes and microvesicles, are released from tumor cells and can transfer biologically active proteins and RNA across cells. We sought to identify the role of vesicle-mediated transfer of ucRNA as a mechanism by which these novel lncRNA could influence intercellular signaling with potential for environmental modulation of tumor cell behavior. HCC-derived extracellular vesicles could be isolated from cells in culture and taken up by adjacent cells. The expression of several ucRNA was dramatically altered within extracellular vesicles compared to that in donor cells. The most highly significantly expressed ucRNA in HCC cell-derived extracellular vesicles was cloned and identified as a 1,198-bp ucRNA, termed TUC339. TUC339 was functionally implicated in modulating tumor cell growth and adhesion. Suppression of TUC339 by siRNA reduced HCC cell proliferation, clonogenic growth, and growth in soft agar. Thus, intercellular transfer of TUC339 represents a unique signaling mechanism by which tumor cells can promote HCC growth and spread. These findings expand the potential roles of ucRNA in HCC, support the existence of selective mechanisms for lncRNA export from cells, and implicate extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer of lncRNA as a mechanism by which tumor cells can modulate their local cellular environment. Intercellular transfer of functionally active RNA molecules by extracellular vesicles provides a mechanism that enables cells to exert genetic influences on other cells within the microenvironment.

Biomaterials	2014	Targeted drug delivery vehicles with low immunogenicity and toxicity are needed for cancer therapy. Here we show that exosomes, endogenous nano-sized membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types, can deliver chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Dox) to tumor tissue in BALB/c nude mice. To reduce immunogenicity and toxicity, mouse immature dendritic cells (imDCs) were used for exosome production. Tumor targeting was facilitated by engineering the imDCs to express a well-characterized exosomal membrane protein (Lamp2b) fused to αv integrin-specific iRGD peptide (CRGDKGPDC). Purified exosomes from imDCs were loaded with Dox via electroporation, with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 20%. iRGD exosomes showed highly efficient targeting and Dox delivery to αv integrin-positive breast cancer cells in vitro as demonstrated by confocal imaging and flow cytometry. Intravenously injected targeted exosomes delivered Dox specifically to tumor tissues, leading to inhibition of tumor growth without overt toxicity. Our results suggest that exosomes modified by targeting ligands can be used therapeutically for the delivery of Dox to tumors, thus having great potential value for clinical applications.

Differentiation of tumour-promoting stromal myofibroblasts by cancer exosomes.	Oncogene	2015	Activation of myofibroblast rich stroma is a rate-limiting step essential for cancer progression. The responsible factors are not fully understood, but TGFβ1 is probably critical. A proportion of TGFβ1 is associated with extracellular nano-vesicles termed exosomes, secreted by carcinoma cells, and the relative importance of soluble and vesicular TGFβ in stromal activation is presented. Prostate cancer exosomes triggered TGFβ1-dependent fibroblast differentiation, to a distinctive myofibroblast phenotype resembling stromal cells isolated from cancerous prostate tissue; supporting angiogenesis in vitro and accelerating tumour growth in vivo. Myofibroblasts generated using soluble TGFβ1 were not pro-angiogenic or tumour-promoting. Cleaving heparan sulphate side chains from the exosome surface had no impact on TGFβ levels yet attenuated SMAD-dependent signalling and myofibroblastic differentiation. Eliminating exosomes from the cancer cell secretome, targeting Rab27a, abolished differentiation and lead to failure in stroma-assisted tumour growth in vivo. Exosomal TGFβ1 is therefore required for the formation of tumour-promoting stroma.

Electronic address: .	flecanda@unav.es		miRNA cargo within exosome-like vesicle transfer influences metastatic bone colonization.	Mol Oncol	2014	Bone metastasis represents one of the most deleterious clinical consequences arising in the context of many solid tumors. Severe osteolysis results from tumor cell colonization of the bone compartment, a process which entails reciprocal exchange of soluble signals between tumor cells and their osseous microenvironment. Recent evidence indicates that tumor-intrinsic miRNAs are pleiotropic regulators of gene expression. But they are also frequently released in exosome-like vesicles (ELV). Yet the functional relevance of the transference of tumor-derived ELV and their miRNA cargo to the extracellular milieu during osseous colonization is unknown. Comparative transcriptomic profiling using an in vivo murine model of bone metastasis identified a repressed miRNA signature associated with high prometastatic activity. Forced expression of single miRNAs identified miR-192 that markedly appeased osseous metastasis in vivo, as shown by X-ray, bioluminescence imaging and microCT scans. Histological examination of metastatic lesions revealed impaired tumor-induced angiogenesis in vivo, an effect that was associated in vitro with decreased hallmarks of angiogenesis. Isolation and characterization of ELV by flow cytometry, Western blot analysis, transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed the ELV cargo enrichment in miR-192. Consistent with these findings, fluorescent labeled miR-192-enriched-ELV showed the in vitro transfer and release of miR-192 in target endothelial cells and abrogation of the angiogenic program by repression of proangiogenic IL-8, ICAM and CXCL1. Moreover, in vivo infusion of fluorescent labeled ELV efficiently targeted cells of the osseous compartment. Furthermore, treatment with miR-192 enriched ELV in a model of in vivo bone metastasis pre-conditioned osseous milieu and impaired tumor-induced angiogenesis, thereby reducing the metastatic burden and tumor colonization. Changes in the miRNA-cargo content within ELV represent a novel mechanism heavily influencing bone metastatic colonization, which is most likely relevant in other target organs. Mechanistic mimicry of this phenomenon by synthetic nanoparticles could eventually emerge as a novel therapeutic approach.	PMC5528646

Electronic address: .	n0tyag01@louisville.edu		Curcumin-primed exosomes mitigate endothelial cell dysfunction during hyperhomocysteinemia.	Life Sci	2014	AIM: Exosomes, the nano-units (<200 nm), released from diverse cell types in the extracellular body fluid, possess non-immunogenic property and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Since exosomes carry biological information from their cells of origin, we hypothesize that priming cells with potential therapeutic agents release improved cellular contents through exosomes. Curcumin possesses anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties and provides a promising treatment for cerebral diseases and therefore, the aim of the study is to establish that mouse brain endothelial cells (MBECs) when primed with curcumin (7.5 μM), release an alleviated exosome population that can help recover the endothelial cell (EC) layer permeability. MAIN METHODS: Homocysteine is a well-known causative factor of BBB disruption; therefore, homocysteine-treated ECs were used as a model of BBB disruption and curcumin-primed exosomes were utilized to check their potential for mitigating EC disruption. MBECs were treated with curcumin and exosomes were isolated by using ultracentrifugation and immunoprecipitation. Expression levels of junction proteins were detected by Western blot and immunocytochemistry assays. Endothelial cell permeability was analyzed with Fluorescein isothiocyanate-Bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) leakage assay using transwell permeable supports. KEY FINDINGS: Exosomes derived from curcumin-treated (primed) cells (CUR-EXO) alleviated oxidative stress, tight junctions (ZO-1, claudin-5, occludin), adherent junction (VE-cadherin) proteins and EC layer permeability induced during EC damage due to high homocysteine levels (hyperhomocysteinemia). SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, the study potentiates the use of CUR-EXO for cerebral diseases where drug delivery is still a challenge. The results also pave the way to novel translational therapies for cerebral diseases by maintaining and establishing therapeutic conservatories via primed exosomes.	PMC4075120

A gestational profile of placental exosomes in maternal plasma and their effects on endothelial cell migration.	PLoS One	2014	Studies completed to date provide persuasive evidence that placental cell-derived exosomes play a significant role in intercellular communication pathways that potentially contribute to placentation and development of materno-fetal vascular circulation. The aim of this study was to establish the gestational-age release profile and bioactivity of placental cell-derived exosome in maternal plasma. Plasma samples (n = 20 per pregnant group) were obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women in the first (FT, 6-12 weeks), second (ST, 22-24 weeks) and third (TT, 32-38 weeks) trimester. The number of exosomes and placental exosome contribution were determined by quantifying immunoreactive exosomal CD63 and placenta-specific marker (PLAP), respectively. The effect of exosomes isolated from FT, ST and TT on endothelial cell migration were established using a real-time, live-cell imaging system (Incucyte). Exosome plasma concentration was more than 50-fold greater in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women (p<0.001). During normal healthy pregnancy, the number of exosomes present in maternal plasma increased significantly with gestational age by more that two-fold (p<0.001). Exosomes isolated from FT, ST and TT increased endothelial cell migration by 1.9±0.1, 1.6±0.2 and 1.3±0.1-fold, respectively compared to the control. Pregnancy is associated with a dramatic increase in the number of exosomes present in plasma and maternal plasma exosomes are bioactive. While the role of placental cell-derived exosome in regulating maternal and/or fetal vascular responses remains to be elucidated, changes in exosome profile may be of clinical utility in the diagnosis of placental dysfunction.

Sci Signal	2014	Breast cancer patients often develop metastatic disease years after resection of the primary tumor. The patients are asymptomatic because the disseminated cells appear to become dormant and are undetectable. Because the proliferation of these cells is slowed, dormant cells are often unresponsive to traditional chemotherapies that exploit the rapid cell cycling of most cancer cells. We generated a bone marrow-metastatic human breast cancer cell line (BM2) by tracking and isolating fluorescent-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells that disseminated to the bone marrow in mice. Coculturing BM2 cells with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) isolated from human donors revealed that BM-MSCs suppressed the proliferation of BM2 cells, decreased the abundance of stem cell-like surface markers, inhibited their invasion through Matrigel Transwells, and decreased their sensitivity to docetaxel, a common chemotherapy agent. Acquisition of these dormant phenotypes in BM2 cells was also observed by culturing the cells in BM-MSC-conditioned medium or with exosomes isolated from BM-MSC cultures, which were taken up by BM2 cells. Among various microRNAs (miRNAs) increased in BM-MSC-derived exosomes compared with those from adult fibroblasts, overexpression of miR-23b in BM2 cells induced dormant phenotypes through the suppression of a target gene, MARCKS, which encodes a protein that promotes cell cycling and motility. Metastatic breast cancer cells in patient bone marrow had increased miR-23b and decreased MARCKS expression. Together, these findings suggest that exosomal transfer of miRNAs from the bone marrow may promote breast cancer cell dormancy in a metastatic niche.

Galectin-3, a biomarker linking oxidative stress and inflammation with the clinical outcomes of patients with atherothrombosis.	J Am Heart Assoc	2014	BACKGROUND: Galectin-3 (Gal-3) participates in different mechanisms involved in atherothrombosis, such as inflammation, proliferation, or macrophage chemotaxis. Thus, there have been committed intensive efforts to elucidate the function of Gal-3 in cardiovascular (CV) diseases. The role of Gal-3 as a circulating biomarker has been demonstrated in patients with heart failure, but its importance as a biomarker in atherothrombosis is still unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Because Gal-3 is involved in monocyte-to-macrophage transition, we used fresh isolated monocytes and the in vitro model of macrophage differentiation of THP-1 cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Gal-3 release is increased by PMA in human monocytes and macrophages, a process involving exosomes and regulated by reactive oxygen species/NADPH oxidase activity. In asymptomatic subjects (n=199), Gal-3 plasma levels are correlated with NADPH oxidase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (r=0.476; P<0.001) and carotid intima-media thickness (r=0.438; P<0.001), a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis. Accordingly, Gal-3 plasma concentrations are increased in patients with carotid atherosclerosis (n=158), compared to control subjects (n=115; 14.3 [10.7 to 16.9] vs. 10.4 [8.6 to 12.5] ng/mL; P<0.001). Finally, on a 5-year follow-up study in patients with peripheral artery disease, Gal-3 concentrations are significantly and independently associated with an increased risk for CV mortality (hazard ratio=2.24, 95% confidence interval: 1.06 to 4.73, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Gal-3 extracellular levels could reflect key underlying mechanisms involved in atherosclerosis etiology, development, and plaque rupture, such as inflammation, infiltration of circulating cells and oxidative stress. Moreover, circulating Gal-3 concentrations are associated with clinical outcomes in patients with atherothrombosis.	PMC4310363

Eur Cell Mater	2014	Despite the popularity of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet lysate (PL) in orthopaedic practice, the mechanism of action and the effectiveness of these therapeutic tools are still controversial. So far, the activity of PRP and PL has been associated with different growth factors (GF) released during platelet degranulation. This study, for the first time, identifies exosomes, nanosized vesicles released in the extracellular compartment by a number of elements, including platelets, as one of the effectors of PL activity. Exosomes were isolated from human PL by differential ultracentrifugation, and analysed by electron microscopy and Western blotting. Bone marrow stromal cells (MSC) treated with three different exosome concentrations (0.6 μg, 5 μg and 50 μg) showed a significant, dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation and migration compared to the control. In addition, osteogenic differentiation assays demonstrated that exosome concentration differently affected the ability of MSC to deposit mineralised matrix. Finally, the analysis of exosome protein content revealed a higher amount of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) as compared to PL. In regards to RNA content, an enrichment of small RNAs in exosomes as compared to donor platelets has been found. These results suggest that exosomes consistently contribute to PL activity and could represent an advantageous nanodelivery system for cell-free regeneration therapies.

Quantitative analysis of tissue distribution of the B16BL6-derived exosomes using a streptavidin-lactadherin fusion protein and iodine-125-labeled biotin derivative after intravenous injection in mice.	J Pharm Sci	2015	We previously succeeded in the visualization of tissue distribution of B16BL6 cells-derived exosomes by labeling with Gaussia luciferase (gLuc)-LA, a fusion protein of gLuc (a reporter protein) and lactadherin (LA; an exosome-tropic protein). However, total amount of B16BL6-derived exosomes delivered to each organ could not be evaluated because of the reduction of luminescent signal from gLuc-LA. The aim of the present study was to quantitatively evaluate the tissue distribution of B16BL6-derived exosomes. To this end, we labeled B16BL6-derived exosomes with iodine-125 ((125) I) based on streptavidin (SAV)-biotin system. A plasmid vector encoding fusion protein, SAV-LA, was constructed, and B16BL6 cells were transfected with the plasmid to obtain SAV-LA-coupled exosomes. SAV-LA-coupled exosomes were incubated with (3-(125) I-iodobenzoyl) norbiotinamide ((125) I-IBB) to obtain (125) I-labeled B16BL6 exosomes. After intravenous injection of (125) I-labeled B16BL6 exosomes into mice, radioactivity quickly disappeared from the blood circulation. At 4 h, 28%, 1.6%, and 7% of the injected radioactivity/organ was detected in the liver, spleen, and lung, respectively. These results indicate that (125) I-labeling of exosomes using SAV-biotin system is a useful method to quantitatively evaluate the amount of exogenously administered exosomes delivered to each organ and that the liver is the major organ in the clearance of exogenously administered B16BL6-derived exosomes.

Cardiac endothelial cell-derived exosomes induce specific regulatory B cells.	Sci Rep	2014	The mechanism of immune tolerance is to be further understood. The present study aims to investigate the role of the Cardiac endothelial cell (CEC)-derived exosomes in the induction of regulatory B cells. In this study, CECs were isolated from the mouse heart. Exosomes were purified from the culture supernatant of the primary endothelial cells. The suppressor functions of the regulatory B cells were determined by flow cytometry. The results showed that the CEC-derived exosomes carried integrin αvβ6. Exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced B cells to express the latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, the latter was converted to the active form, TGF-β, by the exosome-derived αvβ6. The B cells released TGF-β in response to re-exposure to the exosomes in the culture, which suppressed the effector T cell proliferation. We conclude that CEC-derived exosomes have the capacity to induce B cells with immune suppressor functions.	PMC4274510

J Biol Chem	2015	Exosomes are secreted extracellular vesicles that mediate intercellular transfer of cellular contents and are attractive vehicles for therapeutic delivery of bimolecular cargo such as nucleic acids, proteins, and even drugs. Efficient exosome-mediated delivery in vivo requires targeting vesicles for uptake by specific recipient cells. Although exosomes have been successfully targeted to several cellular receptors by displaying peptides on the surface of the exosomes, identifying effective exosome-targeting peptides for other receptors has proven challenging. Furthermore, the biophysical rules governing targeting peptide success remain poorly understood. To evaluate one factor potentially limiting exosome delivery, we investigated whether peptides displayed on the exosome surface are degraded during exosome biogenesis, for example by endosomal proteases. Indeed, peptides fused to the N terminus of exosome-associated transmembrane protein Lamp2b were cleaved in samples derived from both cells and exosomes. To suppress peptide loss, we engineered targeting peptide-Lamp2b fusion proteins to include a glycosylation motif at various positions. Introduction of this glycosylation motif both protected the peptide from degradation and led to an increase in overall Lamp2b fusion protein expression in both cells and exosomes. Moreover, glycosylation-stabilized peptides enhanced targeted delivery of exosomes to neuroblastoma cells, demonstrating that such glycosylation does not ablate peptide-target interactions. Thus, we have identified a strategy for achieving robust display of targeting peptides on the surface of exosomes, which should facilitate the evaluation and development of new exosome-based therapeutics.

Proteomic analysis of exosomes from nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell identifies intercellular transfer of angiogenic proteins.	Int J Cancer	2015	Exosomes, a group of secreted extracellular nanovesicles containing genetic materials and signaling molecules, play a critical role in intercellular communication. During tumorigenesis, exosomes have been demonstrated to promote tumor angiogenesis and metastasis while their biological functions in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the role of NPC-derived exosomes on angiogenesis. Exosomes derived from the NPC C666-1 cells and immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (NP69 and NP460) were isolated using ultracentrifugation. The molecular profile and biophysical characteristics of exosomes were verified by Western blotting, sucrose density gradient and electron microscopy. We showed that the C666-1 exosomes (10 and 20 μg/ml) could significantly increase the tubulogenesis, migration and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequently, an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics was used to identify the differentially expressed proteins in C666-1 exosomes. Among the 640 identified proteins, 51 and 89 proteins were considered as up- and down-regulated (≥ 1.5-fold variations) in C666-1 exosomes compared to the normal counterparts, respectively. As expected, pro-angiogenic proteins including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and CD44 variant isoform 5 (CD44v5) are among the up-regulated proteins, whereas angio-suppressive protein, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) was down-regulated in C666-1 exosomes. Further confocal microscopic study and Western blotting clearly demonstrated that the alteration of ICAM-1 and TSP-1 expressions in recipient HUVECs are due to internalization of exosomes. Taken together, these data strongly indicated the critical roles of identified angiogenic proteins in the involvement of exosomes-induced angiogenesis, which could potentially be developed as therapeutic targets in future.

Exosomes Secreted from Human Cancer Cell Lines Contain Inhibitors of Apoptosis (IAP).	Cancer Microenviron	2015	Exosomes are endosomal-derived nanovesicles released by normal and tumor cells which have been shown to transfer functionally active protein, lipids, mRNAs and miRNAs between cells. Varying in molecular profiles, biological roles, functional roles and protein contents, exosomes have been described as "multi-purpose carriers" playing a role in supporting the survival and growth of tumor cells. The IAP Survivin has been found to be present in tumor exosomes. However, the existence of other IAPs in tumor exosomes is still unknown. Survivin, cIAP1, cIAP2 and XIAP mRNA and protein are differently expressed in a panel of tumor cell lines: DLCL2, HeLa, MCF-7, Panc-1, and PC3. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media collected from the cells from which RNA and protein were extracted. Our results provide evidence that like Survivin, XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 proteins are found in tumor exosomes. The mRNA expression, however, is differentially expressed across the tumor cell lines. The presence of these bioactive molecules in exosomes may not only serve as warning signals, but also play a role in providing protection to the cancer cells against changes that are constantly occurring in the tumor microenvironment.

Exosome-delivered microRNAs modulate the inflammatory response to endotoxin.	Nat Commun	2015	MicroRNAs regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and function within the cells in which they are transcribed. However, recent evidence suggests that microRNAs can be transferred between cells and mediate target gene repression. We find that endogenous miR-155 and miR-146a, two critical microRNAs that regulate inflammation, are released from dendritic cells within exosomes and are subsequently taken up by recipient dendritic cells. Following uptake, exogenous microRNAs mediate target gene repression and can reprogramme the cellular response to endotoxin, where exosome-delivered miR-155 enhances while miR-146a reduces inflammatory gene expression. We also find that miR-155 and miR-146a are present in exosomes and pass between immune cells in vivo, as well as demonstrate that exosomal miR-146a inhibits while miR-155 promotes endotoxin-induced inflammation in mice. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that endogenous microRNAs undergo a functional transfer between immune cells and constitute a mechanism of regulating the inflammatory response.

Mol Cancer	2015	BACKGROUND: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a natural compound with anticancer and anti-angiogenesis activity that is currently under investigation as both a preventative agent and an adjuvant to breast cancer therapy. However, the precise mechanisms of DHA's anticancer activities are unclear. It is understood that the intercommunication between cancer cells and their microenvironment is essential to tumor angiogenesis. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that are important mediators of intercellular communication and play a role in promoting angiogenesis. However, very little is known about the contribution of breast cancer exosomes to tumor angiogenesis or whether exosomes can mediate DHA's anticancer action. RESULTS: Exosomes were collected from MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells after treatment with DHA. We observed an increase in exosome secretion and exosome microRNA contents from the DHA-treated cells. The expression of 83 microRNAs in the MCF7 exosomes was altered by DHA (>2-fold). The most abundant exosome microRNAs (let-7a, miR-23b, miR-27a/b, miR-21, let-7, and miR-320b) are known to have anti-cancer and/or anti-angiogenic activity. These microRNAs were also increased by DHA treatment in the exosomes from other breast cancer lines (MDA-MB-231, ZR751 and BT20), but not in exosomes from normal breast cells (MCF10A). When DHA-treated MCF7 cells were co-cultured with or their exosomes were directly applied to endothelial cell cultures, we observed an increase in the expression of these microRNAs in the endothelial cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-23b and miR-320b in endothelial cells decreased the expression of their pro-angiogenic target genes (PLAU, AMOTL1, NRP1 and ETS2) and significantly inhibited tube formation by endothelial cells, suggesting that the microRNAs transferred by exosomes mediate DHA's anti-angiogenic action. These effects could be reversed by knockdown of the Rab GTPase, Rab27A, which controls exosome release. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that DHA alters breast cancer exosome secretion and microRNA contents, which leads to the inhibition of angiogenesis. Our data demonstrate that breast cancer exosome signaling can be targeted to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and provide new insight into DHA's anticancer action, further supporting its use in cancer therapy.

Characterization of RNA from Exosomes and Other Extracellular Vesicles Isolated by a Novel Spin Column-Based Method.	PLoS One	2015	Exosomes and other extracellular vesicles (commonly referred to as EVs) have generated a lot of attention for their potential applications in both diagnostics and therapeutics. The contents of these vesicles are the subject of intense research, and the relatively recent discovery of RNA inside EVs has raised interest in the biological function of these RNAs as well as their potential as biomarkers for cancer and other diseases. Traditional ultracentrifugation-based protocols to isolate EVs are labor-intensive and subject to significant variability. Various attempts to develop methods with robust, reproducible performance have not yet been completely successful. Here, we report the development and characterization of a spin column-based method for the isolation of total RNA from EVs in serum and plasma. This method isolates highly pure RNA of equal or higher quantity compared to ultracentrifugation, with high specificity for vesicular over non-vesicular RNA. The spin columns have a capacity to handle up to 4 mL sample volume, enabling detection of low-abundance transcripts in serum and plasma. We conclude that the method is an improvement over traditional methods in providing a faster, more standardized way to achieve reliable high quality RNA preparations from EVs in biofluids such as serum and plasma. The first kit utilizing this new method has recently been made available by Qiagen as "exoRNeasy Serum/Plasma Maxi Kit".	PMC4552735

Label-Free Nanoplasmonic-Based Short Noncoding RNA Sensing at Attomolar Concentrations Allows for Quantitative and Highly Specific Assay of MicroRNA-10b in Biological Fluids and Circulating Exosomes.	ACS Nano	2015	MicroRNAs are short noncoding RNAs consisting of 18-25 nucleotides that target specific mRNA moieties for translational repression or degradation, thereby modulating numerous biological processes. Although microRNAs have the ability to behave like oncogenes or tumor suppressors in a cell-autonomous manner, their exact roles following release into the circulation are only now being unraveled and it is important to establish sensitive assays to measure their levels in different compartments in the circulation. Here, an ultrasensitive localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-based microRNA sensor with single nucleotide specificity was developed using chemically synthesized gold nanoprisms attached onto a solid substrate with unprecedented long-term stability and reversibility. The sensor was used to specifically detect microRNA-10b at the attomolar (10(-18) M) concentration in pancreatic cancer cell lines, derived tissue culture media, human plasma, and media and plasma exosomes. In addition, for the first time, our label-free and nondestructive sensing technique was used to quantify microRNA-10b in highly purified exosomes isolated from patients with pancreatic cancer or chronic pancreatitis, and from normal controls. We show that microRNA-10b levels were significantly higher in plasma-derived exosomes from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients when compared with patients with chronic pancreatitis or normal controls. Our findings suggest that this unique technique can be used to design novel diagnostic strategies for pancreatic and other cancers based on the direct quantitative measurement of plasma and exosome microRNAs, and can be readily extended to other diseases with identifiable microRNA signatures.

Acta Neuropathol	2016	Extracellular alpha-synuclein (αsyn) oligomers, associated to exosomes or free, play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Increasing evidence suggests that these extracellular moieties activate microglia leading to enhanced neuronal damage. Despite extensive efforts on studying neuroinflammation in PD, little is known about the impact of age on microglial activation and phagocytosis, especially of extracellular αsyn oligomers. Here, we show that microglia isolated from adult mice, in contrast to microglia from young mice, display phagocytosis deficits of free and exosome-associated αsyn oligomers combined with enhanced TNFα secretion. In addition, we describe a dysregulation of monocyte subpopulations with age in mice and humans. Accordingly, human monocytes from elderly donors also show reduced phagocytic activity of extracellular αsyn. These findings suggest that these age-related alterations may contribute to an increased susceptibility to pathogens or abnormally folded proteins with age in neurodegenerative diseases.

Mitochondrial Inhibitory Factor Protein 1 Functions as an Endogenous Inhibitor for Coupling Factor 6.	J Cell Biochem	2016	Coupling factor 6 (CF6) forces a counter-clockwise rotation of plasma membrane F1 Fo complex unlike a proton-mediated clockwise rotation in the mitochondria, resulting in ATP hydrolysis, proton import, and apoptosis. Inhibitory peptide 1 (IF1) inhibits a unidirectional counter-clockwise rotation of F1 Fo complex without affecting ATP synthesis by a clockwise rotation. We tested the hypothesis that IF1 may antagonize the biological action of CF6 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. We generated mature and immature IF1 expression vectors and those labeled with GFP at the C-terminus. In the immature IF1-GFP overexpressing cells, the mitochondrial network of IF1-GFP was newly found at the plasma membrane after peripheral translocation, whereas in mature IF1-GFP transfected cells, a less punctuate rather homogenous pattern was found in the cytoplasm. IF1 protein was detected in the exosome fraction of culture media, and it was enhanced by mature or immature IF1 transfection. Extracellular ATP hydrolysis was enhanced by CF6, whereas immature or mature IF1 transfection suppressed ATP hydrolysis in response to CF6. Intracellular pH was decreased by CF6 but was unchanged after immature IF1 transfection. CF6-induced increase in apoptotic cells was blocked by immature or mature IF1, being accompanied by protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation. IF1 antagonizes the pro-apoptotic action of CF6 by relief of intracellular acidification and resultant phosphorylation of PKB. Given the widespread biological actions of CF6, the physiological and pathological functions of IF1 may be expected to be complex. J. Cell.

Anal Bioanal Chem	2016	MicroRNA molecules (miRNAs) are a class of small, single-stranded, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate cellular messenger RNA and their corresponding proteins. Extracellular miRNAs circulate in the bloodstream inside exosomes or in complexes with proteins and lipoproteins. The miRNA sequences and their quantitative levels are used as unique signatures associated with cancer diagnosis and prognosis after anticancer treatment. MicroRNAs are modified through a series of processing events after transcription like 5'-end phosphorylation, 3'- end adenylation or uridylation, terminal nucleotide deletion. The problem is that existing bioanalytical methods such as microarrays and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction are sensitive, but not capable of identifying the post-transcriptional modifications of miRNA. Here we report a capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) method, which performs a multiplex, direct analysis of miRNAs from biological samples. Using the CE-MS method, we detected two endogenous human circulating miRNAs, a 23-nucleotide long 5'-phosporylated miRNA with 3'-uridylation (iso-miR-16-5p), and a 22-nucleotide long 5'-phosporylated miRNA (miR-21-5p) isolated from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia serum. The CE separation and following MS analysis provides label-free quantitation and reveals modifications of miRNAs. MicroRNA profiling of serum samples with CE-MS has the potential to be a versatile and minimally invasive bioassay that could lead to better clinical diagnostics and disease treatment.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2016	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have become the focus of rising interest because of their numerous functions in physiology and pathology. Cells release heterogeneous vesicles of different sizes and intracellular origins, including small EVs formed inside endosomal compartments (i.e., exosomes) and EVs of various sizes budding from the plasma membrane. Specific markers for the analysis and isolation of different EV populations are missing, imposing important limitations to understanding EV functions. Here, EVs from human dendritic cells were first separated by their sedimentation speed, and then either by their behavior upon upward floatation into iodixanol gradients or by immuno-isolation. Extensive quantitative proteomic analysis allowing comparison of the isolated populations showed that several classically used exosome markers, like major histocompatibility complex, flotillin, and heat-shock 70-kDa proteins, are similarly present in all EVs. We identified proteins specifically enriched in small EVs, and define a set of five protein categories displaying different relative abundance in distinct EV populations. We demonstrate the presence of exosomal and nonexosomal subpopulations within small EVs, and propose their differential separation by immuno-isolation using either CD63, CD81, or CD9. Our work thus provides guidelines to define subtypes of EVs for future functional studies.	PMC4776515

Electronic address: .	philippe.menasche@aphp.fr		Cardiovascular progenitor-derived extracellular vesicles recapitulate the beneficial effects of their parent cells in the treatment of chronic heart failure.	J Heart Lung Transplant	2016	BACKGROUND: Cell-based therapies are being explored as a therapeutic option for patients with chronic heart failure following myocardial infarction. Extracellular vesicles (EV), including exosomes and microparticles, secreted by transplanted cells may orchestrate their paracrine therapeutic effects. We assessed whether post-infarction administration of EV released by human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiovascular progenitors (hESC-Pg) can provide equivalent benefits to administered hESC-Pg and whether hESC-Pg and EV treatments activate similar endogenous pathways. METHODS: Mice underwent surgical occlusion of their left coronary arteries. After 2-3 weeks, 95 mice included in the study were treated with hESC-Pg, EV, or Minimal Essential Medium Alpha Medium (alpha-MEM; vehicle control) delivered by percutaneous injections under echocardiographic guidance into the peri-infarct myocardium. functional and histologic end-points were blindly assessed 6 weeks later, and hearts were processed for gene profiling. Genes differentially expressed between control hearts and hESC-Pg-treated and EV-treated hearts were clustered into functionally relevant pathways. RESULTS: At 6 weeks after hESC-Pg administration, treated mice had significantly reduced left ventricular end-systolic (-4.20 ± 0.96 µl or -7.5%, p = 0.0007) and end-diastolic (-4.48 ± 1.47 µl or -4.4%, p = 0.009) volumes compared with baseline values despite the absence of any transplanted hESC-Pg or human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in the treated mouse hearts. Equal benefits were seen with the injection of hESC-Pg-derived EV, whereas animals injected with alpha-MEM (vehicle control) did not improve significantly. Histologic examination suggested a slight reduction in infarct size in hESC-Pg-treated animals and EV-treated animals compared with alpha-MEM-treated control animals. In the hESC-Pg-treated and EV-treated groups, heart gene profiling identified 927 genes that were similarly upregulated compared with the control group. Among the 49 enriched pathways associated with these up-regulated genes that could be related to cardiac function or regeneration, 78% were predicted to improve cardiac function through increased cell survival and/or proliferation or DNA repair as well as pathways related to decreased fibrosis and heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: In this post-infarct heart failure model, either hESC-Pg or their secreted EV enhance recovery of cardiac function and similarly affect cardiac gene expression patterns that could be related to this recovery. Although the mechanisms by which EV improve cardiac function remain to be determined, these results support the idea that a paracrine mechanism is sufficient to effect functional recovery in cell-based therapies for post-infarction-related chronic heart failure.

Hypoxic tumor-derived microvesicles negatively regulate NK cell function by a mechanism involving TGF-β and miR23a transfer.	Oncoimmunology	2016	Tumor-derived microvesicles (TD-MVs) are key mediators which are shed by cancer cells and can sensitize neighboring cells in the tumor microenvironment. TD-MVs are extracellular vesicles composed of exosomes and MVs and promote cancer invasion and metastasis. Intratumoral hypoxia is an integral component of all solid tumors. The relationship between hypoxic tumor-shed MVs and NK-mediated cytotoxicity remains unknown. In this paper, we reported that MVs derived from hypoxic tumor cells qualitatively differ from those derived from normoxic tumor cells. Using multiple tumor models, we showed that hypoxic MVs inhibit more NK cell function as compared to normoxic MVs. Hypoxic TD-MVs package two immunosuppressive factors involved in the impairment of natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity against different tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. We showed that following their uptake by NK cells, hypoxic TD-MVs transfer TGF-β1 to NK cells, decreasing the cell surface expression of the activating receptor NKG2D, thereby inhibiting NK cell function. MicroRNA profiling revealed the presence of high levels of miR-210 and miR-23a in hypoxic TD-MVs. We demonstrated that miR-23a in hypoxic TD-MVs operates as an additional immunomosuppressive factor, since it directly targets the expression of CD107a in NK cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that hypoxic tumor cells by secreting MVs can educate NK cells and decrease their antitumor immune response. This study highlights the existence of a novel mechanism of immune suppression mediated by hypoxic TD-MVs and further improves our understanding of the immunosuppressive mechanisms prevailing in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.

J Cell Mol Med	2016	Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder. Recent evidence indicates that altered crosstalk between CML and mesenchymal stromal cells may affect leukaemia survival; moreover, vesicles released by both tumour and non-tumour cells into the microenvironment provide a suitable niche for cancer cell growth and survival. We previously demonstrated that leukaemic and stromal cells establish an exosome-mediated bidirectional crosstalk leading to the production of IL8 in stromal cells, thus sustaining the survival of CML cells. Human cell lines used are LAMA84 (CML cells), HS5 (stromal cells) and bone marrow primary stromal cells; gene expression and protein analysis were performed by real-time PCR and Western blot. IL8 and MMP9 secretions were evaluated by ELISA. Exosomes were isolated from CML cells and blood samples of CML patients. Here, we show that LAMA84 and CML patients' exosomes contain amphiregulin (AREG), thus activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling in stromal cells. EGFR signalling increases the expression of SNAIL and its targets, MMP9 and IL8. We also demonstrated that pre-treatment of HS5 with LAMA84 exosomes increases the expression of annexin A2 that promotes the adhesion of leukaemic cells to the stromal monolayer, finally supporting the growth and invasiveness of leukaemic cells. Leukaemic and stromal cells establish a bidirectional crosstalk: exosomes promote proliferation and survival of leukaemic cells, both in vitro and in vivo, by inducing IL8 secretion from stromal cells. We propose that this mechanism is activated by a ligand-receptor interaction between AREG, found in CML exosomes, and EGFR in bone marrow stromal cells.	PMC4876029

Methods Mol Biol	2016	Over the last 10 years, the constant progression in exosome (Exo)-related studies highlighted the importance of these cell-derived nano-sized vesicles in cell biology and pathophysiology. Functional studies on Exo uptake and intracellular trafficking require accurate quantification to assess sufficient and/or necessary Exo particles quantum able to elicit measurable effects on target cells. We used commercially available BODIPY(®) fatty acid analogues to label a primary melanoma cell line (Me501) that highly and spontaneously secrete nanovesicles. Upon addition to cell culture, BODIPY fatty acids are rapidly incorporated into major phospholipid classes ultimately producing fluorescent Exo as direct result of biogenesis. Our metabolic labeling protocol produced bright fluorescent Exo that can be examined and quantified with conventional non-customized flow cytometry (FC) instruments by exploiting their fluorescent emission rather than light-scattering detection. Furthermore, our methodology permits the measurement of single Exo-associated fluorescence transfer to cells making quantitative the correlation between Exo uptake and activation of cellular processes. Thus the protocol presented here appears as an appropriate tool to who wants to investigate mechanisms of Exo functions in that it allows for direct and rapid characterization and quantification of fluorescent Exo number, intensity, size, and eventually evaluation of their kinetic of uptake/secretion in target cells.

Whilst the concept of vesicle secretion and uptake is broad reaching, the molecular composition of these complexes is expected to be diverse based on the physiology and environmental niche of different organisms. Exosomes are one class of EVs originally defined based on their endocytic origin, as these derive from multivesicular bodies that then fuse with the plasma membrane releasing them into the extracellular environment. The term exosome has also been used to describe any small EVs recovered by high-speed ultracentrifugation, irrespective of origin since this is not always well characterized. Here, we use comparative global lipidomic analysis to examine the composition of EVs, which we term exosomes, that are secreted by the gastrointestinal nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, in relation to exosomes secreted by cells of its murine host. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis reveals a 9- to 62-fold enrichment of plasmalogens, as well as other classes of ether glycerophospholipids, along with a relative lack of cholesterol and sphingomyelin (SM) in the nematode exosomes compared with those secreted by murine cells. Biophysical analyses of the membrane dynamics of these exosomes demonstrate increased rigidity in those from the nematode, and parallel studies with synthetic vesicles support a role of plasmalogens in stabilizing the membrane structure. These results suggest that nematodes can maintain exosome membrane structure and integrity through increased plasmalogens, compensating for diminished levels of other lipids, including cholesterol and SM. This work also illuminates the prevalence of plasmalogens in some EVs, which has not been widely reported and could have implications for the biochemical or immunomodulatory properties of EVs. Further comparative analyses such as those described here will shed light on diversity in the molecular properties of EVs that enable them to function in cross-species communication.	PMC4937767

Biotechnol Lett	2016	OBJECTIVES: To examine the potential of exosomes derived from the tumor cells, which had been genetically modified to express a Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen, as a cancer vaccine aimed at overcoming the weak immunogenicity of tumor antigens. RESULTS: We transfected B16 melanoma cells with a plasmid encoding the M. tuberculosis antigen, early secretory antigenic target-6 (ESAT-6). The secreted exosomes bearing both tumor-associated antigens and the pathogenic antigen (or their epitopes) were collected. When the exosomes were injected into foot pads of mice, they significantly (p < 0.05) evoked cellular immunity against both ESAT-6, and B16 tumor cells. Intra-tumoral injection of the exosomes significantly suppressed (p < 0.001) tumor growth in syngeneic B16 tumor-bearing mice, while the exosomes derived from the non-transfected B16 cells showed no effect on tumor growth, although both exosomes should have similar tumor antigens. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes bearing both tumor antigens and the M. tuberculosis antigen (or their epitopes) have a high potential as a candidate for cancer vaccine to overcome the immune escape by tumor cells.

Concomitant Evaluation of a Panel of Exosome Proteins and MiRs for Qualification of Cultured Human Corneal Endothelial Cells.	Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci	2016	PURPOSE: We elucidate a method to use secreted miRNA profiles to qualify cultured human corneal endothelial cells (cHCECs) adaptable for cell-injection therapy. METHODS: The variations of cHCECs in their composites of heterogeneous subpopulations (SPs) were verified in relation to their surface cluster-of-differentiation (CD) markers. Integrated analysis of micro RNA (miRNA) profiles in culture supernatants (CS) were investigated by 3D-Gene Human microRNA Chips. To validate 3D-Gene results, quantitative real-time PCR was done from numerous cultures with distinct morphology and SP composition. Exosomes and miRNAs in CS also were analyzed. RESULTS: Secreted miRNA profiles among morphologically-diverse cHCEC SPs proved useful for individual distinction. Candidate miRNAs to discriminate CD44- SPs from those with CD44++ ∼ CD44+++ phenotypes were miRs 221-3p, 1246, 1915-3p, and 4732-5p. The levels of the latter-three miRs decreased dramatically in cHCEC CS without cell-state transition (CST) compared to those of control medium, whereas those from cHCECs with senescence-like CST showed an increase. MicroR184 decreased inversely in parallel with the upregulation of CD44 on cHCECs. CD9+ exosomes were more elevated in cHCEC CS with senescence-like CST than those without CST, indicating the possible import of these extracellular vesicles (EVs) into cHCECs without CST. CONCLUSIONS: Cultured HCECs sharing a CD44- phenotype of matured HCECs may be discriminated by measuring the amount of miRNAs or exosome in CS. Thus, miRNA in CS may serve as a tool to qualify cHCECs. Future detailed analysis of cell-to-cell communication via these EVs might open novel pathways for a better understanding of CST in HCEC cultures.

Increased Brain-Specific MiR-9 and MiR-124 in the Serum Exosomes of Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients.	PLoS One	2016	The aims of this study were to examine the alternation in serum exosome concentrations and the levels of serum exosomal miR-9 and miR-124, two brain-specific miRNAs, in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients and to explore the predictive values of these miRNAs for AIS diagnosis and damage evaluation. Sixty-five patients with AIS at the acute stage were enrolled and 66 non-stroke volunteers served as controls. Serum exosomes isolated by ExoQuick precipitations were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle-tracking analysis and western blotting. The levels of exosomal miR-9 and miR-124 were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Compared with controls, the concentration of serum exosomes and the median levels of serum exosomal miR-9 and miR-124 were significantly higher in AIS patients (p<0.01). The levels of both miR-9 and miR-124 were positively correlated with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, infarct volumes and serum concentrations of IL-6. The areas under the curve for exosomal miR-9 and miR-124 were 0.8026 and 0.6976, respectively. This proof of concept study suggests that serum exosomal miR-9 and miR-124 are promising biomarkers for diagnosing AIS and evaluating the degree of damage caused by ischemic injury. However, further studies are needed to explore the potential roles of the exosomes released from brain tissues in post stroke complications.	PMC5035015

Electronic address: .	marzia.delre@gmail.com		The Detection of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Plasma-derived Exosomal RNA Strongly Predicts Resistance to Hormonal Therapy in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients.	Eur Urol	2017	BACKGROUND: The androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) is associated with resistance to hormonal therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Due to limitations of the methods available for AR-V7 analysis, the identification of a reliable detection method may facilitate the use of this biomarker in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To confirm AR-V7 as a predictor of resistance to hormonal therapy and develop a new approach to assess AR-V7 by highly sensitive digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) in plasma-derived exosomal RNA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Plasma samples were collected from 36 CRPC patients before they began second-line hormonal treatment. Exosomes were isolated and RNA extracted for analysis of AR-V7 by ddPCR. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The absolute target gene concentration as copies per milliliter (copies/ml) was determined by ddPCR. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 26 patients received abiraterone and 10 enzalutamide; 39% of patients were found to be AR-V7 positive (AR-V7+). Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in AR-V7 negative (AR-V7-) versus AR-V7+ patients (20 vs 3 mo; p<0.001). Overall survival was significantly shorter in AR-V7+ participants at baseline compared with AR-V7- participants (8 mo vs not reached; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that plasma-derived exosomal RNA is a reliable source of AR-V7 that can be detected sensitively by ddPCR assay. We also showed that resistance to hormonal therapy may be predicted by AR-V7, making it a clinically relevant biomarker. PATIENT SUMMARY: We report a first study on a method for androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) detection in RNA extracted from cancer cell vesicles released in blood. Results confirmed the role of AR-V7 as a predictive biomarker of resistance to hormonal therapy. Our assay showed that vesicles are a reliable source of AR-V7 RNA and that the method is fast, highly sensitive, and affordable.

Myoferlin is a novel exosomal protein and functional regulator of cancer-derived exosomes.	Oncotarget	2016	Exosomes are communication mediators participating in the intercellular exchange of proteins, metabolites and nucleic acids. Recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes are characterized by a unique proteomic composition that is distinct from the cellular one. The mechanisms responsible for determining the proteome content of the exosomes remain however obscure. In the current study we employ ultrastructural approach to validate a novel exosomal protein myoferlin. This is a multiple C2-domain containing protein, known for its conserved physiological function in endocytosis and vesicle fusion biology. Emerging studies demonstrate that myoferlin is frequently overexpressed in cancer, where it promotes cancer cell migration and invasion. Our data expand these findings by showing that myoferlin is a general component of cancer cell derived exosomes from different breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Using proteomic analysis, we demonstrate for the first time that myoferlin depletion in cancer cells leads to a significantly modulated exosomal protein load. Such myoferlin-depleted exosomes were also functionally deficient as shown by their reduced capacity to transfer nucleic acids to human endothelial cells (HUVEC). Beyond this, myoferlin-depleted cancer exosomes also had a significantly reduced ability to induce migration and proliferation of HUVEC. The present study highlights myoferlin as a new functional player in exosome biology, calling for novel strategies to target this emerging oncogene in human cancer.	PMC5347796

Exosomal microRNA miR-1246 induces cell motility and invasion through the regulation of DENND2D in oral squamous cell carcinoma.	Sci Rep	2016	Metastasis is associated with poor prognosis in cancers. Exosomes, which are packed with RNA and proteins and are released in all biological fluids, are emerging as an important mediator of intercellular communication. However, the function of exosomes remains poorly understood in cancer metastasis. Here, we demonstrate that exosomes isolated by size-exclusion chromatography from a highly metastatic human oral cancer cell line, HOC313-LM, induced cell growth through the activation of ERK and AKT as well as promoted cell motility of the poorly metastatic cancer cell line HOC313-P. MicroRNA (miRNA) array analysis identified two oncogenic miRNAs, miR-342-3p and miR-1246, that were highly expressed in exosomes. These miRNAs were transferred to poorly metastatic cells by exosomes, which resulted in increased cell motility and invasive ability. Moreover, miR-1246 increased cell motility by directly targeting DENN/MADD Domain Containing 2D (DENND2D). Taken together, our findings support the metastatic role of exosomes and exosomal miRNAs, which highlights their potential for applications in miRNA-based therapeutics.	PMC5144099

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to transport miRNA, mRNA and protein, suggesting that they are new communication mediators. Diffusible mesenchymal factors determine the fate of Műllerian epithelial cells into oviductal ciliated cells. In the present study, we investigated whether EVs mediate the communication in the epithelial-mesenchymal interaction during oviductal ciliogenesis. EVs were isolated from cells of oviductal mesenchymal cell line (S1 cells) and characterized by TEM and expression of exosomal marker CD81. CD81 protein was also detected in oviductal mesenchyme, suggesting that CD81-expressing exosomes may be secreted from oviductal mesenchyme, as well as S1 cells. β-actin, Gapdh and Vimentin mRNAs and miRNAs were detected in the exosomes. mRNA in S1 cells was able to be transported into cells of Műllerian epithelial cell line (E1 cells) via the exosomes. The effects of exosomes derived from S1 cells on ciliogenesis of E1 cells were analyzed by in vitro models. Culture with exosomes increased the number of ciliated cells in E1 cells. These results suggest that exosomes derived from mesenchymal cells modulate the oviductal ciliogenesis and open new avenues for developmental study of EVs.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2017	Maternal microchimerism (MMc) has been associated with development of allospecific transplant tolerance, antitumor immunity, and cross-generational reproductive fitness, but its mode of action is unknown. We found in a murine model that MMc caused exposure to the noninherited maternal antigens in all offspring, but in some, MMc magnitude was enough to cause membrane alloantigen acquisition (mAAQ; "cross-dressing") of host dendritic cells (DCs). Extracellular vesicle (EV)-enriched serum fractions from mAAQ+, but not from non-mAAQ, mice reproduced the DC cross-dressing phenomenon in vitro. In vivo, mAAQ was associated with increased expression of immune modulators PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) and CD86 by myeloid DCs (mDCs) and decreased presentation of allopeptide+self-MHC complexes, along with increased PD-L1, on plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Remarkably, both serum EV-enriched fractions and membrane microdomains containing the acquired MHC alloantigens included CD86, but completely excluded PD-L1. In contrast, EV-enriched fractions and microdomains containing allopeptide+self-MHC did not exclude PD-L1. Adoptive transfer of allospecific transgenic CD4 T cells revealed a "split tolerance" status in mAAQ+ mice: T cells recognizing intact acquired MHC alloantigens proliferated, whereas those responding to allopeptide+self-MHC did not. Using isolated pDCs and mDCs for in vitro culture with allopeptide+self-MHC-specific CD4 T cells, we could replicate their normal activation in non-mAAQ mice, and PD-L1-dependent anergy in mAAQ+ hosts. We propose that EVs provide a physiologic link between microchimerism and split tolerance, with implications for tumor immunity, transplantation, autoimmunity, and reproductive success.	PMC5293109

Potential role of corneal epithelial cell-derived exosomes in corneal wound healing and neovascularization.	Sci Rep	2017	Specific factors from the corneal epithelium underlying the stimulation of stromal fibrosis and myofibroblast formation in corneal wound healing have not been fully elucidated. Given that exosomes are known to transfer bioactive molecules among cells and play crucial roles in wound healing, angiogenesis, and cancer, we hypothesized that corneal epithelial cell-derived exosomes may gain access to the underlying stromal fibroblasts upon disruption of the epithelial basement membrane and that they induce signaling events essential for corneal wound healing. In the present study, exosome-like vesicles were observed between corneal epithelial cells and the stroma during wound healing after corneal epithelial debridement. These vesicles were also found in the stroma following anterior stromal keratectomy, in which surgical removal of the epithelium, basement membrane, and anterior stroma was performed. Exosomes secreted by mouse corneal epithelial cells were found to fuse to keratocytes in vitro and to induce myofibroblast transformation. In addition, epithelial cell-derived exosomes induced endothelial cell proliferation and ex vivo aortic ring sprouting. Our results indicate that epithelial cell-derived exosomes mediate communication between corneal epithelial cells and corneal keratocytes as well as vascular endothelial cells. These findings demonstrate that epithelial-derived exosomes may be involved in corneal wound healing and neovascularization, and thus, may serve as targets for potential therapeutic interventions.

Exosomes Secreted from Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Prevent Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head by Promoting Angiogenesis.	Int J Biol Sci	2017	Background: Local ischemia is the main pathological performance in osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). There is currently no effective therapy to promote angiogenesis in the femoral head. Recent studies revealed that exosomes secreted by induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iPS-MSC-Exos) have great therapeutic potential in ischemic tissues, but whether they could promote angiogenesis in ONFH has not been reported, and little is known regarding the underlying mechanism. Methods: iPS-MSC-Exos were intravenously injected to a steroid-induced rat osteonecrosis model. Samples of the femoral head were obtained 3 weeks after all the injections. The effects were assessed by measuring local angiogenesis and bone loss through histological and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, micro-CT and three-dimensional microangiography. The effects of exosomes on endothelial cells were studied through evaluations of proliferation, migration and tube-forming analyses. The expression levels of angiogenic related PI3K/Akt signaling pathway of endothelial cells were evaluated following stimulation of iPS-MSC-Exos. The promoting effects of exosomes were re-evaluated following blockade of PI3K/Akt. Results: The in vivo study revealed that administration of iPS-MSC-Exos significantly prevented bone loss, and increased microvessel density in the femoral head compared with control group. We found that iPS-MSC-Exos significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration and tube-forming capacities of endothelial cells in vitro. iPS-MSC-Exos could activate PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Moreover, the promoting effects of iPS-MSC-Exos were abolished after blockade of PI3K/Akt on endothelial cells. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that transplantation of iPS-MSC-Exos exerts a preventative effect on ONFH by promoting local angiogenesis and preventing bone loss. The promoting effect might be attributed to activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway on endothelial cells. The data provide the first evidence for the potential of iPS-MSC-Exos in treating ONFH.

Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci	2017	OBJECTIVE: Angiogenesis is a key event in the progression of gliomas, and emerging evidence suggests that exosomes are signaling extracellular organelles that modulate the tumor microenvironment and promote angiogenesis and tumor progression. This study aimed to explore the mechanism by which glioma-derived exosomes affect angiogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression level of linc-POU3F3 in glioma tissue as well as glioma cell lines. Ultrafiltration combined with a purification method was used to isolate exosomes derived from A172 cells (A172-Exo) and linc-POU3F3 shRNA-treated A172 cells (shA172-Exo). Transmission electron microscopy, Western blot and tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) were used to identify exosomes. In vitro migration, proliferation, and tube formation experiments, as well as in vivo CAM assays, were used to analyze the pro-angiogenesis ability of exosomes. qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to identify expression levels of angiogenesis-related genes and proteins in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) after being cultured with exosomes. RESULTS: The levels of linc-POU3F3 were upregulated in glioma tissue and significantly correlated with the advanced tumor stage. A172 cells exhibited the highest expression level. A172-Exo was similar to shA172-Exo (50-100 nm in diameter) and expressed Alix, Tsg101 and CD9, while the expression level of linc-POU3F3 in A172-Exo was significantly higher than that in shA172-Exo. HBMECs rapidly internalized A172-Exo and shA172-Exo, and the linc-POU3F3 expression level in HBMECs treated with A172-Exo was significantly higher than the level in HBMECs treated with shA172-Exo. A172-Exo exhibited better function in promoting HBMECs migration, proliferation, tubular-like structure formation in vitro and arteriole formation in vivo. The gene and protein expression level of bFGF, bFGFR, VEGFA, and Angio in HBMECs treated with A172-Exo was much higher than that of HBMECs treated with shA172-Exo. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that gliomas can induce angiogenesis by secreting exosomes enriched in linc-POU3F3. Exosomes and lncRNA-POU3F3 may, therefore, function as a putative therapeutic target in glioma.

J Hepatol	2017	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and receiving long-term treatment with nucleoside or nucleotide analogues are at risk of selecting HBV strains with complex mutational patterns. We herein report two cases of HBV-infected patients with insufficient viral suppression, despite dual antiviral therapy with entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir (TDF). One patient died from aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Serum samples from the two patients at different time points were analyzed using ultra-deep pyrosequencing analysis. HBV mutations were identified and transiently transfected into hepatoma cells in vitro using replication-competent HBV vectors, and functionally analyzed. We assessed replication efficacy, resistance to antivirals and potential impact on HBV secretion (viral particles, exosomes). RESULTS: Sequencing analyses revealed the selection of the rtS78T HBV polymerase mutation in both cases that simultaneously creates a premature stop codon at sC69 and thereby deletes almost the entire small HBV surface protein. One of the patients had an additional 261bp deletion in the preS1/S2 region. Functional analyses of the mutations in vitro revealed that the rtS78T/sC69∗ mutation, but not the preS1/S2 deletion, significantly enhanced viral replication and conferred reduced susceptibility to ETV and TDF. The sC69∗ mutation caused truncation of HBs protein, leading to impaired detection by commercial HBsAg assay, without causing intracellular HBsAg retention or affecting HBV secretion. CONCLUSIONS: The rtS78T/sC69∗ HBV mutation, associated with enhanced replication and insufficient response to antiviral treatment, may favor long-term persistence of these isolates. In addition to the increased production of HBV transcripts and the sustained secretion of viral particles in the absence of antigenic domains of S protein, this HBV mutation may predispose patients to carcinogenic effects. LAY SUMMARY: Long-term treatment with antiviral drugs carries the risk of selecting mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV). We herein report two cases of patients with insufficient response to dual tenofovir and entecavir therapy. Molecular analyses identified a distinct mutation, rtS78T/sC69∗, that abolishes HBsAg detection, enhances replication, sustains exosome-mediated virion secretion and decreases susceptibility to antivirals, thereby representing a potentially high-risk mutation for HBV-infected individuals.

Electronic address: .	akanthas@iastate.edu		Environmental neurotoxicant manganese regulates exosome-mediated extracellular miRNAs in cell culture model of Parkinson's disease: Relevance to α-synuclein misfolding in metal neurotoxicity.	Neurotoxicology	2018	Many chronic neurodegenerative disorders share a common pathogenic mechanism involving the aggregation and deposition of misfolded proteins. Recently, it was shown that these aggregated proteins could be transferred from one cell to another via extracellular nanovesicles called exosomes. Initially thought to be a means of cellular waste removal, exosomes have since been discovered to actively participate in cell-to-cell communication. Importantly, various inflammatory and signaling molecules, as well as small RNAs are selectively packaged in these vesicles. Considering the important role of environmental manganese (Mn) in Parkinson's disease (PD)-like neurological disorders, we characterized the effect of Mn on exosome content and release using an MN9D dopaminergic cell model of PD, which was generated to stably express wild-type human α-synuclein (αSyn). Mn exposure (300μM MnCl2) for 24h induced the release of exosomes into the extracellular media prior to cytotoxicity, as determined by NanoSight particle analysis and electron microscopy. Strikingly, Western blot analysis revealed that Mn treatment in αSyn-expressing cells increases the protein Rab27a, which regulates the release of exosomes from cells. Moreover, next-generation sequencing showed more small RNAs in exosomes isolated from Mn-exposed cells than from control exosomes. Our miRNA profiling analysis led to the discovery of increased expression of certain miRNAs previously shown to regulate key biological pathways, including protein aggregation, autophagy, inflammation and hypoxia. Collectively, our results provide a glimpse of Mn's role in modulating extracellular miRNA content through exosomal release from dopaminergic neuronal cells and thus potentially contributing to progressive neurodegeneration. Further characterization of extracellular miRNAs and their targets will have major impacts on biomarker discovery and translational strategies for environmentally linked neurodegenerative diseases including PD.

Biochim Biophys Acta	2017	Neuroblastoma is the third most common childhood cancer, and timely diagnosis and sensitive therapeutic monitoring remain major challenges. Tumor progression and recurrence is common with little understanding of mechanisms. A major recent focus in cancer biology is the impact of exosomes on metastatic behavior and the tumor microenvironment. Exosomes have been demonstrated to contribute to the oncogenic effect on the surrounding tumor environment and also mediate resistance to therapy. The effect of genotype on exosomal phenotype has not yet been explored. We interrogated exosomes from human neuroblastoma cells that express wild-type or mutant forms of the HFE gene. HFE, one of the most common autosomal recessive polymorphisms in the Caucasian population, originally associated with hemochromatosis, has also been associated with increased tumor burden, therapeutic resistance boost, and negative impact on patient survival. Herein, we demonstrate that changes in genotype cause major differences in the molecular and functional properties of exosomes; specifically, HFE mutant derived exosomes have increased expression of proteins relating to invasion, angiogenesis, and cancer therapeutic resistance. HFE mutant derived exosomes were also shown to transfer this cargo to recipient cells and cause an increased oncogenic functionality in those recipient cells.

Hypertension	2017	Preeclampsia, a multisystem hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, is associated with increased systemic vascular resistance. Placentae from patients with preeclampsia have reduced levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and, thus, less nitric oxide (NO). Syncytiotrophoblast extracellular vesicles (STBEV), comprising microvesicles (STBMV) and exosomes, carry signals from the syncytiotrophoblast to the mother. We hypothesized that STBEV-bound eNOS (STBEV-eNOS), capable of producing NO, are released into the maternal circulation. Dual-lobe ex vivo placental perfusion and differential centrifugation was used to isolate STBEV from preeclampsia (n=8) and normal pregnancies (NP; n=11). Plasma samples of gestational age-matched preeclampsia and NP (n=6) were used to isolate circulating STBMV. STBEV expressed placental alkaline phosphatase, confirming placental origin. STBEV coexpressed eNOS, but not inducible nitric oxide synthase, confirmed using Western blot, flow cytometry, and immunodepletion. STBEV-eNOS produced NO, which was significantly inhibited by N G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (eNOS inhibitor; P<0.05) but not by N-(3-(aminomethyl) bezyl) acetamidine) (inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor). STBEV-eNOS catalytic activity was confirmed by visualizing eNOS dimerization. STBEV-eNOS was more abundant in uterine vein compared with peripheral blood, indicating placental origin. STBEV isolated from preeclampsia-perfused placentae had lower levels of STBEV-eNOS (STBMV; P<0.05) and overall lower NO activity (STBMV, not significant; syncytiotrophoblast extracellular exosomes, P<0.05) compared with those from NP. Circulating plasma STBMV from preeclampsia women had lower STBEV-eNOS expression compared with that from NP women (P<0.01). This is the first observation of functional eNOS expressed on STBEV from NP and preeclampsia placentae, as well as in plasma. The lower STBEV-eNOS NO production seen in preeclampsia may contribute to the decreased NO bioavailability in this disease.	PMC5507817

Exosomes from Plasmodium-infected hosts inhibit tumor angiogenesis in a murine Lewis lung cancer model.	Oncogenesis	2017	Previous research to investigate the interaction between malaria infection and tumor progression has revealed that malaria infection can potentiate host immune response against tumor in tumor-bearing mice. Exosomes may play key roles in disseminating pathogenic host-derived molecules during infection because several studies have shown the involvement and roles of extracellular vesicles in cell-cell communication. However, the role of exosomes generated during Plasmodium infection in tumor growth, progression and angiogenesis has not been studied either in animals or in the clinics. To test this hypothesis, we designed an animal model to generate and isolate exosomes from mice which were subsequently used to treat the tumor. Intra-tumor injection of exosomes derived from the plasma of Plasmodium-infected mice provided significantly reduced Lewis lung cancer growth in mice. We further co-cultured the isolated exosomes with endothelial cells and observed significantly reduced expression of VEGFR2 and migration in the endothelial cells. Interestingly, high level of micro-RNA (miRNA) 16/322/497/17 was detected in the exosomes derived from the plasma of mice infected with Plasmodium compared with those from control mice. We observed that overexpression of the miRNA 16/322/497/17 in endothelial cell corresponded with decreased expression of VEGFR2, inhibition of angiogenesis and inhibition of the miRNA 16/322/497/17 significantly alleviated these effects. These data provide novel scientific evidence of the interaction between Plasmodium infection and lung cancer growth and angiogenesis.	PMC5519199

Electronic address: .	skumarvb@cukerala.ac.in		Horizontal transfer of miR-106a/b from cisplatin resistant hepatocarcinoma cells can alter the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin.	Cell Signal	2017	Recent studies indicate that horizontal transfer of genetic material can act as a communication tool between heterogenous populations of tumour cells, thus altering the chemosensitivity of tumour cells. The present study was designed to check whether the horizontal transfer of miRNAs released by cisplatin resistant (Cp-r) Hepatocarcinoma cells can alter the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells. For this exosomes secreted by cisplatin resistant and cisplatin sensitive HepG2 cells (EXres and EXsen) were isolated and characterised. Cytotoxicity analysis showed that EXres can make Hela cells resistant to cisplatin. Analysis of miR-106a/b levels in EXres and EXsen showed that their levels vary. Mechanistic studies showed that miR-106a/b play an important role in EXsen and EXres mediated change in chemosensitivity of Hela cells to cisplatin. Further SIRT1 was identified as a major target of miR-106a/b using in silico tools and this was proved by experimentation. Also the effect of miR-106a/b in chemosensitivity was seen to be dependent on regulation of SIRT1 by miR-106a/b. In brief, this study brings into light, the SIRT1 dependent mechanism of miR-106a/b mediated regulation of chemosensitivity upon the horizontal transfer from one cell type to another.

Cell Biochem Funct	2017	Ovarian cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Owing to late syndromic presentation and lack of efficient early detection, most cases are diagnosed at advanced stages. Surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy are still the standard care currently. However, resistance invoked often compromises the clinical value of the latter. Expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was analysed by gene array. Protein was determined by immunoblotting. Exosome was isolated with commercial kit. Cell proliferation was measured by CCK8 method. Annexin V-PI double staining was performed for apoptosis evaluation. Xenograft model was established and administrated with exosome. Tumour growth and overall survival were monitored. We demonstrated the upregulation of DNMT1 in both tumour and derived cell line. DNMT1 transcripts were highly enriched in exosomes from conditioned medium of ovarian cells. Co-incubation with exosomes stimulated endogenous expression and rendered host cell the resistance to cytotoxicity of cisplatin. In vivo administration of DNMT1-containing exosomes exacerbated xenograft progression and reduced overall survival significantly. Moreover, treatment with exosome inhibitor GW4869 almost completely restored sensitivity in resistant cells. Our data elucidated an unappreciated mechanism of exosomal DNMT1 in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer, also indicating the potential of the combination of exosome inhibitor with cisplatin in resistant patients.

Herpesviruses shape tumour microenvironment through exosomal transfer of viral microRNAs.	PLoS Pathog	2017	Metabolic changes within the cell and its niche affect cell fate and are involved in many diseases and disorders including cancer and viral infections. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). KSHV latently infected cells express only a subset of viral genes, mainly located within the latency-associated region, among them 12 microRNAs. Notably, these miRNAs are responsible for inducing the Warburg effect in infected cells. Here we identify a novel mechanism enabling KSHV to manipulate the metabolic nature of the tumour microenvironment. We demonstrate that KSHV infected cells specifically transfer the virus-encoded microRNAs to surrounding cells via exosomes. This flow of genetic information results in a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis in the surrounding non-infected cells. Importantly, this exosome-mediated metabolic reprogramming of neighbouring cells supports the growth of infected cells, thereby contributing to viral fitness. Finally, our data show that this miRNA transfer-based regulation of cell metabolism is a general mechanism used by other herpesviruses, such as EBV, as well as for the transfer of non-viral onco-miRs. This exosome-based crosstalk provides viruses with a mechanism for non-infectious transfer of genetic material without production of new viral particles, which might expose them to the immune system. We suggest that viruses and cancer cells use this mechanism to shape a specific metabolic niche that will contribute to their fitness.	PMC5570218

Exosomes secreted from mutant-HIF-1α-modified bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells attenuate early steroid-induced avascular necrosis of femoral head in rabbit.	Cell Biol Int	2017	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes exhibit protective effects on damaged or diseased tissues. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) plays a critical role in bone development. However, HIF-1α is easily biodegradable under normoxic conditions. The bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were transfected with adenovirus carrying triple point-mutations (amino acids 402, 564, and 803) in the HIF-1α coding sequence (CDS). The mutant HIF-1α can efficiently express functional proteins under normoxic conditions. To date, no study has reported the role of exosomes secreted by mutant HIF-1α modified BMSCs in the recovery of the early steroid-induced avascular necrosis of femoral head (SANFH). In this study, we firstly analyzed exosomes derived from BMSCs modified by mutant (BMSC-ExosMU ) or wild-type HIF-1α (BMSC-ExosWT ). In vitro, we investigated the osteogenic differentiation capacity of BMSCs modified by BMSC-ExosMU or BMSC-ExosWT , and the angiogenesis effects of BMSC-ExosMU and BMSC-ExosWT on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Besides, the healing of the femoral head was also assessed in vivo. We found that the potential of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs treated with BMSC-ExosMU was higher than the wild-type group in vitro. In addition, BMSC-ExosMU stimulated the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the BMSC-ExosWT or PBS control group, the injection of BMSC-ExosMU into the necrosis region markedly accelerated the bone regeneration and angiogenesis, which were indicated by the increased trabecular reconstruction and microvascular density. Taken together, our data suggest that BMSC-ExosMU facilitates the repair of SANFH by enhancing osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

Exosomes from Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hiPSC-MSCs) Protect Liver against Hepatic Ischemia/ Reperfusion Injury via Activating Sphingosine Kinase and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Signaling Pathway.	Cell Physiol Biochem	2017	BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of exosomes produced by human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hiPSC-MSCs-Exo) on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, as well as the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Exosomes derived from hiPSC-MSCs were isolated and characterized both biochemically and biophysically. hiPSC-MSCs-Exo were injected systemically into a murine ischemia/reperfusion injury model via the inferior vena cava, and then the therapeutic effects were evaluated. The serum levels of transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), as well as histological changes were examined. Primary hepatocytes and human hepatocyte cell line HL7702 were used to test whether exosomes could induce hepatocytes proliferation in vitro. In addition, the expression levels of proliferation markers (proliferation cell nuclear antigen, PCNA; Phosphohistone-H3, PHH3) were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Moreover, SK inhibitor (SKI-II) and S1P1 receptor antagonist (VPC23019) were used to investigate the role of sphingosine kinase and sphingosine-1-phosphate-dependent pathway in the effects of hiPSC-MSCs-Exo on hepatocytes. RESULTS: hiPSCs were efficiently induced into hiPSC-MSCs that had typical MSC characteristics. hiPSC-MSCs-Exo had diameters ranging from 100 to 200 nm and expressed exosome markers (Alix, CD63 and CD81). After hiPSC-MSCs-Exo administration, hepatocyte necrosis and sinusoidal congestion were markedly suppressed in the ischemia/reperfusion injury model, with lower histopathological scores. The levels of hepatocyte injury markers AST and ALT were significantly lower in the treatment group compared to control, and the expression levels of proliferation markers (PCNA and PHH3) were greatly induced after hiPSC-MSCs-Exo administration. Moreover, hiPSC-MSCs-Exo also induced primary hepatocytes and HL7702 cells proliferation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. We found that hiPSC-MSCs-Exo could directly fuse with target hepatocytes or HL7702 cells and increase the activity of sphingosine kinase and synthesis of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Furthermore, the inhibition of SK1 or S1P1 receptor completely abolished the protective and proliferative effects of hiPSC-MSCs-Exo on hepatocytes, both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that hiPSC-MSCs-Exo could alleviate hepatic I/R injury via activating sphingosine kinase and sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway in hepatocytes and promote cell proliferation. These findings represent a novel mechanism that potentially contributes to liver regeneration and have important implications for new therapeutic approaches to acute liver disease.

Hot News: Exosomes as New Players in HIV Pathogenesis - New Data from the IAS 2017.	AIDS Rev	2017 Oct-Dec	Exosomes are nanovesicles that can be released into the extracellular medium by different cell types and are considered an important system of intercellular communication. In some instances, on secretion, exosomes break down and release their content into the extracellular space. Alternatively, intact exosomes can interact with other cells and discharge their content directly into the target cell cytoplasm. Exosomes are rich in endosome-associated proteins (i.e., the tetraspanin family) but also carry different molecules in their lumen including proteins, RNAs (i.e., microRNAs), and pathogenderived cargo. Indeed, the different biological functions of exosomes might depend on their cargo components. Several recent publications have identified exosomes as new players in the pathogenesis of HIV infection. This is an emerging field of growing interest that deserved a satellite symposium at the 9th IAS Conference held in Paris in July 2017, sponsored by the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (EVs). Although the role of exosomes in HIV infection is not yet clarified, accumulating data suggest that exosomes may act at different levels of HIV pathogenesis by modulating immune responses, infectivity, or even by activating the latent viral reservoir. However, there are still methodological limitations that need to be resolved to advance our understanding of the role of exosomes in HIV infection. One particular limitation is to define an accurate and reproducible procedure for their isolation. A new strategy to separate exosomes from HIV-1-infected cells was proposed at this symposium. Martin-Jaular and colleagues (Institut Curie, France) used velocity centrifugation gradients and antibody labeling of specific endosome-associated protein markers (i.e., CD45+ and AChE+) to isolate pure exosomes from complex preparations of EVs. Separately, Arakelyan and colleagues (NIH, USA) used flow cytometry coupled with magnetic nanoparticles to characterize the antigenic composition of EVs and demonstrate that EVs carrying HIV envelope proteins facilitated HIV infection. This is an interesting observation that could lead to the discovery of new antiviral drugs targeting EVs that contain HIV-Env. Exosomes might also have an effect on the viral reservoir. Kashanchi et al. (George Mason University, USA) presented interesting results demonstrating how exosomes from HIV-uninfected cells could reactivate latent HIV-1 in infected cells. They proposed a mechanism in which exosomes might increase RNA polymerase II loading onto the HIV-1 promoter in the infected cells, thereby facilitating transcription and leading to an increase of cellular activation. These presentations represent just a small piece of the growing body of research focused on the role of exosomes in HIV infection. We stand at the beginning of a new source of knowledge of HIV pathogenesis that may provide novel strategies to control HIV infectivity, regulate HIV-reactive immune responses, and act against the HIV reservoir. The impact of exosomes on HIV infection at all these levels should be considered in ongoing and future approaches to achieve HIV remission and cure.	PMC5828156

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2017	RNA is secreted from cells enclosed within extracellular vesicles (EVs). Defining the RNA composition of EVs is challenging due to their coisolation with contaminants, lack of knowledge of the mechanisms of RNA sorting into EVs, and limitations of conventional RNA-sequencing methods. Here we present our observations using thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase sequencing (TGIRT-seq) to characterize the RNA extracted from HEK293T cell EVs isolated by flotation gradient ultracentrifugation and from exosomes containing the tetraspanin CD63 further purified from the gradient fractions by immunoisolation. We found that EV-associated transcripts are dominated by full-length, mature transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and other small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) encapsulated within vesicles. A substantial proportion of the reads mapping to protein-coding genes, long ncRNAs, and antisense RNAs were due to DNA contamination on the surface of vesicles. Nevertheless, sequences mapping to spliced mRNAs were identified within HEK293T cell EVs and exosomes, among the most abundant being transcripts containing a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (5' TOP) motif. Our results indicate that the RNA-binding protein YBX1, which is required for the sorting of selected miRNAs into exosomes, plays a role in the sorting of highly abundant small ncRNA species, including tRNAs, Y RNAs, and Vault RNAs. Finally, we obtained evidence for an EV-specific tRNA modification, perhaps indicating a role for posttranscriptional modification in the sorting of some RNA species into EVs. Our results suggest that EVs and exosomes could play a role in the purging and intercellular transfer of excess free RNAs, including full-length tRNAs and other small ncRNAs.	PMC5663387

J Biol Chem	2018	Exosomes play a critical role in cell-to-cell communication by delivering cargo molecules to recipient cells. However, the mechanism underlying the generation of the exosomal multivesicular endosome (MVE) is one of the mysteries in the field of endosome research. Although sphingolipid metabolites such as ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are known to play important roles in MVE formation and maturation, the detailed molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we show that Rho family GTPases, including Cdc42 and Rac1, are constitutively activated on exosomal MVEs and are regulated by S1P signaling as measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based conformational changes. Moreover, we detected S1P signaling-induced filamentous actin (F-actin) formation. A selective inhibitor of Gβγ subunits, M119, strongly inhibited both F-actin formation on MVEs and cargo sorting into exosomal intralumenal vesicles of MVEs, both of which were fully rescued by the simultaneous expression of constitutively active Cdc42 and Rac1. Our results shed light on the mechanism underlying exosomal MVE maturation and inform the understanding of the physiological relevance of continuous activation of the S1P receptor and subsequent downstream G protein signaling to Gβγ subunits/Rho family GTPases-regulated F-actin formation on MVEs for cargo sorting into exosomal intralumenal vesicles.

J Virol	2018	Exosomes are small membrane-enclosed vesicles produced by various cells and actively released into the extracellular space. They participate in intercellular communication and transfer of biologically active proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Accumulating evidence suggests that exosomes derived from cells infected by some viruses selectively encapsulate viral proteins, genetic materials, or even virions to mediate cell-to-cell communication and/or virus transmission. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an Arterivirus that has been devastating the global swine industry since the late 1980s. Recent studies have shown that major proteins secreted from PRRSV-infected cells are exosomal proteins and that the serum-derived exosomes from PRRSV-infected pigs contain viral proteins. However, the role of exosomes in PRRSV infection remains unclear. In this study, purified exosomes isolated from PRRSV-infected cells were shown with reverse transcription-PCR and mass spectrometry to contain viral genomic RNA and partial viral proteins. Furthermore, exosomes from PRRSV-infected cells established productive infection in both PRRSV-susceptible and -nonsusceptible cells. More importantly, exosome-mediated infection was not completely blocked by PRRSV-specific neutralizing antibodies. In summary, this study demonstrated that exosomes can mediate PRRSV transmission and are even resistant to antibody neutralization, identifying a potential immune evasion mechanism utilized by PRRSV.IMPORTANCE Exosomes have recently been characterized as bioactive vesicles that function to promote intercellular communication. The exosomes from virally infected cells containing altered compositions confer numerous novel functionalities. A study of the secretome of cells infected with PRRSV indicated that the exosomal pathway is strongly activated by PRRSV infection. Here, we demonstrate that PRRSV can utilize host exosomes to infect naive healthy cells. Furthermore, exosome-mediated viral transmission is largely resistant to PRRSV-specific neutralizing antibodies. Our study provides novel insights into an alternative mechanism of PRRSV transmission that can compromise the host's anti-PRRSV immune response.	PMC5790938

Clin Cancer Res	2018	Purpose: The microenvironment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) is highly immunosuppressive. HNSCCs expressing elevated levels of PD-L1 have especially poor outcome. Exosomes that carry PD-L1 and suppress T-cell functions have been isolated from plasma of patients with HNSCC. The potential contributions of PD-L1+ exosomes to immune suppression and disease activity are evaluated.Experimental Design: Exosomes isolated from plasma of 40 HNSCC patients by size exclusion chromatography were captured on beads using anti-CD63 Abs, stained for PD-1 and PD-L1 and analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentages and mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of PD-L1+ and PD-1+ exosome/bead complexes were correlated with the patients' clinicopathologic data. PD-L1high or PD-L1low exosomes were incubated with activated CD69+ human CD8+ T cells ± PD-1 inhibitor. Changes in CD69 expression levels on T cells were measured. Patients' plasma was tested for soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) by ELISA.Results: Levels of PD-L1 carried by exosomes correlated with patients' disease activity, the UICC stage and the lymph node status (P = 0.0008-0.013). In contrast, plasma levels of sPD-L1 or exosome PD-1 levels did not correlate with any clinicopathologic parameters. CD69 expression levels were inhibited (P < 0.03) by coincubation with PD-L1high but not by PD-L1low exosomes. Blocking of PD-L1+ exosome signaling to PD-1+ T cells attenuated immune suppression.Conclusions: PD-L1 levels on exosomes, but not levels of sPD-L1, associated with disease progression in HNSCC patients. Circulating PD-L1+ exosomes emerge as useful metrics of disease and immune activity in HNSCC patients. SIGNIFICANCE: Circulating PD-L1high exosomes in HNC patients' plasma but not soluble PD-L1 levels associate with disease progression. Clin Cancer Res; 24(4); 896-905. ©2017 AACR.

Exosomal small RNA sequencing uncovers the microRNA dose markers for power frequency electromagnetic field exposure.	Biomarkers	2018 May - Jun	PURPOSE: The potential health risks caused by power frequency electromagnetic field (PFEMF) have led to increase public health concerns. However, the diagnosis and prognosis remain challenging in determination of exact dose of PFEMF exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were exposed to different magnetic doses of PFEMF for the following isolation of serum exosomes, microRNAs (miRNAs) extraction and small RNA sequencing. After small RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) validation and serum exosomal miRNA biomarkers were determined. RESULTS: Significantly changed serum exosomal miRNA as biomarkers of 0.1, 0.5, 2.5 mT and common PFEMF exposure were confirmed. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the downstream target genes of the above-identified exosomal miRNA markers indicated that, exosomal miRNA markers were predicted to be involved in critical pathophysiological processes of neural system and cancer- or other disease-related signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrantly-expressed serum exosomal miRNAs, including miR-128-3p for 0.1 mT, miR-133a-3p for 0.5 mT, miR-142a-5p for 2.5 mT, miR-218-5p and miR-199a-3p for common PFEMF exposure, suggested a series of informative markers for not only identifying the exact dose of PFEMF exposure, also consolidating the base for future clinical intervention.

HPB (Oxford)	2018	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are nanovesicles that have been shown to mediate carcinogenesis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Given the direct communication of pancreatic duct fluid with the tumor and its relative accessibility, we aimed to determine the feasibility of isolating and characterizing exosomes from pancreatic duct fluid. METHODS: Pancreatic duct fluid was collected from 26 patients with PDAC (n = 13), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) (n = 8) and other benign pancreatic diseases (n = 5) at resection. Exosomes were isolated by serial ultracentrifugation, proteins were identified by mass spectrometry, and their expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Exosomes were isolated from all specimens with a mean concentration of 5.9 ± 1 × 108 particles/mL and most frequent size of 138 ± 9 nm. Among the top 35 proteins that were significantly associated with PDAC, multiple carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins were identified. Interestingly, CEACAM 1/5 expression by immunohistochemistry was seen only on tumor epithelia whereas tenascin C positivity was restricted to stroma, suggesting that both tumor and stromal cells contributed to exosomes. CONCLUSION: This is the first study showing that exosome isolation is feasible from pancreatic duct fluid, and that exosomal proteins may be utilized to diagnose patients with PDAC.

J Cardiovasc Transl Res	2018	Exosomes are small-sized vesicles that can be released from cells into the serum. Exosomes play important roles in regulating many biological processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and metabolism. However, the roles and mechanisms of plasma exosomes in the apoptosis of rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes are largely unknown. In this study, we isolated plasma exosomes as confirmed by the marker protein CD63. Using flow cytometry and western blot analysis, we found that exosomes attenuated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis and improved survival of rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the anti-apoptosis effects of serum exosomes in rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes were mediated by the activation of ERK1/2 signaling pathway. These data indicated that plasma exosomes had the protective effects against cardiomyocyte apoptosis and might be a novel therapy strategy for myocardial injury.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2018	Bone metastatic lesions are classified as osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions. Prostate and breast cancer patients frequently exhibit osteoblastic-type and osteolytic-type bone metastasis, respectively. In metastatic lesions, tumor cells interact with many different cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mesenchymal stem cells, resulting in an osteoblastic or osteolytic phenotype. However, the mechanisms responsible for the modification of bone remodeling have not been fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are transferred between cells via exosomes and serve as intercellular communication tools, and numerous studies have demonstrated that cancer-secreted miRNAs are capable of modifying the tumor microenvironment. Thus, cancer-secreted miRNAs can induce an osteoblastic or osteolytic phenotype in the bone metastatic microenvironment. In this study, we performed a comprehensive expression analysis of exosomal miRNAs secreted by several human cancer cell lines and identified eight types of human miRNAs that were highly expressed in exosomes from osteoblastic phenotype-inducing prostate cancer cell lines. One of these miRNAs, hsa-miR-940, significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro by targeting ARHGAP1 and FAM134A Interestingly, although MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells are commonly known as an osteolytic phenotype-inducing cancer cell line, the implantation of miR-940-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells induced extensive osteoblastic lesions in the resulting tumors by facilitating the osteogenic differentiation of host mesenchymal cells. Our results suggest that the phenotypes of bone metastases can be induced by miRNAs secreted by cancer cells in the bone microenvironment.	PMC5834702

Int J Mol Sci	2018	Progressive cerebral accumulation of tau aggregates is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A popular theory that seeks to explain the apparent spread of neurofibrillary tangle pathology proposes that aggregated tau is passed from neuron to neuron. Such a templated seeding process requires that the transferred tau contains the microtubule binding repeat domains that are necessary for aggregation. While it is not clear how a protein such as tau can move from cell to cell, previous reports have suggested that this may involve extracellular vesicles (EVs). Thus, measurement of tau in EVs may both provide insights on the molecular pathology of AD and facilitate biomarker development. Here, we report the use of sensitive immunoassays specific for full-length (FL) tau and mid-region tau, which we applied to analyze EVs from human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuron (iN) conditioned media, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma. In each case, most tau was free-floating with a small component inside EVs. The majority of free-floating tau detected by the mid-region assay was not detected by our FL assays, indicating that most free-floating tau is truncated. Inside EVs, the mid-region assay also detected more tau than the FL assay, but the ratio of FL-positive to mid-region-positive tau was higher inside exosomes than in free solution. These studies demonstrate the presence of minute amounts of free-floating and exosome-contained FL tau in human biofluids. Given the potential for FL tau to aggregate, we conclude that further investigation of these pools of extracellular tau and how they change during disease is merited.	PMC5877524

Human embryonic stem cells extracellular vesicles and their effects on immortalized human retinal Müller cells.	PLoS One	2018	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by virtually every cell of all organisms are involved in processes of intercellular communication through the delivery of their functional mRNAs, proteins and bioactive lipids. We previously demonstrated that mouse embryonic stem cell-released EVs (mESEVs) are able to transfer their content to different target retinal cells, inducing morphological and biochemical changes in them. The main objective of this paper is to characterize EVs derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESEVs) and investigate the effects that they have on cultured retinal glial, progenitor Müller cells, which are known to give rise to retinal neurons under specific conditions. This would allow us to establish if hESEVs have a pro-regenerative potential not yet described that could be used in the future for treatment of human retinal degenerative diseases. Initially, we showed that hESEVs are heterogeneous in size, contain mRNAs and proteins involved in the induction and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency and can be internalized by cultured Müller cells. After a single exposure to hESEVs these cells display changes in their gene expression profile, and with multiple exposures they de-differentiate and trans-differentiate into retinal neuronal precursors. hESEVs were then fractionated into microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes (EXOs), which were characterized by size, specific surface proteins and biochemical/molecular components. We demonstrate that despite the similar internalization of non-fractionated hESEVs, MVs and EXOs by Müller progenitor cells, in vitro, only the release of MVs' cargo into the cells' cytoplasm induces specific changes in their levels of pluripotency mRNAs and early retinal proteins. EXOs do not produce any detectable effect. Thus, we conclude that MVs and MVs-containing hESEVs are promising agents that possibly could promote the regeneration of diseased or damaged retinas in vivo through inducing glial Müller cells to become replacement neurons.

They remain relatively poorly studied, however, since they are challenging to extract from biological media. One difficulty is the presence of a mineral content in comparison to pure lipid vesicles, meaning that standard separation process such as ultracentrifugation are unable to precisely separate on the basis of size or weight. In this paper we report the separation of matrix vesicles from an organotypic bone culture system using a process of immunoprecipitation. Matrix vesicles were extracted using polymeric beads that were modified with an antibody for tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNALP), a surface marker abundant in bone-derived vesicles. The vesicles isolated were positive for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the substrate for TNALP and were demonstrated to have a high-binding affinity to type I collagen, the principal collagen type found in bone. This protocol enables more detailed study of the process and regulation of mineralisation.	PMC5819369

Amniotic Fluid Exosome Proteomic Profile Exhibits Unique Pathways of Term and Preterm Labor.	Endocrinology	2018	Our objective was to determine the amniotic fluid-derived exosomal proteomic profile in patients who had spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) or preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM) compared with those who delivered at term. A cross-sectional study of a retrospective cohort was used to quantify and determine the protein content of exosomes present in amniotic fluid, in PTB or pPROM, and normal term labor (TL) or term not in labor (TNIL) pregnancies. Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation and quantified using nanocrystals (Qdot) coupled to CD63 and placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) by fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis. The exosomal proteomic profile was identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and a small ion library was constructed to quantify the proteomic data by Sequential Window Acquisition of All Theoretical analysis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis determined canonical pathways and biofunctions associated with dysregulated proteins. Amniotic fluid exosomes have similar shape and quantity regardless of the conditions; however, the PLAP/CD63 ratios for TL, PTB, and pPROM were significantly higher (∼3.8-, ∼4.4-, and ∼3.5-fold, respectively) compared with TNIL. The PLAP/CD63 ratio was also significantly higher (∼1.3-fold) in PTB compared with pPROM. Biological functions primarily indicated nonspecific inflammatory response regardless of condition, but unique profiles were also identified in cases (PTB and pPROM) compared with term. Amniotic fluid exosomes provide information specific to normal and abnormal parturition. Inflammatory marker enrichment and its uniqueness in term and preterm pregnancies support the value of exosomes in determining underlying physiology associated with term and preterm parturition.

Exosome: Function and Role in Cancer Metastasis and Drug Resistance.	Technol Cancer Res Treat	2018	As a kind of nanometric lipidic vesicles, exosomes have been presumed to play a leading role in the regulation of tumor microenvironment through exosomes-mediated transfer of proteins and genetic materials. Tumor-derived exosomes are recognized as a critical determinant of the tumor progression. Intriguingly, some current observations have identified that exosomes are essential for several intercellular exchanges of proteins, messenger RNAs, noncoding RNAs (including long noncoding RNAs and microRNAs) as well as to the process of cancer metastasis and drug resistance. Herein, we review the role of exosomes and their molecular cargos in cancer invasion and metastasis, summarize how they interact with antitumor agents, and highlight their translational implications.

Anal Chim Acta	2018	Alzheimer's disease (AD) considered as the third health "killer" has seriously threatened the health of the elderly. However, the modern diagnostic strategies of AD present several disadvantages: the low accuracy and specificity resulting in some false-negative diagnoses, and the poor sensitivity leading to a delayed treatment. In view of this situation, a enzyme-free and target-triggered signal amplification strategy, based on graphene oxide (GO) and entropy-driven strand displacement reaction (ESDR) principle, was proposed. In this strategy, when the hairpin structure probes (H)specially binds with beta-amyloid-(1-42) oligomers (Aβ42 oligomers), it's structure will be opened, causing the bases complementary to FAM-labeled replacement probes R (R1 and R2) exposed. At this time, R1 and R2 will hybridize with H, resulting in the bound Aβ42 oligomers released. The released Aβ42 oligomers would participate in the next cycle reaction, making the signal amplified. As a quencher, GO could absorb the free single-stranded DNA R1 and R2 and quench their fluorescence; however, the DNA duplex still exists free and keeps its signal-on. Through the detection of Aβ42 oligomers in exosomes, this ultrasensitive detection method with the advantages of low limit of detection (LOD, 20 pM), great accuracy, excellent precision and convenience provides an excellent prospect for AD's early diagnosis.

Science	2018	Some pathogens and pests deliver small RNAs (sRNAs) into host cells to suppress host immunity. Conversely, hosts also transfer sRNAs into pathogens and pests to inhibit their virulence. Although sRNA trafficking has been observed in a wide variety of interactions, how sRNAs are transferred, especially from hosts to pathogens/pests, is still unknown. Here we show that host Arabidopsis cells secrete exosome-like extracellular vesicles to deliver sRNAs into fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea These sRNA-containing vesicles accumulate at the infection sites and are taken up by the fungal cells. Transferred host sRNAs induce silencing of fungal genes critical for pathogenicity. Thus, Arabidopsis has adapted exosome-mediated cross-kingdom RNA interference as part of its immune responses during the evolutionary arms race with the pathogen.

Follicular dendritic cells carry MHC class II-expressing microvesicles at their surface.	J Immunol	2000	Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) present in lymphoid follicles play a critical role in germinal center reactions. They trap native Ags in the form of immune complexes providing a source for continuous stimulation of specific B lymphocytes. FDCs have been reported to express MHC class II molecules, suggesting an additional role in the presentation of not only native, but also processed Ag in the form of peptide-loaded MHC class II. Adoptive bone marrow transfer experiments have shown that MHC class II molecules are only passively acquired. Up to now the origin of these MHC class II molecules was not clear. Here we show by cryoimmunogold electron microscopy that MHC class II molecules are not present at the plasma membrane of FDCs. In contrast, microvesicles attached to the FDC surface contain MHC class II and other surface proteins not expressed by FDCs themselves. The size and marker profiles of these microvesicles resemble exosomes. Exosomes, which are secreted internal vesicles from multivesicular endosomes, have been shown earlier to stimulate proliferation of specific T lymphocytes in vitro, but their target in vivo remained a matter of speculation. We demonstrate here that isolated exosomes in vitro bind specifically to FDCs and not to other cell types, suggesting that FDCs might be a physiological target for exosomes.

Starzl Transplantation Institute, Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. .	morelli@imap.pitt.edu		Endocytosis, intracellular sorting, and processing of exosomes by dendritic cells.	Blood	2004	Exosomes are nanovesicles released by leukocytes and epithelial cells. Although their function remains enigmatic, exosomes are a source of antigen and transfer functional major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I/peptide complexes to dendritic cells (DCs) for CD8(+) T-cell activation. Here we demonstrate that exosomes also are internalized and processed by immature DCs for presentation to CD4(+) T cells. Endocytosed exosomes are sorted into the endocytic compartment of DCs for processing, followed by loading of exosome-derived peptides in MHC-II molecules for presentation to CD4(+) T cells. Targeting of exosomes to DCs is mediated via milk fat globule (MFG)-E8/lactadherin, CD11a, CD54, phosphatidylserine, and the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 on the exosome and alpha(v)/beta(3) integrin, and CD11a and CD54 on the DCs. Circulating exosomes are internalized by DCs and specialized phagocytes of the spleen and by hepatic Kupffer cells. Internalization of blood-borne allogeneic exosomes by splenic DCs does not affect DC maturation and is followed by loading of the exosome-derived allopeptide IEalpha(52-68) in IA(b) by host CD8alpha(+) DCs for presentation to CD4(+) T cells. These data imply that exosomes present in circulation or extracellular fluids constitute an alternative source of self- or allopeptides for DCs during maintenance of peripheral tolerance or initiation of the indirect pathway of allorecognition in transplantation.

Immunology	2005	Oral administration of a protein antigen generates a serum factor that induces tolerance when transferred into naïve recipients. This serum factor has been described in rats as consisting of exosome-like structures or tolerosomes, which express major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (MHCII) and mediate antigen-specific tolerance. In this study, we investigated the functions of serum-derived tolerosomes both in vivo and in vitro. Tolerosomes were purified from the 100,000 g pellet fraction of serum from ovalbumin (OVA)-fed mice. When transferred into naïve recipient mice, the tolerosomes mediated OVA-specific tolerance. We also found that tolerosomes from OVA-fed mice induced the activation of OVA-specific T cells both in vivo and in vitro. The inoculation of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice with an interferon-gamma-producing cell line normalized the expression of MHCII in the intestinal epithelial cells and restored their ability to generate tolerosomes. Syngeneic but not allogeneic transfer of tolerosomes from OVA-fed donors induced tolerance in the recipients. Our results show that tolerosomes can be isolated from mouse serum, that tolerosome-induced oral tolerance requires MHCII expression in intestinal epithelial cells, and that tolerosomes are functional only in syngeneic recipients.

Raman Avenue, Malleswaram, Bangalore, Karnataka 560012, India. <>	balaji@mcbl.iisc.ernet.in		Apoptosis triggered by Rv1818c, a PE family gene from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is regulated by mitochondrial intermediates in T cells.	Microbes Infect	2007	Ectopic expression of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis PE-family gene Rv1818c, triggers apoptosis in the mammalian Jurkat T cells, which is blocked by anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Although complete overlap is not observed, a considerable proportion of cellular pools of ectopically expressed Rv1818c localizes to mitochondria. However, recombinant Rv1818c does not trigger release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria even though Rv1818c protein induced apoptosis of Jurkat T cells. Apoptosis induced by Rv1818c is blocked by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitory peptide zVAD-FMK. Unexpectedly, Rv1818c-induced apoptosis is not blocked in a Jurkat sub-clone deficient for caspase-8 (JI 9.2) or in cells where caspase-9 function is inhibited or expression of caspase-9 reduced by siRNA, arguing against a central role for these caspases in Rv1818c-induced apoptotic signaling. Depleting cellular pools of the mitochondrial protein Smac/DIABLO substantially reduces apoptosis consistent with mitochondrial involvement in this death pathway. We present evidence that Rv1818c-induced apoptosis is blocked by the co-transfection of an endogenous inhibitor of caspase activation, XIAP in T cells. Additionally, Rv1818c is released into extracellular environment via exosomes secreted by M. tuberculosis infected BM-DC's and macrophages. Furthermore, the extracellular Rv1818c protein can be detected in T cells co-cultured with infected BM-DC's. Taken together, these data suggest that Rv1818c-induced apoptotic signaling is likely regulated in part by the Smac-dependent activation of caspases in T cells.

Antigen presentation by exosomes released from peptide-pulsed dendritic cells is not suppressed by the presence of active CTL.	J Immunol	2007	Despite the potency of dendritic cells (DCs) as a vaccine carrier, they are short-lived and sensitive to CTL-mediated elimination. Thus, it is believed that the longevity of Ag presentation by peptide-pulsed DC is limited in vivo. Surprisingly, however, we found that although the majority of injected DCs disappeared from the draining lymph nodes within 7 days, Ag presentation persisted for at least 14 days following DC immunization. This prolonged Ag presentation was not mediated by the remaining injected DCs or through Ag transfer to endogenous APCs. We provide evidence that exosomes released by DCs might be responsible for the persistence of Ag presentation. Functional exosomes could be recovered from the draining lymph nodes of C57BL/6 mice following DC vaccination and, in contrast to DCs, T cell stimulation by exosomes in vivo was not affected by the presence of CTL. Our findings demonstrate that Ag presentation following delivery of DC vaccines persists for longer than expected and indicate that the exosome may play a previously unrecognized role in Ag presentation following DC vaccination. Furthermore, our study reinforces the application of exosomes as a vaccination platform and suggests that exosome-based vaccines may be advantageous for booster immunizations due to their resistance to CTL.

Heat shock protein-containing exosomes in mid-trimester amniotic fluids.	J Reprod Immunol	2008	Exosomes are multivesicular bodies formed by inverse membrane budding into the lumen of an endocytic compartment. Fusion with the plasma membrane leads to their release into the external milieu. The incorporation of heat shock proteins into exosomes has been associated with immune regulatory activity. We have examined whether heat shock protein-containing exosomes are present in mid-trimester amniotic fluid. Exosomes were isolated from mid-trimester amniotic fluids by sequential low-speed and high-speed centrifugation followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Biochemical characterization included floatation pattern in sucrose gradients, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and Western blot analysis for exosome-containing proteins. Exosomes were present in each of 23 amniotic fluids tested. They banded at a density of 1.17g/ml in sucrose gradients, were positive for AChE activity and contained tubulin, the inducible 72kDa heat shock protein, Hsp72 and the constitutively expressed heat shock protein, Hsc73; they were negative for calnexin. Exosome concentrations correlated positively with the number of pregnancies. Heat shock protein-containing exosomes are constituents of mid-trimester amniotic fluids and may contribute to immune regulation within the amniotic cavity.

No significant CTL cross-priming by dendritic cell-derived exosomes during murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection.	J Immunol	2009	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles of endocytic origin that are secreted by most cells in culture, but are also present in serum. They contain a wide array of protein ligands on their surface, which has led to the hypothesis that they might mediate intercellular communication. Indeed, data support that exosomes can transfer Ags to dendritic cells (DC), and, interestingly, that these DC can subsequently induce T cell priming or tolerance. We have investigated whether this concept can be expanded to antiviral immunity. We isolated exosomes from supernatant of cultured bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) that were infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or loaded with an immunodominant LCMV peptide, and characterized them by flow cytometry upon binding to beads. We then incubated the exosome preparations with BMDC and looked at their potential to activate LCMV gp33-specific naive and memory CD8 T cells. We found that exosomes do not significantly contribute to CD8 T cell cross-priming in vitro. Additionally, exosomes derived from in vitro-infected BMDC did not exhibit significant in vivo priming activity, as evidenced by the lack of protection following exosome vaccination. Thus, DC-derived exosomes do not appear to contribute significantly to CTL priming during acute LCMV infection.

Immunogenicity of allo-vesicle carrying ERBB2 tumor antigen for dendritic cell-based anti-tumor immunotherapy.	Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol	2009 Jul-Sep	Dendritic cells (DCs) are able to orchestrate innate and acquired immunity and can activate and sustain a long-lasting anti-tumor immune response in vivo when used as anti-tumor cell therapy. The selection of the antigen and the choice of its formulation are key points in designing anti-cancer DC-based vaccines. Cell released vesicles/exosomes have been shown to transfer antigens, HLAI/peptide complexes and co-stimulatory molecules to recipient cells. In this study we describe the generation of an allogenic microvesicle cell factory in which the expression of a specific tumor antigen was combined to the expression of co-stimulatory and allogeneic molecules. The DG75 lymphoblastoid cell line was selected as microvesicle producer and transfected with ErbB2, as tumor antigen prototype. The shed microvesicles transferred antigenic components to recipient DCs, increasing their immunogenicity. DC pulsing resulted in cross-presentation of ErbB2 both in HLAI and HLAII compartments, and ErbB2-specific CD8+ T cells from cancer patients were activated by DCs pulsed with vesicle-bound ErbB2. The microvesicle cell factory proposed may represent a source of cell free immunogen to be used for DC-based cancer therapy.

Arthritis Rheum	2010	OBJECTIVE: We previously observed that T lymphocytes present in synovial fluid (SF) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were sensitive to APO2L/TRAIL. In addition, there was a drastic decrease in the amount of bioactive APO2L/TRAIL associated with exosomes in SF from RA patients. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of bioactive APO2L/TRAIL conjugated with artificial lipid vesicles resembling natural exosomes as a treatment in a rabbit model of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). METHODS: We used a novel Ni(2+)-(N-5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)-iminodiacetic acid)-containing liposomal system. APO2L/TRAIL bound to liposomes was intraarticularly injected into the knees of animals with AIA. One week after treatment, rabbits were killed, and arthritic synovial tissue was analyzed. RESULTS: Tethering APO2L/TRAIL to the liposome membrane increased its bioactivity and resulted in more effective treatment of AIA compared with soluble, unconjugated APO2L/TRAIL, with substantially reduced synovial hyperplasia and inflammation in rabbit knee joints. The results of biophysical studies suggested that the increased bioactivity of APO2L/TRAIL associated with liposomes was due to the increase in the local concentration of the recombinant protein, augmenting its receptor crosslinking potential, and not to conformational changes in the protein. In spite of this increase in bioactivity, the treatment lacked systemic toxicity and was not hepatotoxic. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that binding APO2L/TRAIL to the liposome membrane increases its bioactivity and results in effective treatment of AIA.

Exosomal-like vesicles with immune-modulatory features are present in human plasma and can induce CD4+ T-cell apoptosis in vitro.	Transfusion	2011	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are small membrane vesicles that are secreted from many cell types into various body fluids. These vesicles are thought to play a role in cell-cell interactions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Vesicles were isolated from human plasma of healthy donors by differential ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration. The vesicles were identified by transmission electron microscopy, and their biochemical characteristics were analyzed by Western blot and flow cytometry. The immune-modulatory ability of exosomal-like vesicles was examined by incubating them with CD4+ T cells for CD4+ T-cell proliferation and apoptosis assays in vitro. RESULTS: Vesicles purified from human plasma displayed shapes and sizes similar to those of previously described exosomes and contained exosomes marker proteins CD63 and CD81. They also expressed molecules such as MHC Class II molecules, CD80, CD86, and the cell signal transduction molecules Wnt3a, Wnt5a, and FasL. Furthermore, functional analysis showed that allogeneic plasma exosomes restrained the survival of CD4+ T cells. Plasma exosomes can induce dose-dependent suppression of proliferation of activated CD4+ T cells, with the strongest responses induced by 500 µg/mL exosomes in vitro. Antibodies against exosomes FasL can block the activity of exosomes on CD4+ T-cell apoptosis. Moreover, three different concentrations of CD4+ T cells were inhibited by plasma exosomes and the suppressive function was not dependent on interleukin-2. CONCLUSION: Exosomes present in human plasma contain immunity-associated molecules and can induce CD4+ T-cell apoptosis in vitro. Plasma exosomes have the capacity to influence immune responses.

Human trophoblast-derived exosomal fibronectin induces pro-inflammatory IL-1β production by macrophages.	Am J Reprod Immunol	2011	PROBLEM Our previous studies demonstrated that trophoblast-derived exosomes induced synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) by macrophages. The objective of this study was to characterize the mechanism and receptors associated with this induction. METHOD OF STUDY Exosomes were isolated from Sw71 trophoblast-conditioned media by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation. Using macrophages isolated from normal donors, cytochalasin D was used to block exosome uptake. Induction of IL-1β mRNA was investigated by qRT-PCR, pro-IL-1β protein by western immunoblotting, and mature IL-1β release by ELISA. RGD peptides were used to block fibronectin binding by macrophage α5β1 integrin. RESULTS Uptake of exosomes by macrophages was completely blocked by pre-treatment with cytochalasin D. Although induction of some cytokines (such as C4A and CCL11) requires uptake, induction of IL-1β occurred without exosome internalization. Cytochalasin D treatment did not inhibit exosome-mediated induction of IL-1β mRNA, production of the pro-protein, or release of mature IL-1β. Blocking of fibronectin binding using RGD peptides demonstrated the abrogation of exosome-mediated IL-1β production. CONCLUSION Although trophoblast-derived exosomes have been demonstrated to induce IL-1β, this is the first demonstration of IL-1β induction by exosome-associated fibronectin. Based on this pro-inflammatory role of exosome-associated fibronectin, it may represent an important general immunoregulatory mechanism.

Cutting edge: HLA-DO impairs the incorporation of HLA-DM into exosomes.	J Immunol	2011	In multivesicular bodies, HLA-DM (DM) assists the loading of antigenic peptides on classical MHC class II molecules such as HLA-DR. In cells expressing HLA-DO (DO), DM is redistributed from the internal vesicles to the limiting membrane of these organelles. This suggests that DO might reduce DM incorporation into exosomes, which are shed upon fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we used the 721.45 B lymphoblastoid cell line and different HeLa cell transfectants. We demonstrate that the poor recovery of DM in exosomes as compared with HLA-DR is not the mere reflection of differences in protein expression. Indeed, we found that DO contributes to the inefficient transfer of DM to exosomes. This negative regulation requires an intact di-leucine endosomal sorting motif in the cytoplasmic tail of HLA-DOβ. These results demonstrate that canonical sorting signals and protein-protein interactions modulate the selection of MHC protein cargos.

Cell-secreted vesicles in equine ovarian follicular fluid contain miRNAs and proteins: a possible new form of cell communication within the ovarian follicle.	Biol Reprod	2012	Proper cell communication within the ovarian follicle is critical for the growth and maturation of a healthy oocyte that can be fertilized and develop into an embryo. Cell communication within the follicle involves many signaling molecules and is affected by maternal age. Recent studies indicate that cell communication can be mediated through secretion and uptake of small membrane-enclosed vesicles. The goals of this study were to 1) identify cell-secreted vesicles (microvesicles and exosomes) containing miRNAs and proteins within ovarian follicular fluid and 2) determine if miRNA level differs in exosomes isolated from follicular fluid in young compared to old mares. We demonstrate the presence of vesicles resembling microvesicles and exosomes in ovarian follicular fluid using transmission electron microscopy and CD63-positive and RNA containing vesicles using flow cytometry. Moreover, proteomics analysis reveals that follicular fluid-isolated exosomes contain both known exosomal proteins and proteins not previously reported in isolated exosomes. MicroRNAs were detected in microvesicle and exosomes preparations isolated from follicular fluid by real-time PCR analysis. Uptake of fluorescent-labeled microvesicles by granulosa cells was examined using in vitro and in vivo approaches. MicroRNA expression profiling reveals that miRNAs in microvesicle and exosome preparations isolated from follicular fluid also are present within surrounding granulosa and cumulus cells. These studies revealed that cell communication within the mammalian ovarian follicle may involve transfer of bioactive material by microvesicles and exosomes. Finally, miRNAs present in exosomes from ovarian follicular fluid varied with the age of the mare, and a number of different miRNAs were detected in young vs. old mare follicular fluid.

Expert Opin Biol Ther	2012	INTRODUCTION: Exosomes are nano-sized (40 - 100 nm), extracellular vesicles, of endosomal origin. They are released by cells and found in many body fluids, including plasma. Exosomes contain proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that can be transferred between cells. The discovery that exosomes contain RNA, and that this encapsulated RNA could potentially be transferred over distances in vivo, reinforced the importance of exosomes in cell-to-cell communication. AREAS COVERED: The existence of exosomes, as a naturally occurring delivery system of RNA, enables their use as both biomarkers and vectors in gene therapy. This review provides an overview of studies reporting that exosomal miRNA and mRNA in plasma can serve as a diagnostic marker in various types of cancers. In addition, the recent finding that exosomes can be used as vectors for delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) in mice, with therapeutic effects, is also reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: The data reviewed here suggest that exosomal RNA has the potential to play an important role in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases in the future.

Restoration of full-length APC protein in SW480 colon cancer cells induces exosome-mediated secretion of DKK-4.	Electrophoresis	2012	Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene are common in both inherited and sporadic forms of colorectal cancer (CRC), and are associated with dysregulated Wnt signaling. Colon carcinoma SW480 cells restored with stable expression of wild-type APC (SW480APC cells) exhibit attenuated Wnt signaling, and reduced tumorigenicity, including increased cell adhesion. We performed a comparative proteomic analysis of exosomes isolated from SW480 and SW480APC cells to examine the effects of restored APC on exosome protein expression. A salient finding of our study was the unique expression of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-related protein 4 (DKK4) in SW480APC, but not parental SW480 cell-derived exosomes. Upregulation of DKK4 in SW480APC cells was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunogold electron microscopy. Analysis of the DKK4 gene promoter by methylation-specific PCR revealed reduced methylation in SW480APC cells, while RT-PCR demonstrated the downregulation of DNMT-3a, compared to the parental cell line. Our discovery of exosome-mediated secretion of DKK4 opens up the possibility that exosomal DKK4 may be a mechanism used by epithelial colon cells to regulate Wnt signaling which is lost during CRC progression.

Circulating miRNA profiles in patients with metabolic syndrome.	J Clin Endocrinol Metab	2012	CONTEXT: Coordinated interplay of dysregulated microRNAs in isolated metabolic disorder is implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to characterize microRNA expression in the blood and exosomes of individuals with metabolic syndrome and compare them with those manifesting one of the metabolic vascular risk factors (type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension). RESEARCH DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 265 participants were recruited in a health screening and characterized into distinct groups as follows: 1) healthy controls (n = 46); 2) metabolic syndrome (n = 50); 3) type 2 diabetes (n = 50); 4) hypercholesterolemia (n = 89); and 5) hypertension (n = 30). Total RNA was subjected to microRNA profiling, and a panel of significantly dysregulated microRNAs was validated using quantitative PCR. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Analysis of profiling data characterized unique pools of miRNAs that could categorize the different risk factors of metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: We have identified miR-197, miR-23a, and miR-509-5p as potential contributors of dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome (correlation with body mass index; P = 0.029, 0.021, and 0.042, respectively) and miR-130a and miR-195 as contributors of hypertension (correlation with blood pressure; P = 0.019 and 0.045, respectively). A plausible association of miR-27a and miR-320a with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes patients has also been found because these miRNAs remained dysregulated in both cases (correlation with fasting glucose; P = 0.010 and 0.016, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Significant dysregulation of seven candidate microRNAs has been found to be associated with risks involved in the manifestation of metabolic syndrome.

J Allergy Clin Immunol	2013	BACKGROUND: Asthma is characterized by increased airway narrowing in response to nonspecific stimuli. The disorder is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Exosomes are nanosized vesicles of endosomal origin released from inflammatory and epithelial cells that have been implicated in asthma. In this study we characterized the microRNA (miRNA) content of exosomes in healthy control subjects and patients with mild intermittent asthma both at unprovoked baseline and in response to environmental challenge. OBJECTIVE: To investigate alterations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) exosomal miRNA profiles due to asthma, and following subway air exposure. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from BALF from healthy control subjects (n = 10) and patients with mild intermittent asthma (n = 10) after subway and control exposures. Exosomal RNA was analyzed by using microarrays containing probes for 894 human miRNAs, and selected findings were validated with quantitative RT-PCR. Results were analyzed by using multivariate modeling. RESULTS: The presence of miRNAs was confirmed in exosomes from BALF of both asthmatic patients and healthy control subjects. Significant differences in BALF exosomal miRNA was detected for 24 miRNAs with a subset of 16 miRNAs, including members of the let-7 and miRNA-200 families, providing robust classification of patients with mild nonsymptomatic asthma from healthy subjects with 72% cross-validated predictive power (Q(2) = 0.72). In contrast, subway exposure did not cause any significant alterations in miRNA profiles. CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate substantial differences in exosomal miRNA profiles between healthy subjects and patients with unprovoked, mild, stable asthma. These changes might be important in the inflammatory response leading to bronchial hyperresponsiveness and asthma.	PMC4013392

Blood	2013	Signaling between endothelial cells, endothelial progenitor cells, and stromal cells is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of vascular integrity and involves exosomes, among other signaling pathways. Exosomes are important mediators of intercellular communication in immune signaling, tumor survival, stress responses, and angiogenesis. The ability of exosomes to incorporate and transfer messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding for "acquired" proteins or micro RNAs (miRNAs) repressing "resident" mRNA translation suggests that they can influence the physiological behavior of recipient cells. We demonstrate that miR-214, an miRNA that controls endothelial cell function and angiogenesis, plays a dominant role in exosome-mediated signaling between endothelial cells. Endothelial cell-derived exosomes stimulated migration and angiogenesis in recipient cells, whereas exosomes from miR-214-depleted endothelial cells failed to stimulate these processes. Exosomes containing miR-214 repressed the expression of ataxia telangiectasia mutated in recipient cells, thereby preventing senescence and allowing blood vessel formation. Concordantly, specific reduction of miR-214 content in exosome-producing endothelial cells abolishes the angiogenesis stimulatory function of the resulting exosomes. Collectively, our data indicate that endothelial cells release miR-214-containing exosomes to stimulate angiogenesis through the silencing of ataxia telangiectasia mutated in neighboring target cells.

Analysis of viral microRNA exchange via exosomes in vitro and in vivo.	Methods Mol Biol	2013	The isolation and analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) contained in microvesicles and in particular nano-sized exosomes has become an increasingly important tool to understand their widespread impact in various fundamental and interactive cellular processes. Fundamental studies regarding exosome biogenesis and miRNA sorting may ultimately unravel their potency as a promising class of highly specific disease biomarkers. Here we describe the methods and protocols used in our laboratory to isolate and purify exosomes, how we extract the (small) RNA content, how to analyze copy numbers, and finally how to measure exosome-mediated transfer of these molecules into recipient cells. Our techniques have been optimized for the detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded miRNAs that are loaded into exosomes. We discuss how a focus on EBV-miRNA detection may yield important new clues into exosome-mediated cross talk by B cells in humans.

Transplantation of human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells cures the corneal defects of mucopolysaccharidosis VII mice.	Stem Cells	2013	Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) are a family of related disorders caused by a mutation in one of the lysosomal exoglycosidases which leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). MPS VII, caused by a mutation in β-glucuronidase, manifests hepatomegaly, skeletal dysplasia, short stature, corneal clouding, and developmental delay. Current treatment regimens for MPS are not effective for treating corneal clouding and impaired mental development. We hypothesized that human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) transplanted into the corneal stroma could participate in the catabolism of GAGs providing a means of cell therapy for MPS. For such treatment, human UMSCs were intrastromally transplanted into corneas of MPS VII mice. UMSC transplantation restored the dendritic and hexagonal morphology of host keratocytes and endothelial cells, respectively, and in vivo confocal microscopy (HRT-II) revealed reduced corneal haze. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains as well as lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 revealed a decrease in GAG content and both lysosomal number and size in the treated corneas. Labeling UMSC intracellular compartments prior to transplantation revealed the distribution of UMSC vesicles throughout the corneal stroma and endothelium. An in vitro coculture assay between skin fibroblasts isolated from MPS VII mice and UMSC demonstrated that neutral vesicles released by the UMSC are taken up by the fibroblasts and proceed to fuse with the acidic lysosomes. Therefore, transplanted UMSCs participate both in extracellular GAG turnover and enable host keratocytes to catabolize accumulated GAG products, suggesting that UMSC could be a novel alternative for treating corneal defects associated with MPS and other congenital metabolic disorders.

Delivery of Functional Anti-miR-9 by Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Exosomes to Glioblastoma Multiforme Cells Conferred Chemosensitivity.	Mol Ther Nucleic Acids	2013	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and lethal tumor of the adult brain, generally shows chemo- and radioresistance. MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate physiological processes, such as resistance of GBM cells to temozolomide (TMZ). Although miRs are attractive targets for cancer therapeutics, the effectiveness of this approach requires targeted delivery. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can migrate to the sites of cancers, including GBM. We report on an increase in miR-9 in TMZ-resistant GBM cells. miR-9 was involved in the expression of the drug efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein. To block miR-9, methods were developed with Cy5-tagged anti-miR-9. Dye-transfer studies indicated intracellular communication between GBM cells and MSCs. This occurred by gap junctional intercellular communication and the release of microvesicles. In both cases, anti-miR-9 was transferred from MSCs to GBM cells. However, the major form of transfer occurred with the microvesicles. The delivery of anti-miR-9 to the resistant GBM cells reversed the expression of the multidrug transporter and sensitized the GBM cells to TMZ, as shown by increased cell death and caspase activity. The data showed a potential role for MSCs in the functional delivery of synthetic anti-miR-9 to reverse the chemoresistance of GBM cells.Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2013) 2, e126; doi:10.1038/mtna.2013.60; published online 1 October 2013.

Distinct RNA profiles in subpopulations of extracellular vesicles: apoptotic bodies, microvesicles and exosomes.	J Extracell Vesicles	2013	INTRODUCTION: In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies aiming to understand the biology of exosomes, as well as other extracellular vesicles. However, classification of membrane vesicles and the appropriate protocols for their isolation are still under intense discussion and investigation. When isolating vesicles, it is crucial to use systems that are able to separate them, to avoid cross-contamination. METHOD: EVS RELEASED FROM THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CELL LINES: HMC-1, TF-1 and BV-2 were isolated using two centrifugation-based protocols. In protocol 1, apoptotic bodies were collected at 2,000×g, followed by filtering the supernatant through 0.8 µm pores and pelleting of microvesicles at 12,200×g. In protocol 2, apoptotic bodies and microvesicles were collected together at 16,500×g, followed by filtering of the supernatant through 0.2 µm pores and pelleting of exosomes at 120,000×g. Extracellular vesicles were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry and the RNA profiles were investigated using a Bioanalyzer(®). RESULTS: RNA profiles showed that ribosomal RNA was primary detectable in apoptotic bodies and smaller RNAs without prominent ribosomal RNA peaks in exosomes. In contrast, microvesicles contained little or no RNA except for microvesicles collected from TF-1 cell cultures. The different vesicle pellets showed highly different distribution of size, shape and electron density with typical apoptotic body, microvesicle and exosome characteristics when analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Flow cytometry revealed the presence of CD63 and CD81 in all vesicles investigated, as well as CD9 except in the TF-1-derived vesicles, as these cells do not express CD9. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that centrifugation-based protocols are simple and fast systems to distinguish subpopulations of extracellular vesicles. Different vesicles show different RNA profiles and morphological characteristics, but they are indistinguishable using CD63-coated beads for flow cytometry analysis.	PMC3823106

Glioma-associated stem cells: a novel class of tumor-supporting cells able to predict prognosis of human low-grade gliomas.	Stem Cells	2014	BACKGROUND: Translational medicine aims at transferring advances in basic science research into new approaches for diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Low-grade gliomas (LGG) have a heterogeneous clinical behavior that can be only partially predicted employing current state-of-the-art markers, hindering the decision-making process. To deepen our comprehension on tumor heterogeneity, we dissected the mechanism of interaction between tumor cells and relevant components of the neoplastic environment, isolating, from LGG and high-grade gliomas (HGG), proliferating stem cell lines from both the glioma stroma and, where possible, the neoplasm. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We isolated glioma-associated stem cells (GASC) from LGG (n=40) and HGG (n=73). GASC showed stem cell features, anchorage-independent growth, and supported the malignant properties of both A172 cells and human glioma-stem cells, mainly through the release of exosomes. Finally, starting from GASC obtained from HGG (n=13) and LGG (n=12) we defined a score, based on the expression of 9 GASC surface markers, whose prognostic value was assayed on 40 subsequent LGG-patients. At the multivariate Cox analysis, the GASC-based score was the only independent predictor of overall survival and malignant progression free-survival. CONCLUSIONS: The microenvironment of both LGG and HGG hosts non-tumorigenic multipotent stem cells that can increase in vitro the biological aggressiveness of glioma-initiating cells through the release of exosomes. The clinical importance of this finding is supported by the strong prognostic value associated with the characteristics of GASC. This patient-based approach can provide a groundbreaking method to predict prognosis and to exploit novel strategies that target the tumor stroma.

Molecules	2014	Exosomes are small membrane-bound vesicles secreted by most cell types. Exosomes contain various functional proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) that could be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. How we should store the samples before RNA isolation and whether those long term stored samples could be used for circulating RNA investigation because of RNase is unknown. The aim of the study was to determine the stability of circulating miRNA in exosomes and plasma. Exosomes were isolated from plasma samples by using ExoQuick Precipitation methods. RNA was extracted from exosomes and the corresponding plasma samples with a Qiagen miRNeasy Mini kit. The concentration of RNA was measured by a Qubit® RNA HS Assay Kit, and quantitative PCR was used for individual miRNA expression level detection. Results showed that exosomal miRNA showed extra stability under different storage conditions and no significant influence on plasma miRNA, except for short term storage at 4 °C. It is thus indicated that exosome miRNAs can be good biomarkers based on their stability under various storage conditions.

Chicken biliary exosomes enhance CD4(+)T proliferation and inhibit ALV-J replication in liver.	Biochem Cell Biol	2014	Exosomes, which are small membrane vesicles of endocytic origin, carry lipids, RNA/miRNAs, and proteins and have immune modulatory functions. In this study, we isolated exosomes from the bile of specific pathogen-free chickens, 42-43 days of age, by using an ultracentrifugation and filtration method. The density of the exosomes, isolated by sucrose gradient fractionation, was between 1.13 and 1.19 g/mL. Electron microscopic observation of the liver showed that exosomes were present in the space of Disse and bile canaliculus. Chicken biliary exosomes displayed typical saucer-shaped, rounded morphology. Using liquid chromatography mass spectrum methodology, 196 proteins, including exosomal markers and several unique proteins, were identified and compared with mouse biliary exosomes. Noteworthy, CCCH type zinc finger antiviral protein was found on chicken biliary exosomes never described before. Furthermore, our data show that chicken biliary exosomes promote the proliferation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and monocytes from liver. In addition, chicken biliary exosomes significantly inhibit avian leukosis virus subgroup J, which is an oncogenic retrovirus, from replicating in the DF-1 cell line. These data indicate that chicken biliary exosomes possess the capacity to influence the immune responses of lymphocytes and inhibit avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J).

J Immunol	2014	Exosomes, nano-sized membrane vesicles, are released by various cells and are found in many human body fluids. They are active players in intercellular communication and have immune-suppressive, immune-regulatory, and immune-stimulatory functions. EBV is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus that is associated with various lymphoid and epithelial malignancies. EBV infection of B cells in vitro induces the release of exosomes that harbor the viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). LMP1 per se mimics CD40 signaling and induces proliferation of B lymphocytes and T cell-independent class-switch recombination. Constitutive LMP1 signaling within B cells is blunted through the shedding of LMP1 via exosomes. In this study, we investigated the functional effect of exosomes derived from the DG75 Burkitt's lymphoma cell line and its sublines (LMP1 transfected and EBV infected), with the hypothesis that they might mimic exosomes released during EBV-associated diseases. We show that exosomes released during primary EBV infection of B cells harbored LMP1, and similar levels were detected in exosomes from LMP1-transfected DG75 cells. DG75 exosomes efficiently bound to human B cells within PBMCs and were internalized by isolated B cells. In turn, this led to proliferation, induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, and the production of circle and germline transcripts for IgG1 in B cells. Finally, exosomes harboring LMP1 enhanced proliferation and drove B cell differentiation toward a plasmablast-like phenotype. In conclusion, our results suggest that exosomes released from EBV-infected B cells have a stimulatory capacity and interfere with the fate of human B cells.	PMC4174405

Cell Host Microbe	2014	During Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other respiratory infections, optimal T cell activation requires pathogen transport from the lung to a local draining lymph node (LN). However, the infected inflammatory monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) that transport M. tuberculosis to the local lymph node are relatively inefficient at activating CD4 T cells, possibly due to bacterial inhibition of antigen presentation. We found that infected migratory DCs release M. tuberculosis antigens as soluble, unprocessed proteins for uptake and presentation by uninfected resident lymph node DCs. This transfer of bacterial proteins from migratory to local DCs results in optimal priming of antigen-specific CD4 T cells, which are essential in controlling tuberculosis. Additionally, this mechanism does not involve transfer of the whole bacterium and is distinct from apoptosis or exosome shedding. These findings reveal a mechanism that bypasses pathogen inhibition of antigen presentation by infected cells and generates CD4 T cell responses that control the infection.	PMC4098643

Mesenchymal stem cells deliver exogenous miRNAs to neural cells and induce their differentiation and glutamate transporter expression.	Stem Cells Dev	2014	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are potential therapeutic targets in a variety of pathological conditions in the brain; however, their clinical application is hampered by lack of efficient delivery modes. Mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSCs) migrate to sites of injury and inflammation and exert therapeutic effects in various neurological disorders. Here, we examined the ability of MSCs to deliver exogenous miRNA mimics and pre-miRNAs to human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and astrocytes and characterized the functional impact of this delivery. We found that MSCs efficiently delivered fluorescent-labeled miR-124 and miR-145 mimics to cocultured NPCs and astrocytes. We further demonstrated the delivery of the miRNAs using novel reporter plasmids that contain a sequence complementary to miR-124 or miR-145 downstream of luciferase or mCherry. Binding of the specific miRNAs to these sequences results in decreased luciferase activity or mCherry fluorescence and therefore enable analysis of miRNA delivery in living cells. The delivered exogenous miR-124 significantly decreased the expression of the target gene Sox9 by targeting its 3'-UTR, and increased the neuronal differentiation of the NPCs. In addition, the delivered miR-124 increased the expression of the glutamate transporters, EAAT1 in NPCs and EAAT2 in both NPCs and astrocytes. Similar results were obtained with MSCs transfected with pre-miR-124. The miRNA delivery was mediated by MSC-derived exosomes and was cell contact independent. These results suggest that MSCs can functionally deliver exogenous miRNAs to neural cells and provide an efficient route of therapeutic miRNA delivery to the brain in pathological conditions with clinical implications for regenerative medicine.

J Biol Chem	2014	The development of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in three recipients of non-leukoreduced red blood cells from asymptomatic donors who subsequently developed the disease has confirmed existing concerns about the possible spread of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) via blood products. In addition, the presence of disease-associated misfolded prion protein (PrP(TSE)), generally associated with infectivity, has been demonstrated in the blood of vCJD patients. However, its origin and distribution in this biological fluid are still unknown. Various studies have identified cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) among the protein cargo in human blood-circulating extracellular vesicles released from endothelial cells and platelets, and exosomes isolated from the conditioned media of TSE-infected cells have caused the disease when injected into experimental mice. In this study, we demonstrate the detection of PrP(TSE) in extracellular vesicles isolated from plasma samples collected during the preclinical and clinical phases of the disease from mice infected with mouse-adapted vCJD and confirm the presence of the exosomal marker Hsp70 in these preparations.

Biol Reprod	2014	During pregnancy, human placenta-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from the miRNA cluster in human chromosome 19 are expressed in villous trophoblasts and secreted into maternal circulation via exosomes; however, little is known about whether circulating placenta-associated miRNAs are transferred into maternal immune cells via exosomes, and modulate expression of target genes in the recipient cells. We employed an in vitro model of trophoblast-immune cell communication using BeWo cells (a human trophoblast cell line) and Jurkat cells (a human leukemic T-cell line) and investigated whether BeWo exosomal placenta-associated miRNAs can suppress expression of target genes in the recipient Jurkat cells. Using this system, we identified PRKG1 as a target gene of placenta-associated miRNA miR-517a-3p. Moreover, we demonstrated that BeWo exosomal miR-517a-3p was internalized into Jurkat cells and subsequently suppressed the expression of PRKG1 in recipient Jurkat cells. Furthermore, using peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cells in vivo, we confirmed that circulating miR-517a-3p was delivered into maternal NK cells as it was into Jurkat cells in vitro. Placenta-associated miR-517a-3p was incorporated into maternal NK cells in the third trimester, and it was rapidly cleared after delivery. Expression levels of miR-517a-3p and its target mRNA PRKG1 were inversely correlated in NK cells before and after delivery. These in vitro and in vivo results suggest that exosome-mediated transfer of placenta-associated miRNAs and subsequent modulation of their target genes occur in maternal NK cells. The present study provides novel insight into our understanding of placenta-maternal communication.

Int J Cardiol	2015	BACKGROUND: Exosomes play an important role in intercellular signaling and exert regulatory function by carrying bioactive molecules. This study investigated (1) the cardioprotective capabilities of exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) overexpressing GATA-4 (MSC(GATA-4)) and (2) its underlying regulatory mechanisms for expression of target proteins in recipient cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Exosomes were isolated and purified from MSC(GATA-4) (Exo(GATA-4)) and control MSCs (Exo(Null)). Cell injury was investigated in primary cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (CM) and in the rat heart. Exosomes contributed to increased CM survival, reduced CM apoptosis, and preserved mitochondrial membrane potential in CM cultured under a hypoxic environment. Direct intramyocardial transplantation of exosomes at the border of an ischemic region following ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery significantly restored cardiac contractile function and reduced infarct size. Real-time PCR revealed that several anti-apoptotic miRs were highly expressed in Exo(GATA-4). Rapid internalization of Exo(GATA-4) by CM was documented using time-lapse imaging. Subsequent expression of these miRs, particularly miR-19a was higher in CM and in the myocardium treated with Exo(GATA-4) compared to those treated with Exo(Null). The enhanced protective effects observed in CM were diminished by the inhibition of miR-19a. The expression level of PTEN, a predicted target of miR-19a, was reduced in CM treated with Exo(GATA-4), which resulted in the activation of the Akt and ERK signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Exo(GATA-4) upon transplantation in the damaged tissue mediate protection by releasing multiple miRs responsible for activation of the cell survival signaling pathway.	PMC4382384

Electronic address: .	mkadhim@brookes.ac.uk		The non-targeted effects of radiation are perpetuated by exosomes.	Mutat Res	2015	Exosomes contain cargo material from endosomes, cytosol, plasma membrane and microRNA molecules, they are released by a number of non-cancer and cancer cells into both the extracellular microenvironment and body fluids such as blood plasma. Recently we demonstrated radiation-induced non-targeted effects [NTE: genomic instability (GI) and bystander effects (BE)] are partially mediated by exosomes, particularly the RNA content. However the mechanistic role of exosomes in NTE is yet to be fully understood. The present study used MCF7 cells to characterise the longevity of exosome-induced activity in the progeny of irradiated and unirradiated bystander cells. Exosomes extracted from conditioned media of irradiated and bystander progeny were added to unirradiated cells. Analysis was carried out at 1 and 20/24 population doublings following medium/exosome transfer for DNA/chromosomal damage. Results confirmed exosomes play a significant role in mediating NTE of ionising radiation (IR). This effect was remarkably persistent, observed >20 doublings post-irradiation in the progeny of bystander cells. Additionally, cell progeny undergoing a BE were themselves capable of inducing BE in other cells via exosomes they released. Furthermore we investigated the role of exosome cargo. Culture media from cells exposed to 2 Gy X-rays was subjected to ultracentrifugation and four inoculants prepared, (a) supernatants with exosomes removed, and pellets with (b) exosome proteins denatured, (c) RNA degraded, and (d) a combination of protein-RNA inactivation. These were added to separate populations of unirradiated cells. The BE was partially inhibited when either exosome protein or exosome RNA were inactivated separately, whilst combined RNA-protein inhibition significantly reduced or eliminated the BE. These results demonstrate that exosomes are associated with long-lived signalling of the NTE of IR. Both RNA and protein molecules of exosomes work in a synergistic manner to initiate NTE, spread these effects to naïve cells, and perpetuate GI in the affected cells.

Exosomes from Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells Suppress Carrageenan-Induced Acute Inflammation in Mice.	Inflammation	2015	The primary goal of this study was to examine the effects of human dental pulp stem cell-derived exosomes on the carrageenan-induced acute inflammation in mice. Exosomes were purified by differential ultracentrifugation from the supernatants of stem cells derived from the dental pulp of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) cultivated in serum-free medium. At 1 h post-carrageenan injection, exosomes derived from supernatants of 2 × 10(6) SHEDs were administered by intraplantar injection to BALB/c mice; 30 mg/kg of prednisolone and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Edema was measured at 6, 24, and 48 h after carrageenan injection. For the in vivo imaging experiments, AngioSPARK750, Cat B 750 FAST, and MMPSense 750 FAST were administered into the mouse tail vein 2 h post-carrageenan injection. Fluorescence images were acquired at 6, 24, and 48 h after edema induction by IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system. Exosomes significantly reduced the carrageenan-induced edema at all the time points studied (by 39.5, 41.6, and 25.6% at 6, 24, and 48 h after injection, respectively), to similar levels seen with the positive control (prednisolone). In vivo imaging experiments revealed that, both exosomes and prednisolone suppress activities of cathepsin B and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) at the site of carrageenan-induced acute inflammation, showing more prominent effects of prednisolone at the early stages, while exosomes exerted their suppressive effects gradually and at later time points. Our study demonstrates for the first time that exosomes derived from human dental pulp stem cells suppress carrageenan-induced acute inflammation in mice.

Asian Pac J Cancer Prev	2015	Exosomes, membranous nanovesicles, naturally carry bio-macromolecules or miRNA and play impoetant roles in tumor pathogenesis. Here, we showed that macrophages cell-derived exosomes can function as vehicles to deliver exogenous miR-21 inhibitor into BGC-823 gastric cancer cells. Exosomes loaded with miR-21 inhibitor significantly increased miR-21 levels in BGC-823, but miR-21 inhibitor loaded in exosomes exerted an opposite effect. miRNA transfected with exosomes had less cellular toxicity to host cells compared to conventional transfection methods. The miR-21 inhibitor loaded exosomes promoted the migration ability and reduced apoptosis of BGC-823 gastric cancer cells. These observations indicate that miR-21 acts as a tumor promoter by targeting the PDCD4 gene and preventing apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through inhibition of PDCD4 expression. Furthermore, exosome -mediated miR-21 inhibitor delivery resulted in functionally more efficient inhibition and less cellular toxicity compared to conventional transfection methods. Similar approaches could be useful in modification of target biomolecules in vitro and in vivo. These findings contribute to our understanding of the functions of miR-21 and exosomes as a carrier for therapy of gastric cancer.

Allergy Asthma Immunol Res	2015	PURPOSE: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammatory disorder of the upper airway. Exosomes or extracellular vesicles are nanosized vesicles of endosomal origin released from inflammatory and epithelial cells that have been implicated in allergic diseases. In this study, we characterized the microRNA (miRNA) content of exosomes in AR. METHODS: Extracellular vesicles were isolated from nasal mucus from healthy control subjects (n=10) and patients with severe AR (n=10). Vesicle RNA was analyzed by using a TaqMan microRNA assays Human Panel-Early Access kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) containing probes for 366 human miRNAs, and selected findings were validated with quantitative RT-PCR. Target prediction and pathway analysis for the differentially expressed miRNAs were performed using DIANA-mirPath. RESULTS: Twenty-one vesicle miRNAs were up-regulated and 14 miRNAs were under-regulated significantly (P<0.05) in nasal mucus from AR patients when compared to healthy controls. Bioinformatic analysis by DIANA-mirPath demonstrated that 32 KEGG biological processes were significantly enriched (P<0.05, FDR corrected) among differentially expressed vesicle miRNA signatures. Among them, the B-cell receptor signaling pathway (P=3.709E-09), the natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (P=8.466E-05), the T-cell receptor signaling pathway (P=0.00075), the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway (P=0.00127), the Wnt signaling pathway (P=0.00130), endocytosis (P=0.00440), and salivary secretion (P=0.04660) were the most prominent pathways enriched in quantiles with differential vesicle miRNA patterns. Furthermore, miR-30-5p, miR-199b-3p, miR-874, miR-28-3p, miR-203, and miR-875-5p, involved in B-cell receptor and salivary secretion signaling pathways, were selected for validation using independent samples from 44 AR patients and 20 healthy controls. MiR-30-5p and miR-199b-3p were significantly increased in extracellular vesicles from nasal mucus when compared to healthy controls, while miR-874 and miR-28-3p were significantly down-regulated. In addition, miRNA-203 was significantly increased in AR patients, while miRNA-875-5p was found to be significantly decreased in AR patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that vesicle miRNA may be a regulator for the development of AR.	PMC4509657

Gastric Cancer	2016	BACKGROUND: CD97 knockdown impairs the metastatic capacity of SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells. However, the role of CD97 in the distant lymphatic premetastatic niche formation of gastric cancer remains unknown. METHODS: Exosomes and the soluble fraction were isolated from SGC-L (an SGC-7901-cell-derived highly lymphatic metastatic cell line) and CD97-knockdown (SGC-L/CD97-kd) cells, and were co-cultured with gastric cancer cells. The metastatic capacity of the two cell lines was evaluated in vitro and in a footpad lymph node metastasis mouse model. Premetastatic-niche-formation-related proteins were examined immunohistochemically. RESULTS: CD97 expression was ninefold higher in SGC-L cells than in SGC-7901 cells. In vitro, exosomes or conditioned medium from the SGC-L cells enhanced cell proliferation (20 % increase) and invasion (30 % increase) as compared with that from SGC-L/CD97-kd cells (p < 0.01). Intrafootpad injections of SGC-L, but not SGC-L/CD97-kd exosomes or conditioned medium, strongly promoted SGC-L and SGC-L/CD97-kd cell accumulation in the draining lymph nodes (p < 0.01) and increased CD55, CD44v6, α5β1, CD31, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, and CD151 expression. Although the SGC-L/CD97-kd exosomes alone were insufficient for promotion of metastasis, they were partly aided by the SGC-L-cell-derived soluble fraction. CONCLUSIONS: The CD97 small isoform promotes SGC-L cell lymphatic metastasis exosome dependently, and aided by the soluble fraction, the exosome-dependent CD97 plays a pivotal role in premetastatic niche formation.

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	BACKGROUND: Our group has previously demonstrated that murine whole bone marrow cells (WBM) that internalize lung-derived extracellular vesicles (LDEVs) in culture express pulmonary epithelial cell-specific genes for up to 12 weeks. In addition, the lungs of lethally irradiated mice transplanted with lung vesicle-modulated marrow have 5 times more WBM-derived type II pneumocytes compared to mice transplanted with unmanipulated WBM. These findings indicate that extracellular vesicle modification may be an important consideration in the development of marrow cell-based cellular therapies. Current studies were performed to determine the specific marrow cell types that LDEV stably modify. METHODS: Murine WBM-derived stem/progenitor cells (Lin-/Sca-1+) and differentiated erythroid cells (Ter119+), granulocytes (Gr-1+) and B cells (CD19+) were cultured with carboxyfluorescein N-succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labelled LDEV. LDEV+ cells (CFSE+) and LDEV- cells (CFSE-) were separated by flow cytometry and visualized by fluorescence microscopy, analyzed by RT-PCR or placed into long-term secondary culture. In addition, murine Lin-/Sca-1+ cells were cultured with CFSE-labelled LDEV isolated from rats, and RT-PCR analysis was performed on LDEV+ and - cells using species-specific primers for surfactant (rat/mouse hybrid co-cultures). RESULTS: Stem/progenitor cells and all of the differentiated cell types studied internalized LDEV in culture, but heterogeneously. Expression of a panel of pulmonary epithelial cell genes was higher in LDEV+cells compared to LDEV - cells and elevated expression of these genes persisted in long-term culture. Rat/mouse hybrid co-cultures revealed only mouse-specific surfactant B and C expression in LDEV+ Lin-/Sca-1+cells after 4 weeks of culture, indicating stable de novo gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: LDEV can be internalized by differentiated and more primitive cells residing in the bone marrow in culture and can induce stable de novo pulmonary epithelial cell gene expression in these cells for several weeks after internalization. The gene expression represents a transcriptional activation of the target marrow cells. These studies serve as the basis for determining marrow cell types that can be used for cell-based therapies for processes that injure the pulmonary epithelial surfaces.	PMC4575417

Noninvasive imaging of radiolabeled exosome-mimetic nanovesicle using (99m)Tc-HMPAO.	Sci Rep	2015	Exosomes known as nano-sized extracellular vesicles attracted recent interests due to their potential usefulness in drug delivery. Amid remarkable advances in biomedical applications of exosomes, it is crucial to understand in vivo distribution and behavior of exosomes. Here, we developed a simple method for radiolabeling of macrophage-derived exosome-mimetic nanovesicles (ENVs) with (99m)Tc-HMPAO under physiologic conditions and monitored in vivo distribution of (99m)Tc-HMPAO-ENVs using SPECT/CT in living mice. ENVs were produced from the mouse RAW264.7 macrophage cell line and labeled with (99m)Tc-HMPAO for 1 hr incubation, followed by removal of free (99m)Tc-HMPAO. SPECT/CT images were serially acquired after intravenous injection to BALB/c mouse. When ENVs were labeled with (99m)Tc-HMPAO, the radiochemical purity of (99m)Tc-HMPAO-ENVs was higher than 90% and the expression of exosome specific protein (CD63) did not change in (99m)Tc-HMPAO-ENVs. (99m)Tc-HMPAO-ENVs showed high serum stability (90%) which was similar to that in phosphate buffered saline until 5 hr. SPECT/CT images of the mice injected with (99m)Tc-HMPAO-ENVs exhibited higher uptake in liver and no uptake in brain, whereas mice injected with (99m)Tc-HMPAO showed high brain uptake until 5 hr. Our noninvasive imaging of radiolabeled-ENVs promises better understanding of the in vivo behavior of exosomes for upcoming biomedical application.	PMC4620485

J Lipid Res	2016	Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a lipotoxic disease wherein activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and macrophage-mediated hepatic inflammation are key pathogenic features. However, the lipid mediators linking these two observations remain elusive. We postulated that ER stress-regulated release of pro-inflammatory extracellular vesicles (EVs) from lipotoxic hepatocytes may be this link. EVs were isolated from cell culture supernatants of hepatocytes treated with palmitate (PA) to induce lipotoxic ER stress, characterized by immunofluorescence, Western blotting, electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Sphingolipids were measured by tandem mass spectrometry. EVs were employed in macrophage chemotaxis assays. PA induced significant EV release. Because PA activates ER stress, we used KO hepatocytes to demonstrate that PA-induced EV release was mediated by inositol requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α)/X-box binding protein-1. PA-induced EVs were enriched in C16:0 ceramide in an IRE1α-dependent manner, and activated macrophage chemotaxis via formation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) from C16:0 ceramide. This chemotaxis was blocked by sphingosine kinase inhibitors and S1P receptor inhibitors. Lastly, elevated circulating EVs in experimental and human NASH demonstrated increased C16:0 ceramide. PA induces C16:0 ceramide-enriched EV release in an IRE1α-dependent manner. The ceramide metabolite, S1P, activates macrophage chemotaxis, a potential mechanism for the recruitment of macrophages to the liver under lipotoxic conditions.	PMC4727419

Exosomal transfer of functional small RNAs mediates cancer-stroma communication in human endometrium.	Cancer Med	2016	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles secreted from a variety of cell types. Recent evidence indicates that human cells communicate with each other by exchanging exosomes. Cancer cells closely interact with neighboring stromal cells, and together they cooperatively promote disease via bidirectional communication. Here, we investigated whether exosomes can play roles in intercellular communication between cancer cells and neighboring fibroblasts. Endometrial fibroblasts were isolated from normal endometrial tissues and from endometrial cancer tissues, and cell-to-cell transfer of endometrial cancer cell line Ishikawa-derived exosomes was examined. The isolated fibroblasts were cultured in conditioned media from CD63-GFP-expressing Ishikawa cells, and we found that GFP-positive exosomes were transferred from Ishikawa cells to the fibroblasts. Next, we introduced a shRNA for a luciferase gene into Ishikawa cells. This shRNA was encapsulated into exosomes, was transferred to the fibroblasts, and then downregulated luciferase expression in the fibroblasts. The mature microRNAs naturally expressed in Ishikawa-derived exosomes were also transported into the endometrial fibroblasts, and they altered the microRNA expression profiles of the fibroblasts. These results indicated that endometrial cancer cells could transmit small regulatory RNAs to endometrial fibroblasts via exosomes. Our findings document a previously unknown mode of intercellular communication between cancer cells and related fibroblasts in human endometrium.	PMC4735775
26819476	Thomas E Spencer	Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri .	spencerte@missouri.edu		Extracellular Vesicles Originate from the Conceptus and Uterus During Early Pregnancy in Sheep.	Biol Reprod	2016	Cells release diverse types of membrane-bound vesicles of endosomal and plasma membrane origin, termed exosomes and microvesicles, respectively. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent an important mode of intercellular communication by transferring select RNAs, proteins, and lipids between cells. The present studies tested the hypothesis that the elongating ovine conceptus and uterus produces EVs that mediate conceptus-maternal interactions during early pregnancy. In Study 1, EVs were purified from uterine luminal fluid of Day 14 cyclic sheep. The EVs were fluorescently labeled with PKH67 dye and infused into the uterine lumen of pregnant sheep for 6 days using an osmotic pump. On Day 14, labeled EVs were observed in the conceptus trophectoderm and uterine epithelia, but not in the uterine stroma or myometrium. In Study 2, Day 14 conceptuses were cultured ex vivo for 24 h and found to release EVs into the culture medium. Proteomics analysis of the Day 14 conceptus-derived EVs identified 231 proteins that were enriched for extracellular space and several protein classes, including proteases, protease inhibitors, chaperones and chaperonins. RNA sequencing of Day 14 conceptus-derived EVs detected expression of 512 mRNAs. The top-expressed genes were overrepresented in ribosomal functions and components. Isolated EVs from conceptuses were fluorescently labeled with PKH67 and infused into the uterine lumen of cyclic sheep for 6 days using an osmotic pump. On Day 14, labeled EVs were observed in the uterine epithelia, but not in the uterine stroma or myometrium. Labeled EVs were not observed in the ovary or in other maternal tissues. These studies support the ideas that EVs emanate from both the conceptus trophectoderm and uterine epithelia, and are involved in intercellular communication between those cells during the establishment of pregnancy in sheep.

Transfer of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator to Human Cystic Fibrosis Cells Mediated by Extracellular Vesicles.	Hum Gene Ther	2016	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, resulting in a deficiency in chloride channel activity. In this study, extracellular vesicles (EVs), microvesicles, and exosomes were used as vehicles to deliver exogenous CFTR glycoprotein and its encoding mRNA (mRNA(GFP-CFTR)) to CF cells to correct the CFTR chloride channel function. We isolated microvesicles and exosomes from the culture medium of CFTR-positive Calu-3 cells, or from A549 cells transduced with an adenoviral vector overexpressing a GFP-tagged CFTR (GFP-CFTR). Both microvesicles and exosomes had the capacity to package and deliver the GFP-CFTR glycoprotein and mRNA(GFP-CFTR) to target cells in a dose-dependent manner. Homologous versus heterologous EV-to-cell transfer was studied, and it appeared that the cellular uptake of EVs was significantly more efficient in homologous transfer. The incubation of CF15 cells, a nasal epithelial cell line homozygous for the ΔF508 CFTR mutation, with microvesicles or exosomes loaded with GFP-CFTR resulted in the correction of the CFTR function in CF cells in a dose-dependent manner. A time-course analysis of EV-transduced CF cells suggested that CFTR transferred as mature glycoprotein was responsible for the CFTR-associated channel activity detected at early times posttransduction, whereas GFP-CFTR translated from exogenous mRNA(GFP-CFTR) was responsible for the CFTR function at later times. Collectively, this study showed the potential application of microvesicles and exosomes as vectors for CFTR transfer and functional correction of the genetic defect in human CF cells.

Improvement of neuronal cell survival by astrocyte-derived exosomes under hypoxic and ischemic conditions depends on prion protein.	Glia	2016	Prion protein (PrP) protects neural cells against oxidative stress, hypoxia, ischemia, and hypoglycemia. In the present study we confirm that cultured PrP-deficient neurons are more sensitive to oxidative stress than wild-type neurons and present the novel findings that wild-type, but not PrP-deficient astrocytes protect wild-type cerebellar neurons against oxidative stress and that exosomes released from stressed wild-type, but not from stressed PrP-deficient astrocytes reduce neuronal cell death induced by oxidative stress. We show that neuroprotection by exosomes of stressed astrocytes depends on exosomal PrP but not on neuronal PrP and that astrocyte-derived exosomal PrP enters into neurons, suggesting neuronal uptake of astrocyte-derived exosomes. Upon exposure of wild-type astrocytes to hypoxic or ischemic conditions PrP levels in exosomes were increased. By mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis, we detected increased levels of 37/67 kDa laminin receptor, apolipoprotein E and the ribosomal proteins S3 and P0, and decreased levels of clusterin/apolipoprotein J in exosomes from wild-type astrocytes exposed to oxygen/glucose deprivation relative to exosomes from astrocytes maintained under normoxic conditions. The levels of these proteins were not altered in exosomes from stressed PrP-deficient astrocytes relative to unstressed PrP-deficient astrocytes. These results indicate that PrP in astrocytes is a sensor for oxidative stress and mediates beneficial cellular responses, e.g. release of exosomes carrying PrP and other molecules, resulting in improved survival of neurons under hypoxic and ischemic conditions.

Sci Rep	2016	It is well documented that cells secrete exosomes, which can transfer biomolecules that impact recipient cells' functionality in a variety of physiologic and disease processes. The role of lymphatic drainage and transport of exosomes is as yet unknown, although the lymphatics play critical roles in immunity and exosomes are in the ideal size-range for lymphatic transport. Through in vivo near-infrared (NIR) imaging we have shown that exosomes are rapidly transported within minutes from the periphery to the lymph node by lymphatics. Using an in vitro model of lymphatic uptake, we have shown that lymphatic endothelial cells actively enhanced lymphatic uptake and transport of exosomes to the luminal side of the vessel. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a differential distribution of exosomes in the draining lymph nodes that is dependent on the lymphatic flow. Lastly, through endpoint analysis of cellular distribution of exosomes in the node, we identified macrophages and B-cells as key players in exosome uptake. Together these results suggest that exosome transfer by lymphatic flow from the periphery to the lymph node could provide a mechanism for rapid exchange of infection-specific information that precedes the arrival of migrating cells, thus priming the node for a more effective immune response.

Circulating Plasma Extracellular Microvesicle MicroRNA Cargo and Endothelial Dysfunction in Children with Obstructive Sleep Apnea.	Am J Respir Crit Care Med	2016	RATIONALE: Obese children are at increased risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and both of these conditions are associated with an increased risk for endothelial dysfunction (ED) in children, an early risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Although weight loss and treatment of OSA by adenotonsillectomy improve endothelial function, not every obese child or child with OSA develops ED. Exosomes are circulating extracellular vesicles containing functional mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) that can be delivered to other cells, such as endothelial cells. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether circulating exosomal miRNAs of children with OSA differentiate based on endothelial functional status. METHODS: Obese children (body mass index z score >1.65) and nonobese children were recruited and underwent polysomnographic testing (PSG), and fasting endothelial function measurements and blood draws in the morning after PSG. Plasma exosomes were isolated from all subjects. Isolated exosomes were then incubated with confluent endothelial cell monolayer cultures. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing systems were used to determine the ability of exosomes to disrupt the intercellular barrier formed by confluent endothelial cells. In addition, immunofluorescent assessments of zonula occludens-1 tight junction protein cellular distribution were conducted to examine endothelial barrier dysfunction. miRNA and mRNA arrays were also applied to exosomes and endothelial cells, and miRNA inhibitors and mimics were transfected for mechanistic assays. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Plasma exosomes isolated from either obese children or nonobese children with OSA were primarily derived from endothelial cell sources and recapitulated ED, or its absence, in naive human endothelial cells and also in vivo when injected into mice. Microarrays identified a restricted signature of exosomal miRNAs that readily distinguished ED from normal endothelial function. Among the miRNAs, expression of exosomal miRNA-630 was reduced in children with ED and normalized after therapy along with restoration of endothelial function. Conversely, transfection of exosomes from subjects without ED with an miRNA-630 inhibitor induces the ED functional phenotype. Gene target discovery experiments further revealed that miRNA-630 regulates 416 gene targets in endothelial cells that include the Nrf2, AMP kinase, and tight junction pathways. CONCLUSIONS: These observations elucidate a novel role of exosomal miRNA-360 as a putative key mediator of vascular function and cardiovascular disease risk in children with underlying OSA and/or obesity, and identify therapeutic targets.

J Cell Biochem	2017	It is well known that Src tyrosine kinase, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) play important roles in prostate cancer (PrCa) development and progression. Src, which signals through FAK in response to integrin activation, has been implicated in many aspects of tumor biology, such as cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, Src signaling is known to crosstalk with IGF-IR, which also promotes angiogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that c-Src, IGF-IR, and FAK are packaged into exosomes (Exo), c-Src in particular being highly enriched in Exo from the androgen receptor (AR)-positive cell line C4-2B and AR-negative cell lines PC3 and DU145. Furthermore, we show that the active phosphorylated form of Src (SrcpY416 ) is co-expressed in Exo with phosphorylated FAK (FAKpY861 ), a known target site of Src, which enhances proliferation and migration. We further demonstrate for the first time exosomal enrichment of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 5 and GRK6, both of which regulate Src and IGF-IR signaling and have been implicated in cancer. Finally, SrcpY416 and c-Src are both expressed in Exo isolated from the plasma of prostate tumor-bearing TRAMP mice, and those same mice have higher levels of exosomal c-Src than their wild-type counterparts. In summary, we provide new evidence that active signaling molecules relevant to PrCa are enriched in Exo, and this suggests that the Src signaling network may provide useful biomarkers detectable by liquid biopsy, and may contribute to PrCa progression via Exo.

Cardiac progenitor cell-derived exosomes prevent cardiomyocytes apoptosis through exosomal miR-21 by targeting PDCD4.	Cell Death Dis	2016	Cardiac progenitor cells derived from adult heart have emerged as one of the most promising stem cell types for cardiac protection and repair. Exosomes are known to mediate cell-cell communication by transporting cell-derived proteins and nucleic acids, including various microRNAs (miRNAs). Here we investigated the cardiac progenitor cell (CPC)-derived exosomal miRNAs on protecting myocardium under oxidative stress. Sca1(+)CPCs-derived exosomes were purified from conditional medium, and identified by nanoparticle trafficking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy and western blotting using CD63, CD9 and Alix as markers. Exosomes production was measured by NTA, the result showed that oxidative stress-induced CPCs secrete more exosomes compared with normal condition. Although six apoptosis-related miRNAs could be detected in two different treatment-derived exosomes, only miR-21 was significantly upregulated in oxidative stress-induced exosomes compared with normal exosomes. The same oxidative stress could cause low miR-21 and high cleaved caspase-3 expression in H9C2 cardiac cells. But the cleaved caspase-3 was significantly decreased when miR-21 was overexpressed by transfecting miR-21 mimic. Furthermore, miR-21 mimic or inhibitor transfection and luciferase activity assay confirmed that programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) was a target gene of miR-21, and miR-21/PDCD4 axis has an important role in anti-apoptotic effect of H9C2 cell. Western blotting and Annexin V/PI results demonstrated that exosomes pre-treated H9C2 exhibited increased miR-21 whereas decreased PDCD4, and had more resistant potential to the apoptosis induced by the oxidative stress, compared with non-treated cells. These findings revealed that CPC-derived exosomal miR-21 had an inhibiting role in the apoptosis pathway through downregulating PDCD4. Restored miR-21/PDCD4 pathway using CPC-derived exosomes could protect myocardial cells against oxidative stress-related apoptosis. Therefore, exosomes could be used as a new therapeutic vehicle for ischemic cardiac disease.	PMC5143405

Mol Cancer Res	2016	The αvβ3 integrin is known to be highly upregulated during cancer progression and promotes a migratory and metastatic phenotype in many types of tumors. We hypothesized that the αvβ3 integrin is transferred through exosomes and, upon transfer, has the ability to support functional aberrations in recipient cells. Here, for the first time, it is demonstrated that αvβ3 is present in exosomes released from metastatic PC3 and CWR22Pc prostate cancer cells. Exosomal β3 is transferred as a protein from donor to nontumorigenic and tumorigenic cells as β3 protein or mRNA levels remain unaffected upon transcription or translation inhibition in recipient cells. Furthermore, it is shown that upon exosome uptake, de novo expression of an αvβ3 increases adhesion and migration of recipient cells on an αvβ3 ligand, vitronectin. To evaluate the relevance of these findings, exosomes were purified from the blood of TRAMP mice carrying tumors where the expression of αvβ3 is found higher than in exosomes from wild-type mice. In addition, it is demonstrated that αvβ3 is coexpressed with synaptophysin, a biomarker for aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer. IMPLICATIONS: Overall this study reveals that the αvβ3 integrin is transferred from tumorigenic to nontumorigenic cells via exosomes, and its de novo expression in recipient cells promotes cell migration on its ligand. The increased expression of αvβ3 in exosomes from mice bearing tumors points to its clinical relevance and potential use as a biomarker. Mol Cancer Res; 14(11); 1136-46. ©2016 AACR.	PMC5107121

PGE2 /EP4 Signaling Controls the Transfer of the Mammary Stem Cell State by Lipid Rafts in Extracellular Vesicles.	Stem Cells	2017	Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 )-initiated signaling contributes to stem cell homeostasis and regeneration. However, it is unclear how PGE2 signaling controls cell stemness. This study identifies a previously unknown mechanism by which PGE2 /prostaglandin E receptor 4 (EP4 ) signaling regulates multiple signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K/Akt signaling, TGFβ signaling, Wnt signaling, EGFR signaling) which maintain the basal mammary stem cell phenotype. A shift of basal mammary epithelial stem cells (MaSCs) from a mesenchymal/stem cell state to a non-basal-MaSC state occurs in response to prostaglandin E receptor 4 (EP4 ) antagonism. EP4 antagonists elicit release of signaling components, by controlling their trafficking into extracellular vesicles/exosomes in a lipid raft/caveolae-dependent manner. Consequently, EP4 antagonism indirectly inactivates, through induced extracellular vesicle/exosome release, pathways required for mammary epithelial stem cell homeostasis, e.g. canonical/noncanonical Wnt, TGFβ and PI3K/Akt pathways. EP4 antagonism causes signaling receptors and signaling components to shift from non-lipid raft fractions to lipid raft fractions, and to then be released in EP4 antagonist-induced extracellular vesicles/exosomes, resulting in the loss of the stem cell state by mammary epithelial stem cells. In contrast, luminal mammary epithelial cells can acquire basal stem cell properties following ingestion of EP4 antagonist-induced stem cell extracellular vesicles/exosomes, and can then form mammary glands. These findings demonstrate that PGE2 /EP4 signaling controls homeostasis of mammary epithelial stem cells through regulating extracellular vesicle/exosome release. Reprogramming of mammary epithelial cells can result from EP4 -mediated stem cell property transfer by extracellular vesicles/exosomes containing caveolae-associated proteins, between mammary basal and luminal epithelial cells.

EMBO Mol Med	2016	Here, we identified release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by the choroid plexus epithelium (CPE) as a new mechanism of blood-brain communication. Systemic inflammation induced an increase in EVs and associated pro-inflammatory miRNAs, including miR-146a and miR-155, in the CSF Interestingly, this was associated with an increase in amount of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and exosomes per MVB in the CPE cells. Additionally, we could mimic this using LPS-stimulated primary CPE cells and choroid plexus explants. These choroid plexus-derived EVs can enter the brain parenchyma and are taken up by astrocytes and microglia, inducing miRNA target repression and inflammatory gene up-regulation. Interestingly, this could be blocked in vivo by intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of an inhibitor of exosome production. Our data show that CPE cells sense and transmit information about the peripheral inflammatory status to the central nervous system (CNS) via the release of EVs into the CSF, which transfer this pro-inflammatory message to recipient brain cells. Additionally, we revealed that blockage of EV secretion decreases brain inflammation, which opens up new avenues to treat systemic inflammatory diseases such as sepsis.	PMC5048366

J Exp Med	2016	Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with a T helper 17 response. Yet, it has proved challenging to identify relevant peptide-based T cell antigens. Antigen-presenting Langerhans cells show a differential migration phenotype in psoriatic lesions and express constitutively high levels of CD1a, which presents lipid antigens to T cells. In addition, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is highly expressed in psoriatic lesions and is known to generate neolipid skin antigens for recognition by CD1a-reactive T cells. In this study, we observed expression of a cytoplasmic PLA2 (PLA2G4D) in psoriatic mast cells but, unexpectedly, also found PLA2G4D activity to be extracellular. This was explained by IFN-α-induced mast cell release of exosomes, which transferred cytoplasmic PLA2 activity to neighboring CD1a-expressing cells. This led to the generation of neolipid antigens and subsequent recognition by lipid-specific CD1a-reactive T cells inducing production of IL-22 and IL-17A. Circulating and skin-derived T cells from patients with psoriasis showed elevated PLA2G4D responsiveness compared with healthy controls. Overall, these data present an alternative model of psoriasis pathogenesis in which lipid-specific CD1a-reactive T cells contribute to psoriatic inflammation. The findings suggest that PLA2 inhibition or CD1a blockade may have therapeutic potential for psoriasis.	PMC5068234

Here, we report our investigation of the cargo of placental EVs, focusing on the composition and the antiviral properties of exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic blebs. METHODS: We isolated EVs using ultracentrifugation and defined their purity using immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking. We used liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, protein mass spectrometry, and miRNA TaqMan card PCR to examine the phospholipids, proteins, and miRNA cargo of trophoblastic EVs and an in vitro viral infection assay to assess the antiviral properties of EVs. RESULTS: We found that all three EV types contain a comparable repertoire of miRNA. Interestingly, trophoblastic exosomes harbor a protein and phospholipid profile that is distinct from that of microvesicles or apoptotic blebs. Functionally, trophoblastic exosomes exhibit the highest antiviral activity among the EVs. Consistently, plasma exosomes derived from pregnant women recapitulate the antiviral effect of trophoblastic exosomes derived from in vitro cultures of primary human trophoblasts. DISCUSSION: When compared to other trophoblastic EVs, exosomes exhibit a unique repertoire of proteins and phospholipids, but not miRNAs, and a potent viral activity. Our work suggests that human trophoblastic EVs may play a key role in maternal-placental-fetal communication.	PMC5123854

Methods Mol Biol	2017	Exosomes are diverse bioactive extracellular nanovesicles excreted by different cell types. These tiny membrane-bound vesicles, once thought to be functionally insignificant, are now believed to be important vehicles for transport and intercellular communication. Exosomes have been shown to contain a broad range of molecules, from miRNAs to proteins to soluble factors. Moreover, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that some viruses can hijack the exosomal excretory pathway to influence the microenvironment surrounding the infected cells. In this chapter, we describe the protocols we use to examine the impact of exosomes isolated from EBV-infected cells on different cell types.

Cancer Lett	2017	The human EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL), obtained by infecting peripheral blood monocular cells with Epstein-Barr Virus, has been extensively used for human genetic, pharmacogenomic, and immunologic studies. Recently, the role of exosomes has also been indicated as crucial in the crosstalk between EBV and the host microenvironment. Because the role that the LCL and LCL exosomal cargo might play in maintaining persistent infection, and since little is known regarding the non-coding RNAs of LCL, the aim of our work was the comprehensive characterization of this class of RNA, cellular and viral miRNAs, and cellular lncRNAs, in LCL compared with PBMC derived from the same donors. In this study, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that all the viral miRNAs expressed by LCL are also packaged in the exosomes, and we found that two miRNAs, ebv-miR-BART3 and ebv-miR-BHRF1-1, are more abundant in the exosomes, suggesting a microvescicular viral microRNA transfer. In addition, lncRNA profiling revealed that LCLs were enriched in lncRNA H19 and H19 antisense, and released these through exosomes, suggesting a leading role in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment.

Reprogramming Malignant Cancer Cells toward a Benign Phenotype following Exposure to Human Embryonic Stem Cell Microenvironment.	PLoS One	2017	The embryonic microenvironment is well known to be non-permissive for tumor development because early developmental signals naturally suppress the expression of proto-oncogenes. In an analogous manner, mimicking an early embryonic environment during embryonic stem cell culture has been shown to suppress oncogenic phenotypes of cancer cells. Exosomes derived from human embryonic stem cells harbor substances that mirror the content of the cells of origin and have been reported to reprogram hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells via horizontal transfer of mRNA and proteins. However, the possibility that these embryonic stem cells-derived exosomes might be the main effectors of the anti-tumor effect mediated by the embryonic stem cells has not been explored yet. The present study aims to investigate whether exosomes derived from human embryonic stem cells can reprogram malignant cancer cells to a benign stage and reduce their tumorigenicity. We show that the embryonic stem cell-conditioned medium contains factors that inhibit cancer cell growth and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that exosomes derived from human embryonic stem cells display anti-proliferation and pro-apoptotic effects, and decrease tumor size in a xenograft model. These exosomes are also able to transfer their cargo into target cancer cells, inducing a dose-dependent increase in SOX2, OCT4 and Nanog proteins, leading to a dose-dependent decrease of cancer cell growth and tumorigenicity. This study shows for the first time that human embryonic stem cell-derived exosomes play an important role in the tumor suppressive activity displayed by human embryonic stem cells.	PMC5222525

Exosome-Based Delivery of miR-124 in a Huntington's Disease Model.	J Mov Disord	2017	OBJECTIVE: Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease that is caused by abnormal CAG expansion. Altered microRNA (miRNA) expression also causes abnormal gene regulation in this neurodegenerative disease. The delivery of abnormally downregulated miRNAs might restore normal gene regulation and have a therapeutic effect. METHODS: We developed an exosome-based delivery method to treat this neurodegenerative disease. miR-124, one of the key miRNAs that is repressed in HD, was stably overexpressed in a stable cell line. Exosomes were then harvested from these cells using an optimized protocol. The exosomes (Exo-124) exhibited a high level of miR-124 expression and were taken up by recipient cells. RESULTS: When Exo-124 was injected into the striatum of R6/2 transgenic HD mice, expression of the target gene, RE1-Silencing Transcription Factor, was reduced. However, Exo-124 treatment did not produce significant behavioral improvement. CONCLUSION: This study serves as a proof of concept for exosome-based delivery of miRNA in neurodegenerative diseases.

Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells-Derived Exosomes Promote Survival of Retinal Ganglion Cells Through miRNA-Dependent Mechanisms.	Stem Cells Transl Med	2017	The loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and their axons is one of the leading causes of blindness and includes traumatic (optic neuropathy) and degenerative (glaucoma) eye diseases. Although no clinical therapies are in use, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have demonstrated significant neuroprotective and axogenic effects on RGC in both of the aforementioned models. Recent evidence has shown that MSC secrete exosomes, membrane enclosed vesicles (30-100 nm) containing proteins, mRNA and miRNA which can be delivered to nearby cells. The present study aimed to isolate exosomes from bone marrow-derived MSC (BMSC) and test them in a rat optic nerve crush (ONC) model. Treatment of primary retinal cultures with BMSC-exosomes demonstrated significant neuroprotective and neuritogenic effects. Twenty-one days after ONC and weekly intravitreal exosome injections; optical coherence tomography, electroretinography, and immunohistochemistry was performed. BMSC-derived exosomes promoted statistically significant survival of RGC and regeneration of their axons while partially preventing RGC axonal loss and RGC dysfunction. Exosomes successfully delivered their cargo into inner retinal layers and the effects were reliant on miRNA, demonstrated by the diminished therapeutic effects of exosomes derived from BMSC after knockdown of Argonaute-2, a key miRNA effector molecule. This study supports the use of BMSC-derived exosomes as a cell-free therapy for traumatic and degenerative ocular disease. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2017;6:1273-1285.	PMC5442835

Mol Ther	2017	Exosomes are small membrane-bound vesicular particles generated by most cells for intercellular communication and regulation. During biogenesis, specific lipids, RNAs, proteins, and carbohydrates are enriched and packaged into the vesicles so that the exosomal contents reflect not only the source but also the physiological conditions of the parental cells. These exosomes transport materials or signals to the target cells for diverse physiological purposes. Our study focused on the exosomes derived from M1-polarized, proinflammatory macrophages for the possibility of using M1 exosomes as an immunopotentiator for a cancer vaccine. The M1 exosomes displayed a tropism toward lymph nodes after subcutaneous injection, primarily taken up by the local macrophages and dendritic cells, and they induced the release of a pool of Th1 cytokines. We found that M1, but not M2, exosomes enhanced activity of lipid calcium phosphate (LCP) nanoparticle-encapsulated Trp2 vaccine, and they induced a stronger antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell response. The M1 exosomes proved to be a more potent immunopotentiator than CpG oligonucleotide when used with LCP nanoparticle vaccine in a melanoma growth inhibition study. Thus, our study indicated that exosomes derived from M1-polarized macrophages could be used as a vaccine adjuvant.	PMC5498801

Circulating osteocyte-derived exosomes contain miRNAs which are enriched in exosomes from MLO-Y4 cells.	Biomed Rep	2017	Signaling molecules produced by osteocytes have been proposed to serve as soluble factors that contribute to bone remodeling, as well as to homeostasis of other organs. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are currently no studies investigating the role of osteocyte-secreted exosomes. In the present study, ablation of osteocytes in mice [osteocyte-less (OL)] was used to examine the microRNA (miRNA) levels of plasma-circulating exosomes. In order to investigate the function of osteocyte-secreted exosomes, exosomes derived from MLO-Y4 cells were extracted and their miRNA expression levels were examined using miRNA array analysis and deep sequencing. Comparison of miRNA expression levels between plasma exosomes from OL mouse plasma and MLO-Y4-derived exosomes revealed that decreases in the number of miRNAs from exosomes circulating in the OL mouse plasma may be caused by a decrease in secretion of exosomes from osteocytes. These results suggest that osteocytes secrete exosomes containing characterized miRNAs and then circulate in the blood, and may thus transfer their components, including miRNAs, to recipient cells where they function as signaling molecules in other organs and/or tissues to regulate biological responses.

RNA in Salivary Extracellular Vesicles as a Possible Tool for Systemic Disease Diagnosis.	J Dent Res	2017	Saliva contains biological information as blood and is recognized as a valuable diagnostic medium for their noninvasiveness. Although "-omics" researches have tried to investigate saliva, the origin and significance of its contents are not clear, and its usage is largely confined to oral disease in the diagnostic and prognostic field. In an attempt to broaden the applicability of saliva and to find systemic disease-derived RNA in saliva, we made mouse models that had human melanoma and isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from their saliva by an aqueous 2-phase system (ATPS), then identified and evaluated their expression of human melan-A RNA, which is associated with melanoma on skin. With ATPS, EVs were isolated efficiently and stably while taking less time compared to isolation by ultracentrifugation. When ATPS was used to isolate EVs from saliva, the mean ± SD percentage of EVs recovered from initial EVs was 38.22% ± 18.55% by the number of particles, and the mean ± SD percentage of RNA recovered from the initial amount was 60.33% ± 5.34%. RNAs within isolated EVs were analyzed subsequently by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and polymerase chain reaction from saliva and plasma. In melanoma mice, amplification of human melan-A was identified from saliva and plasma, even though a relative amount of normalized melan-A was lower than that of plasma. These results present a possibility that RNAs derived from systemic disease are transferred into saliva from blood in EVs. Also, they suggest that saliva could be exploited in obtaining information about systemic disease, not only about oral disease, by examining RNAs in EVs from saliva instead of blood.

Arch Virol	2017	Intact HIV-1 and exosomes can be internalized by dendritic cells (DCs) through a common pathway leading to their transmission to CD4+ T lymphocytes by means of mechanisms defined as trans-infection and trans-dissemination, respectively. We previously reported that exosomes from HIV-1-infected cells activate both uninfected quiescent CD4+ T lymphocytes, which become permissive to HIV-1, and latently infected cells, with release of HIV-1 particles. However, nothing is known about the effects of trans-dissemination of exosomes produced by HIV-1-infected cells on uninfected or latently HIV-1-infected CD4+ T lymphocytes. Here, we report that trans-dissemination of exosomes from HIV-1-infected cells induces cell activation in resting CD4+ T lymphocytes, which appears stronger with mature than immature DCs. Using purified preparations of both HIV-1 and exosomes, we observed that mDC-mediated trans-dissemination of exosomes from HIV-1-infected cells to resting CD4+ T lymphocytes induces efficient trans-infection and HIV-1 expression in target cells. Most relevant, when both mDCs and CD4+ T lymphocytes were isolated from combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-treated HIV-1-infected patients, trans-dissemination of exosomes from HIV-1-infected cells led to HIV-1 reactivation from the viral reservoir. In sum, our data suggest a role of exosome trans-dissemination in both HIV-1 spread in the infected host and reactivation of the HIV-1 reservoir.

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2017	Orally administered Lactobacillus strains, including L. plantarum No.14 and L. rhamnosus GG, reportedly reduce inflammatory cytokine production in mice. The present study tested our idea that circulating exosomes mediate the action of Lactobacillus strains. The lipopolysaccharide-induced production of TNF-α and IL-6 in vitro was attenuated in peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) isolated from C57BL/6N mice that had been fed L. plantarum No.14. When PECs were cultured for 24 h with exosomes isolated from the serum of mice fed L. plantarum No.14 or L. rhamnosus GG, accumulation of both TNF-α and of the corresponding mRNA was lowered. Growth in the presence of these exosomes also decreased the production of TNF-α and IL-6 by the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. In contrast, supplementation with exosome-depleted serum of mice fed L. plantarum No.14 or L. rhamnosus GG failed to affect the production of TNF-α and IL-6 by RAW264.7 cells. When PECs and RAW264.7 cells were cultured for 24 h with PKH67-labeled exosomes isolated from murine serum, fluorescent signal was observed inside the cells, suggesting that these cells incorporate serum exosomes. We propose that the anti-inflammatory activity of orally administered L. plantarum No.14 and L. rhamnosus GG is mediated, at least in part, by circulating exosomes.

Labeling and Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Exosomes Isolated from Adipose Stem Cells.	Curr Protoc Cell Biol	2017	Adipose stem cells (ASC) represent a promising therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. Most biological effects of ASC are probably mediated by extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, which influence the surrounding cells. Current development of exosome therapies requires efficient and noninvasive methods to localize, monitor, and track the exosomes. Among imaging methods used for this purpose, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has advantages: high spatial resolution, rapid in vivo acquisition, and radiation-free operation. To be detectable with MRI, exosomes must be labeled with MR contrast agents, such as ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO). Here, we set up an innovative approach for exosome labeling that preserves their morphology and physiological characteristics. We show that by labeling ASC with USPIO before extraction of nanovesicles, the isolated exosomes retain nanoparticles and can be visualized by MRI. The current work aims at validating this novel USPIO-based exosome labeling method by monitoring the efficiency of the labeling with MRI both in ASC and in exosomes. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci	2017	OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer is the most common cause of death in cancer worldwide, and cisplatin plays an important role in its treatment. However, the response to chemotherapy is poorly attributable to drug resistance. Our present study aimed to investigate the relation of the exosomal miR-146a-5p level with the chemosensitivity of NSCLC to cisplatin and the molecular mechanism that miR-146a-5p mediated to effect on chemotherapy response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The exosomes were isolated by ExoQuick kit. The exosomal morphology and particle size distribution were evaluated by the transmission electron microscopy and nanoSight assay respectively. Cell proliferation was detected using the MTT assay. NSCLC cells were infected with mimics or inhibitor to overexpress or downregulate miR-146a level. Besides, Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry were applied to detect the relative miRNA and protein levels. RESULTS: Advanced NSCLC patients with low serum exosomal miR-146a-5p levels had higher recurrence rates than those with high levels. A549/DDP cells and exosomes expressed higher miR-146a-5p than A549. In the process of cisplatin-induced drug resistance, the expression of miR-146a-5p decreased in either NSCLC cell lines or the exosomes gradually. What's more, the overexpression of miR-146a-5p could reverse the resistance of A549/DDP. And the possible mechanism of miR-146a-5p increasing chemosensitivity of NSCLC to cisplatin could be targeting Atg12 to inhibit autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: Serum exosomal miR-146a-5p may be a new biomarker predicting the efficacy of cisplatin for NSCLC patients and real-time monitoring drug resistance.

Comparison of isolation methods of exosomes and exosomal RNA from cell culture medium and serum.	Int J Mol Med	2017	Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles and are abundant in biological fluids; they contain RNA molecules which may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers in 'precision medicine'. To promote the clinical application of exosomal RNA (exoRNA), many isolation methods must be compared and validated. Exosomes in cell culture medium (CCM) and serum may be isolated using ultracentrifugation (UC), ExoQuick or Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (TEI), and exoRNA may be extracted using TRIzol-LS, SeraMir, Total Exosome RNA Isolation (TER), HiPure Liquid RNA/miRNA kit (HLR), miRNeasy or exoRNeasy. ExoRNA was assessed using NanoDrop, Bioanalyzer 2100, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and high-throughput sequencing. UC showed the lowest recovery of particles, but the highest protein purity for exosome isolation. For isolation of exoRNA, we found that combinations of the TEI and TER methods resulted in high extraction efficiency and purity of small RNA obtained using CCM. High yield and a narrow size distribution pattern of small RNA were shown in exoRNA isolated by exoRNeasy from serum. In RNA profile analysis, the small RNA constituent ratio, miRNA content and amount varied as a result of methodological differences. This study showed that different methods may introduce variations in the concentration, purity and size of exosomes and exoRNA. Herein we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and their application to different materials, therefore providing a reference according to research design.	PMC5548045

Exosomes Derived From Natural Killer Cells Exert Therapeutic Effect in Melanoma.	Theranostics	2017	Objective: Exosomes are nanovesicles that are released from normal and tumor cells and are detectable in cell culture supernatant and human biological fluids. Although previous studies have explored exosomes released from cancer cells, little is understood regarding the functions of exosomes released by normal cells. Natural killer (NK) cells display rapid immunity to metastatic or hematological malignancies, and efforts have been undertaken to clinically exploit the antitumor properties of NK cells. However, the characteristics and functions of exosomes derived from NK cells remain unknown. In this study, we explored NK cell-derived exosome-mediated antitumor effects against aggressive melanoma in vitro and in vivo. Methods: B16F10 cells were transfected with enhanced firefly luciferase (effluc) and thy1.1 genes, and thy1.1-positive cells were immunoselected using microbeads. The resulting B16F10/effluc cells were characterized using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and luciferase activity assays. Exosomes derived from NK-92MI cells (NK-92 Exo) were isolated by ultracentrifugation and density gradient ultracentrifugation. NK-92 Exo were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and western blotting. We also performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure cytokines retained in NK-92 Exo cells. The in vitro cytotoxicity of NK-92 Exo against the cancer cells was determined using a bioluminescence imaging system (BLI) and CCK-8 assays. To investigate the possible side effects of NK-92 Exo on healthy cells, we also performed the BLI and CCK-8 assays using the human kidney Phoenix™-Ampho cell line. Flow cytometry and western blotting confirmed that NK-92 Exo induced apoptosis in the B16F10/effluc cells. In vivo, we used a B16F10/effluc cell xenograft model to detect the immunotherapeutic effect of NK-92 Exo. We injected NK-92 Exo into tumors, and tumor growth progression was monitored using the IVIS Lumina imaging system and ultrasound imaging. Tumor mass was monitored after in vivo experiments. Results: RT-PCR and western blotting confirmed effluc gene expression and protein levels in B16F10/effluc cells. B16F10/effluc activity was found to increase with increasing cell numbers, using BLI assay. For NK-92 Exo characterization, western blotting was performed on both ultracentrifuged and density gradient-isolated exosomes. The results confirmed that NK cell-derived exosomes express two typical exosome proteins, namely CD63 and ALIX. We demonstrated by western blot analysis that NK-92 Exo presented two functional NK proteins, namely perforin and FasL. Moreover, we confirmed the membrane expression of FasL. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results indicated that NK-92 Exo can secrete tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which affected the cell proliferation signaling pathway. The antitumor effect of NK-92 Exo against B16F10/effluc cells in vitro was confirmed by BLI (p < 0.001) and CCK-8 assays (p < 0.001). Furthermore, in normal healthy cells, even after 24 h of co-culture, NK-92 Exo did not exhibit significant side effects. In the in vivo experiments, tumors in the vehicle control group were significantly increased, compared with those in the NK-92 Exo-treated group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results of the current study suggest that exosomes derived from NK cells exert cytotoxic effects on melanoma cells and thus warrant further development as a potential immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer.

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2017	Exosomes or microvesicles that are secreted from cells are considered to play important roles in tumor microenvironment. Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9), which is induced by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) in response to hypoxia, is overexpressed in many types of cancer including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We examined the expression level of CA9 in several RCC cell lines and found that the basal level of CA9 was much higher in OSRC-2 cells than in Caki-1, KMRC-1 and 786-O cells. Consistent with the intracellular expression levels, CA9 was abundantly detected in exosomes isolated by ultracentrifugation from OSRC-2 cells. Density gradient centrifugation of OSRC-2 and 786-O exosomes confirmed the co-presence of CA9 with exosomal markers. Upon hypoxia and treatment with CoCl2, a hypoxia mimic agent, the CA9 level in exosomes was increased for all cell lines. In order to examine the effects of CA9 exosomes on angiogenesis, we generated stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing CA9. Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated the uptake of CA9 exosomes by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In vitro angiogenesis assays using HUVEC revealed that CA9 exosomes promoted migration and tube formation. Lastly, MMP2 expression was increased by treatment with CA9 exosomes in HUVEC. Taken together, our results suggest the possibility that CA9 exosomes released from hypoxic RCC may enhance angiogenesis in microenvironment, thereby contributing to cancer progression.

J Invest Dermatol	2018	Healthy human skin sustains an effective immune defense mechanism, formed by a complex physical and chemical epidermal barrier that coordinates with different cellular components of the skin immune system. However, the mechanism by which skin cells regulate local immune homeostasis in health and disease contexts is not well known. To investigate whether exosomes exist in sweat, sweat samples from healthy individuals were collected after aerobic exercise. Sweat exosome was isolated via differential ultracentrifugation, observed under transmission electron microscopy, measured by dynamic light scattering, and confirmed by immunoblot. Further, shotgun liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS analysis was conducted to investigate the proteomic profiling of sweat exosome. Secreted exosome was detected in human sweat. A total of 1,062 proteins were identified in sweat exosome, including 997 different proteins compared with sweat proteomics and 896 unique proteins compared with urine, saliva, and plasma exosomes. Diverse antimicrobial peptides and immunological factors were found in sweat exosome, suggesting the involvement of exosome in skin immunity. This study provides direct evidence that secreted exosomes exist in human sweat. The proteomic profiling of sweat exosome provides insight into sweat features and the potential physiological significance of exosomes in immune homeostasis.

Exosomes Derived from Dendritic Cells Treated with Schistosoma japonicum Soluble Egg Antigen Attenuate DSS-Induced Colitis.	Front Pharmacol	2017	Exosomes are 30-150 nm small membrane vesicles that are released into the extracellular medium via cells that function as a mode of intercellular communication. Dendritic cell (DC)-derived exosomes modulate immune responses and prevent the development of autoimmune diseases. Moreover, Schistosoma japonicum eggs show modulatory effects in a mouse model of colitis. Therefore, we hypothesized that exosomes derived from DCs treated with S. japonicum soluble eggs antigen (SEA; SEA-treated DC exosomes) would be useful for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Exosomes were purified from the supernatant of DCs treated or untreated with SEA and identified via transmission electron microscopy, western blotting and NanoSight. Acute colitis was induced via the administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water (5.0%, wt/vol). Treatment with exosomes was conducted via intraperitoneal injection (i.p.; 50 μg per mouse) from day 0 to day 6. Clinical scores were calculated based on weight loss, stool type, and bleeding. Colon length was measured as an indirect marker of inflammation, and colon macroscopic characteristics were determined. Body weight loss and the disease activity index of DSS-induced colitis mice decreased significantly following treatment with SEA-treated DC exosomes. Moreover, the colon lengths of SEA-treated DC exosomes treated colitis mice improved, and their mean colon macroscopic scores decreased. In addition, histologic examinations and histological scores showed that SEA-treated DC exosomes prevented colon damage in acute DSS-induced colitis mice. These results indicate that SEA-treated DC exosomes attenuate the severity of acute DSS-induced colitis mice more effectively than DC exosomes. The current work suggests that SEA-treated DC exosomes may be useful as a new approach to treat IBD.	PMC5603738

Electronic address: .	mark.mattson@nih.gov		Intercellular transfer of pathogenic α-synuclein by extracellular vesicles is induced by the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal.	Neurobiol Aging	2018	Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by accumulations of toxic α-synuclein aggregates in vulnerable neuronal populations in the brainstem, midbrain, and cerebral cortex. Recent findings suggest that α-synuclein pathology can be propagated transneuronally, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Advances in the genetics of rare early-onset familial PD indicate that increased production and/or reduced autophagic clearance of α-synuclein can cause PD. The cause of the most common late-onset PD is unclear, but may involve metabolic compromise and oxidative stress upstream of α-synuclein accumulation. As evidence, the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) is elevated in the brain during normal aging and moreso in brain regions afflicted with α-synuclein pathology. Here, we report that HNE increases aggregation of endogenous α-synuclein in primary neurons and triggers the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing cytotoxic oligomeric α-synuclein species. EVs released from HNE-treated neurons are internalized by healthy neurons which as a consequence degenerate. Levels of endogenously generated HNE are elevated in cultured cells overexpressing human α-synuclein, and EVs released from those cells are toxic to neurons. The EV-associated α-synuclein is located both inside the vesicles and on their surface, where it plays a role in EV internalization by neurons. On internalization, EVs harboring pathogenic α-synuclein are transported both anterogradely and retrogradely within axons. Focal injection of EVs containing α-synuclein into the striatum of wild-type mice results in spread of synuclein pathology to anatomically connected brain regions. Our findings suggest a scenario for late-onset PD in which lipid peroxidation promotes intracellular accumulation and then extrusion of EVs containing toxic α-synuclein species; the EVs are then internalized by adjacent neurons, so propagating the neurodegenerative process.

Sci Rep	2017	Exosomes are membrane enclosed nano-sized vesicles actively released into the extracellular milieu that can harbor genomic, proteomic and lipid cargos. Functionally, they are shown to regulate cell-cell communication and transmission of pathogens. Though studies have implicated a role for exosomes in HIV-1 pathogenesis, their mechanisms are not well defined. Here, we characterized exosomes derived from uninfected or HIV-1 infected T-cells and DCs. We demonstrate substantial differences in morphological, molecular and biogenesis machinery between exosomes derived from these two immune cell types. In addition, exosomes derived from HIV-1 infected DCs were 4 fold more infective than either cell free HIV-1 or exosomes derived from T-cells. Molecular analysis of exosomes detected the presence of fibronectin and galectin-3 in those derived from DCs, whereas T-cell exosomes lacked these molecules. Addition of anti-fibronectin antibody and β-lactose, a galectin-3 antagonist, significantly blocked DC exosome-mediated HIV-1 infection of T-cells. We also observed increased gene expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β and RANTES and activation of p38/Stat pathways in T-cells exposed to exosomes derived from HIV-1 infected DCs. Our study provides insight into the role of exosomes in HIV pathogenesis and suggests they can be a target in development of novel therapeutic strategies against viral infection.	PMC5665889

Plant extracellular vesicles are incorporated by a fungal pathogen and inhibit its growth.	J Exp Bot	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EV) are membrane particles released by cells into their environment and are considered to be key players in intercellular communication. EV are produced by all domains of life but limited knowledge about EV in plants is available, although their implication in plant defense has been suggested. We have characterized sunflower EV and tested whether they could interact with fungal cells. EV were isolated from extracellular fluids of seedlings and characterized by transmission electron microscopy and proteomic analysis. These nanovesicles appeared to be enriched in cell wall remodeling enzymes and defense proteins. Membrane-labeled EV were prepared and their uptake by the phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was verified. Functional tests further evaluated the ability of EV to affect fungal growth. Spores treated with plant EV showed growth inhibition, morphological changes, and cell death. Conclusive evidence on the existence of plant EV is presented and we demonstrate their ability to interact with and kill fungal cells. Our results introduce the concept of cell-to-cell communication through EV in plants.

Exosomes from heat-stressed tumour cells inhibit tumour growth by converting regulatory T cells to Th17 cells via IL-6.	Immunology	2018	Exosomes derived from heat-stressed tumour cells (HS-TEXs), which contain abundant heat shock protein (HSP) 70, strongly induce antitumour immune responses. HSP70-induced interleukin (IL)-6 promotes IL-17 expression and causes rejection of established prostate tumours. However, it remains unclear whether HS-TEXs exhibit antitumour effects by converting regulatory T cells (Tregs ) into T helper type 17 (Th17) cells. In this study, we found that compared with TEXs, HS-TEXs were more potent in stimulating secretion of IL-6 from dendritic cells. In vitro, IL-6 blocked tumour cell-derived transforming growth factor beta 1-induced Treg differentiation and promoted Th17 cell differentiation. HS-TEXs exerted strong antitumour effects, converting Tregs into Th17 cells with high efficiency, a process that was entirely dependent upon IL-6. Neutralization of IL-17 completely abolished the antitumour effect of TEXs, but only partially inhibited that of HS-TEXs. In addition, we found higher levels of IL-6 and IL-17 in serum from tumour patients treated with hyperthermia, and an increase in Th17 cells and a decrease in Tregs was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from these patients after hyperthermia. Therefore, our results demonstrate that HS-TEXs possess a powerful capacity to convert immunosuppressive Tregs into Th17 cells via IL-6, which contributes to their potent antitumour effect.

An Exosome-Based Vaccine Platform Imparts Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Immunity Against Viral Antigens.	Biotechnol J	2018	Exosomes are 50-150 nm sized nanovesicles released by all eukaryotic cells. The authors very recently described a method to engineer exosomes in vivo with the E7 protein of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). This technique consists in the intramuscular injection of a DNA vector expressing HPV-E7 fused at the C-terminus of an exosome-anchoring protein, that is, Nefmut , the authors previously characterized for its high levels of incorporation in exosomes. In this configuration, the ≈11 kDa E7 protein elicited a both strong and effective antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity. Attempting to establish whether this method could have general applicability, the authors expanded the immunogenicity studies toward an array of viral products of various origin and size including Ebola Virus VP24, VP40 and NP, Influenza Virus NP, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever NP, West Nile Virus NS3, and Hepatitis C Virus NS3. All antigens appeared stable upon fusion with Nefmut , and are uploaded in exosomes at levels comparable to Nefmut . When injected in mice, DNA vectors expressing the diverse fusion products elicited a well detectable antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response associating with a cytotoxic activity potent enough to kill peptide-loaded and/or antigen-expressing syngeneic cells. These data definitely proven both effectiveness and flexibility of this innovative CTL vaccine platform.

Novel Therapy for Glioblastoma Multiforme by Restoring LRRC4 in Tumor Cells: LRRC4 Inhibits Tumor-Infitrating Regulatory T Cells by Cytokine and Programmed Cell Death 1-Containing Exosomes.	Front Immunol	2017	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a heterogeneous malignant brain tumor, the pathological incidence of which induces the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). As a tumor suppressor gene, LRRC4 is absent in GBM cells. Here, we report that the recovery of LRRC4 in GBM cells inhibited the infiltration of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Ti-Treg), promoted the expansion of tumor-infiltrating effector T (Ti-Teff) cells and CD4+CCR4+ T cells, and enhanced the chemotaxis of CD4+CCR4+ T cells in the GBM immune microenvironment. LRRC4 was not transferred into TILs from GBM cells through exosomes but mainly exerted its inhibiting function on Ti-Treg cell expansion by directly promoting cytokine secretion. GBM cell-derived exosomes (cytokine-free and programmed cell death 1 containing) also contributed to the modulation of LRRC4 on Ti-Treg, Ti-Teff, and CD4+CCR4+ T cells. In GBM cells, LRRC4 directly bound to phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1), phosphorylated IKKβser181, facilitated NF-κB activation, and promoted the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6), CCL2, and interferon gamma. In addition, HSP90 was required to maintain the interaction between LRRC4 and PDPK1. However, the inhibition of Ti-Treg cell expansion and promotion of CD4+CCR4+ T cell chemotaxis by LRRC4 could be blocked by anti-IL-6 antibody or anti-CCL2 antibody, respectively. miR-101 is a suppressor gene in GBM. Our previous studies have shown that EZH2, EED, and DNMT3A are direct targets of miR-101. Here, we showed that miR-101 reversed the hypermethylation of the LRRC4 promoter and induced the re-expression of LRRC4 in GBM cells by directly targeting EZH2, EED, and DNMT3A. Our results reveal a novel mechanism underlying GBM microenvironment and provide a new therapeutic strategy using re-expression of LRRC4 in GBM cells to create a permissive intratumoral environment.

Exosomes-Small Players, Big Sound.	Bioconjug Chem	2018	Incipiently named extracellular vesicles, exosomes are forming now a separate class of cellular mediators with important functions in physiological and pathological states. Their ability to transfer information between cells through encapsulation of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids for the preservation of the homeostatic equilibrium is translated also in pathological conditions. The recipient cells react to the reception of foreign molecules adjusting their molecular state according to the enclosed message. Cancer cells, in order to influence the microenvironment and facilitate the malignant expanding, exploit this intercellular trafficking. Immune cells are also producing exosomes that ensure the transportation of immune mediators and signaling molecules between cells. Current experimental attempts are concentrated on the adjustment of exosomes level for therapeutic purposes, enrolment of these vesicles as diagnosis or prognosis tools and also exosomes' use as drug delivery vehicles or immune stimulatory agents.

Exosomes Derived from Hypoxia-Treated Human Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cells Enhance Angiogenesis Through the PKA Signaling Pathway.	Stem Cells Dev	2018	Angiogenesis is a complicated and sequential process that plays an important role in different physiological processes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are pluripotent stem cells, are widely used for the treatment of ischemic and traumatic diseases, and exosomes derived from these cells can also promote angiogenesis. Therefore, we aimed to uncover mechanisms to improve MSC exosome-mediated angiogenesis. For this study, we isolated human adipose-derived MSCs (hAD-MSCs) and assessed differentiation ability and markers. Cells were divided into hypoxia-treated MSCs (H-MSCs) and normoxia-treated MSCs (N-MSC), and exosomes were extracted by ultrafiltration. Exosomes (100 μg/mL) from H-MSCs and N-MSCs were added to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Exosome uptake and the ability of endothelial cells to form tubes were detected in real time. Protein samples were collected at different time points to detect the expression of inhibitors (Vash1) and enhancers (Angpt1 and Flk1) of angiogenesis; we also assessed their related signaling pathways. We found that exosomes from the hypoxia group were more easily taken up by HUVECs; furthermore, their angiogenesis stimulatory activity was also significantly enhanced compared to that with exosomes from the normoxia group. HUVECs exposed to exosomes from H-MSCs significantly upregulated angiogenesis-stimulating genes and deregulated angiogenesis-inhibitory genes. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway in HUVECs were significantly increased by hypoxia-exposed exosomes. Moreover, a PKA inhibitor was shown to significantly suppress angiogenesis. Finally, we concluded that hypoxia-exposed exosomes derived from hAD-MSCs can improve angiogenesis by activating the PKA signaling pathway and promoting the expression of VEGF. These results could be used to uncover safe and effective treatments for traumatic diseases.

Mol Ther	2018	Chemoresistance is one of the causes of adverse effects in gastric cancer, including a poor response to cisplatin (DDP). Exosomes loaded with microRNA (miRNA), mRNA, and other non-coding RNAs could regulate drug resistance. Exo-anti-214 was extracted and verified. A Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) cell viability assay, flow cytometry, and transwell and immunofluorescence assays were performed to determine whether exo-anti-214 could sensitize cells to DDP in vitro. A combination of intravenously injected exo-anti-214 and intraperitoneal DDP was utilized in vivo. Additionally, potential targets of miR-214 were screened by mass spectrometry (MS) and confirmed via western blotting (WB). The levels of miR-214 in the human immortalized gastric epithelial cell line ges-1 and the human gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines SGC7901 and SGC7901/DDP gradually increased. Exo-anti-214 could fuse with cells and regulate potential targets, reducing cell viability, suppressing migration, and promoting apoptosis in vitro. Caudally injected exo-anti-214 was applied to reverse chemoresistance and repress tumor growth in vivo due to the downregulation of miR-214 and overexpression of possible target proteins in tumors. Exo-anti-214 could reverse the resistance to DDP in gastric cancer, which might serve as a potential alternative for the treatment of cisplatin-refractory gastric cancer in the future.	PMC5910674

The chemokine receptor CCR1 is identified in mast cell-derived exosomes.	Am J Transl Res	2018	Mast cells are important effector cells of the immune system, and mast cell-derived exosomes carrying RNAs play a role in immune regulation. However, the molecular function of mast cell-derived exosomes is currently unknown, and here, we identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in mast cells and exosomes. We isolated mast cells derived exosomes through differential centrifugation and screened the DEGs from mast cell-derived exosomes, using the GSE25330 array dataset downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Biochemical pathways were analyzed by Gene ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway on the online tool DAVID. DEGs-associated protein-protein interaction networks (PPIs) were constructed using the STRING database and Cytoscape software. The genes identified from these bioinformatics analyses were verified by qRT-PCR and Western blot in mast cells and exosomes. We identified 2121 DEGs (843 up and 1278 down-regulated genes) in HMC-1 cell-derived exosomes and HMC-1 cells. The up-regulated DEGs were classified into two significant modules. The chemokine receptor CCR1 was screened as a hub gene and enriched in cytokine-mediated signaling pathway in module one. Seven genes, including CCR1, CD9, KIT, TGFBR1, TLR9, TPSAB1 and TPSB2 were screened and validated through qRT-PCR analysis. We have achieved a comprehensive view of the pivotal genes and pathways in mast cells and exosomes and identified CCR1 as a hub gene in mast cell-derived exosomes. Our results provide novel clues with respect to the biological processes through which mast cell-derived exosomes modulate immune responses.	PMC5835801

In Utero Exposure to Exosomal and B-Cell Alloantigens Lessens Alloreactivity of Recipients' Lymphocytes Rather than Confers Allograft Tolerance.	Front Immunol	2018	According to actively acquired tolerance, antigen exposure before full immune development in fetal or early neonatal life will cause tolerance to this specific antigen. In this study, we aimed to examine whether allogeneic tolerance could be elicited by in utero exposure to surface MHC antigens of allogenic cells or soluble form of MHC exosomes. Gestational day 14 FVB/N fetuses were subjected to intraperitoneal injection of allogeneic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exosomes or highly enriched B-cells. Postnatally, the recipients were examined for the immune responses to donor alloantigens by lymphocyte proliferative reactions and skin transplantation. In utero exposure to allogeneic MHC exosomes abolished the alloreactivity of recipients' lymphocytes to the alloantigens, but could not confer skin allograft tolerance. In utero transplantation of highly enriched allogeneic B-cells generated low-level B-cell chimerism in the recipients. However, it only extended the survivals of skin allograft by a few days despite the lack of donor-specific alloreactivity of recipients' lymphocyte. Thus, an early in utero contact with exosomal or B-cell alloantigens did not lead to full skin tolerance but rather, at best, only to delayed skin rejection in the presence of microchimerism made by B-cell inocula. These results argued against the theory of actively acquired tolerance, and implicated that in utero exposure to marrow cells in previous studies was a unique model of allo-tolerance induction that involved the establishment of significant hematopoietic chimerism. Taken together with the discovery of in utero sensitization to ovalbumin in our previous studies, the immunological consequences of fetal exposure to foreign antigens might vary according to the type or nature of antigens introduced.

Mol Neurobiol	2018	Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) prior to the age of 65 years is classified as young-onset (YOAD), whereas diagnosis after the age of 65 years is considered late-onset (LOAD). Although rare autosomal mutations more commonly associate with YOAD, most YOAD and LOAD cases are sporadic. YOAD and LOAD share amyloid and tau pathology, but many YOAD patients show increased disease severity and rate of progression. The current study examined the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile from exosomes isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of YOAD patients with biomarker-confirmed AD. Results uncovered miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-451a, and miR-605-5p as differentially expressed in the CSF-derived exosomes of YOAD patients when compared with healthy controls (HC). In a cohort of LOAD patients, miR-125b-5p, miR-451a, and miR-605-5p were similarly altered in expression, but miR-16-5p showed similar expression to control. Analysis of the mRNA targets of these miRNAs revealed transcripts enriched in biological processes relevant to the post-mortem posterior cingulate cortex transcriptome in YOAD from a previously published microarray study, including those related to neuron projections, synaptic signaling, metabolism, apoptosis, and the immune system. Hence, these miRNAs represent novel targets for uncovering disease mechanisms and for biomarker development in both YOAD and LOAD.

Deterministic Encapsulation of Human Cardiac Stem Cells in Variable Composition Nanoporous Gel Cocoons To Enhance Therapeutic Repair of Injured Myocardium.	ACS Nano	2018	Although cocooning explant-derived cardiac stem cells (EDCs) in protective nanoporous gels (NPGs) prior to intramyocardial injection boosts long-term cell retention, the number of EDCs that finally engraft is trivial and unlikely to account for salutary effects on myocardial function and scar size. As such, we investigated the effect of varying the NPG content within capsules to alter the physical properties of cocoons without influencing cocoon dimensions. Increasing NPG concentration enhanced cell migration and viability while improving cell-mediated repair of injured myocardium. Given that the latter occurred with NPG content having no detectable effect on the long-term engraftment of transplanted cells, we found that changing the physical properties of cocoons prompted explant-derived cardiac stem cells to produce greater amounts of cytokines, nanovesicles, and microRNAs that boosted the generation of new blood vessels and new cardiomyocytes. Thus, by altering the physical properties of cocoons by varying NPG content, the paracrine signature of encapsulated cells can be enhanced to promote greater endogenous repair of injured myocardium.

J Biol Chem	2018	Prions are protein-based infectious agents that autocatalytically convert the cellular prion protein PrPC to its pathological isoform PrPSc Subsequent aggregation and accumulation of PrPSc in nervous tissues causes several invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals. Prions can infect recipient cells when packaged into endosome-derived nanoparticles called exosomes, which are present in biological fluids such as blood, urine, and saliva. Autophagy is a basic cellular degradation and recycling machinery that also affects exosomal processing, but whether autophagy controls release of prions in exosomes is unclear. Our work investigated the effect of autophagy modulation on exosomal release of prions and how this interplay affects cellular prion infection. Exosomes isolated from cultured murine central neuronal cells (CAD5) and peripheral neuronal cells (N2a) contained prions as shown by immunoblotting for PrPSc, prion conversion activity, and cell culture infection. We observed that autophagy stimulation with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin strongly inhibited exosomal prion release. In contrast, inhibition of autophagy by wortmannin or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the autophagy protein autophagy related 5 (Atg5) greatly increased the release of exosomes and exosome-associated prions. We also show that a difference in exosomal prion release between CAD5 and N2a cells is related to differences at the level of basal autophagy. Taken together, our results indicate that autophagy modulation can control lateral transfer of prions by interfering with their exosomal release. We describe a novel role of autophagy in the prion life cycle, an understanding that may provide useful targets for containing prion diseases.

J Frailty Aging	2018	Frailty is a geriatric syndrome associated with progressive physical decline and significantly increases risk for falls, disability, hospitalizations, and death. However, much remains unknown regarding the biological mechanisms that contribute to aging and frailty, and to date, there are no clinically used prognostic or diagnostic molecular biomarkers. The present study profiled exosome-derived microRNAs isolated from the plasma of young, robust older, and frail older individuals and identified eight miRNAs that are uniquely enriched in frailty: miR-10a-3p, miR-92a-3p, miR-185-3p, miR-194-5p, miR-326, miR-532-5p, miR-576-5p, and miR-760. Furthermore, since exosomes can deliver miRNAs to alter cellular activity and behavior, these miRNAs may also provide insights into the biological mechanisms underlying frailty; KEGG analysis of their target genes revealed multiple pathways implicated in aging and age-related processes. Although further validation and research studies are warranted, our study identified eight novel candidate biomarkers of frailty that may help to elucidate the multifactorial pathogenesis of frailty.

Cardiac progenitor cell‑derived exosomes promote H9C2 cell growth via Akt/mTOR activation.	Int J Mol Med	2018	Exosomes are cell‑derived vesicles released from a variety of mammalian cells that are involved in cell‑to‑cell signalling. It has been reported that cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) derived from an adult heart are one of the most promising stem cell types for cardioprotection and repair. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway is a pivotal regulator in CPCs, therefore, CPC‑derived exosomes were used in the present study to investigate whether it can promote H9C2 cell growth through the protein kinase B (PKB, or Akt)/mTOR signalling pathway. The CPCs were isolated from Sprague‑Dawley hearts. Following treatment with a specific medium, the exosomes were purified and identified by electron micrograph and western blot assays, using CD63 and CD81 as markers. The methyl‑thiazolyl‑tetrazolium and 5‑ethynyl‑2'‑deoxyuridine methods were used to detect H9C2 cell growth. The expression of Akt and mTOR were detected by western blot analysis following treatment with 200 or 400 µg/ml of exosomes for 24 or 48 h, respectively. It was found that, compared with higher concentrations of exosomes, prolonging the duration of exposure promoted cell growth. Accordingly, CPC‑derived exosomes stimulated the expression of Akt to a marked degree; groups treated with exosomes for 48 h showed higher expression of Akt than those treated for 24 h at the same concentration. mTOR was also stimulated by CPC‑derived exosomes. The activation of mTOR increased in accordance with the treatment time at an exosome concentration of 200 µg/ml and decreased with treatment time at an exosome concentration of 400 µg/ml. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that CPC‑derived exosomes promoted H9C2 cell growth via the activation of Akt/mTOR in a time‑dependent manner at a relatively low exosome concentration, which may provide a novel therapy for cardiovascular disease.

Medicina (B Aires)	2000	Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen presenting cells and the only ones capable of inducing primary cytotoxic immune responses. We found that DCs secrete a population of membrane vesicles, called exosomes. Exosomes are 60-80 nm vesicles of endocytic origin. The protein composition of exosomes was subjected to a systematic proteomic analysis. Besides MHC and co-stimulatory molecules, exosomes bear several adhesion proteins, most likely involved in their specific subjected to targeting. We also found that exosomes accumulate several cytosolic factors, probably involved in their endosomal biogenesis. Like DCs, exosomes induced immune responses in vivo. Indeed, a single injection of DC-derived exosomes sensitized with tumor peptides induced potent anti tumor immune responses in mice and the eradication of established tumors. Tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes were found in the spleen of exosome-treated mice, and the anti tumor effect of exosomes was sensitive to in vivo depletion of CD8+ T cells. These results show that exosomes induce potent anti tumor effects in vivo, and strongly support the implementation of human DC-derived exosomes for cancer immunotherapy.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2004	Urine provides an alternative to blood plasma as a potential source of disease biomarkers. One urinary biomarker already exploited in clinical studies is aquaporin-2. However, it remains a mystery how aquaporin-2 (an integral membrane protein) and other apical transporters are delivered to the urine. Here we address the hypothesis that these proteins reach the urine through the secretion of exosomes [membrane vesicles that originate as internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs)]. Low-density urinary membrane vesicles from normal human subjects were isolated by differential centrifugation. ImmunoGold electron microscopy using antibodies directed to cytoplasmic or anticytoplasmic epitopes revealed that the vesicles are oriented "cytoplasmic-side inward," consistent with the unique orientation of exosomes. The vesicles were small (<100 nm), consistent with studies of MVBs and exosomes from other tissues. Proteomic analysis of urinary vesicles through nanospray liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified numerous protein components of MVBs and of the endosomal pathway in general. Full liquid chromatography-tandem MS analysis revealed 295 proteins, including multiple protein products of genes already known to be responsible for renal and systemic diseases, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, Gitelman syndrome, Bartter syndrome, autosomal recessive syndrome of osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis, and familial renal hypomagnesemia. The results indicate that exosome isolation may provide an efficient first step in biomarker discovery in urine.	PMC516573

Allogeneic tumor cells expressing fusogenic membrane glycoproteins as a platform for clinical cancer immunotherapy.	Clin Cancer Res	2006	PURPOSE: Fusogenic membrane glycoproteins (FMG), such as the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G), represent a new class of gene therapy for cancer that cause cytotoxic fusion on expression in tumor cells. In addition, FMG-mediated tumor cell death stimulates antitumor immunity, suggesting potential applications for FMG-expressing cellular vaccines. This study addresses the promise of FMG-expressing allogeneic tumor cells, which are most practical for clinical use, as a novel platform for ex vivo and in situ vaccination. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Murine B16 melanoma-derived cell lines expressing autologous or allogeneic MHC class I, expressing fusogenic or nonfusogenic VSV-G, were used to vaccinate mice in vivo against a live tumor challenge. Exosome-like vesicles released by fusing allogeneic cells (syncitiosomes) and intratumoral injection of fusing vaccines were also tested as novel therapeutic strategies for their antitumor effects. RESULTS: Expression of fusogenic VSV-G enhanced the immunogenicity of an allogeneic cellular vaccine, which was more effective than a fusing autologous vaccine. Allogeneic syncitiosomes were only as effective as cellular vaccines when administered with adjuvant, demonstrating that syncitiosomes cannot account entirely for the mechanism of immune priming. Intratumoral injection of FMG-expressing allogeneic cells led to significant tumor regression using both fusogenic or nonfusogenic VSV-G. However, specific priming against tumor-associated antigenic epitopes and protection against secondary rechallenge only occurred if the initial vaccine was competent for cell fusion. CONCLUSIONS: FMG-expressing allogeneic tumor cells are a potent source of antitumor vaccines. Syncitiosomes given with adjuvant and intratumoral injection of fusing cells represent novel strategies well-suited to clinical translation.

J Anim Sci	2007	The rumen has several important physiological functions: absorption, transport, metabolic activity, and protection. To clarify the molecular basis underlying the physiological function of the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum, we used mRNA differential display to isolate and identify differentially expressed genes in these tissues. We isolated 18 transcripts that coexpressed in the rumen, reticulum, and omasum. Five genes, ribosomal protein 19 (RPS19), basic helix-loop-helix domain containing class B2 (BHLHB2), NADH dehydrogenase flavoprotein 2 (NDUFV2), exosome component 9 (EXOSC9), and ribosomal protein 23 (RPS23), were highly expressed in the rumen of adult Holstein and Japanese Black cattle. Significant differences of expression were observed in the abomasum compared with the rumen, reticulum, and omasum. To investigate the expression pattern of these genes during the neonatal growth stage, the relative levels of gene expression were analyzed in the rumen and abomasum of 3-wk-, 13-wk-, and 18- to 20-mo-old Holstein cattle. The expression level of RPS19 did not change with age in the rumen and abomasum. The levels of BHLHB2, NDUFV2, and EXOSC9 mRNA in the abomasum decreased (P < 0.05) after weaning and declined (P < 0.05) further in adults; in contrast, expression in the rumen was not altered. Interestingly, the levels of RPS23 mRNA in the rumen increased (P < 0.05) after weaning and further increased in the adult; however, the level of expression of this gene decreased (P < 0.05) in the abomasum with weaning and age. This indicates that the 4 tissues, especially the rumen and abomasum, have different developmental pathways after birth and subsequent onset of rumination.

Evidence for secretion of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase via exosomes from a cell model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Neurosci Lett	2007	A familial form of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is caused by dominant mutations in the cytosolic Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). There has been evidence for secretion of SOD1, by an unknown mechanism. In this work stable mouse motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells overexpressing human SOD1 wild-type hSOD1(wt) (NSC-34/hSOD1(wt)) and mutant hSOD1(G93A) (NSC-34/hSOD1(G93A)) have been used as an ALS cell model. SOD1 was found to be secreted in association with a membrane fraction that pelleted at 100,000xg. Sucrose density gradient separation of this fraction showed that wild-type and mutant SOD1 were found between 0.5 and 1.16M sucrose and co-localized with the exosomal marker CD9. Therefore, SOD1 secretion occurred via exosomes. p115 a cytosolic and Golgi apparatus (GA) protein involved in vesicle tethering was also found in exosomes, contrary to the endoplasmic reticulum protein calnexin. SOD1 secretion mediated by exosomes could explain cell-to-cell transfer of mutant toxicity.

TRF4 is involved in polyadenylation of snRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster.	Mol Cell Biol	2008	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae poly(A) polymerases Trf4 and Trf5 are involved in an RNA quality control mechanism, where polyadenylated RNAs are degraded by the nuclear exosome. Although Trf4/5 homologue genes are distributed throughout multicellular organisms, their biological roles remain to be elucidated. We isolated here the two homologues of Trf4/5 in Drosophila melanogaster, named DmTRF4-1 and DmTRF4-2, and investigated their biological function. DmTRF4-1 displayed poly(A) polymerase activity in vitro, whereas DmTRF4-2 did not. Gene knockdown of DmTRF4-1 by RNA interference is lethal in flies, as is the case for the trf4 trf5 double mutants. In contrast, disruption of DmTRF4-2 results in viable flies. Cellular localization analysis suggested that DmTRF4-1 localizes in the nucleolus. Abnormal polyadenylation of snRNAs was observed in transgenic flies overexpressing DmTRF4-1 and was slightly increased by the suppression of DmRrp6, the 3'-5' exonuclease of the nuclear exosome. These results suggest that DmTRF4-1 and DmRrp6 are involved in the polyadenylation-mediated degradation of snRNAs in vivo.	PMC2573236

Mol Cell Proteomics	2009	Novel markers for prostate cancer (PCa) are needed because current established markers such as prostate-specific antigen lack diagnostic specificity and prognostic value. Proteomics analysis of serum from mice grafted with human PCa xenografts resulted in the identification of 44 tumor-derived proteins. Besides secreted proteins we identified several cytoplasmic proteins, among which were most subunits of the proteasome. Native gel electrophoresis and sandwich ELISA showed that these subunits are present as proteasome complexes in the serum from xenograft-bearing mice. We hypothesized that the presence of proteasome subunits and other cytoplasmic proteins in serum of xenografted mice could be explained by the secretion of small vesicles by cancer cells, so-called exosomes. Therefore, mass spectrometry and Western blotting analyses of the protein content of exosomes isolated from PCa cell lines was performed. This resulted in the identification of mainly cytoplasmic proteins of which several had previously been identified in the serum of xenografted mice, including proteasome subunits. The isolated exosomes also contained RNA, including the gene fusion TMPRSS2-ERG product. These observations suggest that although their function is not clearly defined cancer-derived exosomes offer possibilities for the identification of novel biomarkers for PCa.	PMC2690478

The role of cbl family of ubiquitin ligases in gastric cancer exosome-induced apoptosis of Jurkat T cells.	Acta Oncol	2009	BACKGROUND. Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles with immunomodulatory functions, which are released by a diverse range of living cells. Although recent studies have shown that tumor-derived exosomes can suppress the function of T cells, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of the Casitas B lineage lymphoma (cbl) family of ubiquitin ligases in gastric cancer exosome-induced apoptosis of Jurkat T cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS. By serial centrifugation and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, we isolated and purified the exosomes from gastric cancer SGC7901 cells, and identified them by electron microscopy and Western blotting. Cell apoptosis was detected using propidium iodide staining. Western blotting and RT-PCR was exploited to evaluate the expression of proteins and mRNA, respectively. RESULTS. Gastric cancer exosomes induced Jurkat T cell apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner and activated caspases 3, 8 and 9. The expression of Cbl-b and c-Cbl was up-regulated during exosome-induced apoptosis of cells. Meanwhile, exosomes induced ubiquitination of the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and reduced downstream Akt activity. Inhibition of proteasome led to partial restoration of Akt activity and cell apoptosis. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS. The Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases might be involved in regulation of exosome-induced apoptosis of Jurkat T cells by increasing PI3K proteasome degradation, inactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling, thus mediating some effects of caspase activation.

Visualizing of the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of exosomes by live-cell microscopy.	J Cell Biochem	2010	Cells release exosomes to transfer various molecules to other cells. Exosomes are involved in a number of physiological and pathological processes. They are emerging great potential utility for diseases diagnosis and treatment recently. However, the internalization and intracellular trafficking of exosomes have not been described clearly. In this work, exosomes were isolated from the culture medium of PC12 cells, labeled by lipophilic dye and amino-reactive fluorophore, incubated with resting PC12 cells. The results of live-cell microscopy indicated that exosomes were internalized through endocytosis pathway, trapped in vesicles, and transported to perinuclear region. Particle tracking fluorescent vesicles suggested that the active transport of exosomes may be mediated by cytoskeleton. The proteins on exosome membrane were found to be released from exosomes and trapped in lysosome. The inverted transport of lipophilic dye from perinuclear region to cell peripheries was revealed, possibly caused by recycling of the exosome lipids. This study provides new sight into the mechanisms of exosome uptake and intracellular fate.

Exosome-driven antigen transfer for MHC class II presentation facilitated by the receptor binding activity of influenza hemagglutinin.	J Immunol	2010	The mechanisms underlying MHC class I-restricted cross-presentation, the transfer of Ag from an infected cell to a professional APC, have been studied in great detail. Much less is known about the equivalent process for MHC class II-restricted presentation. After infection or transfection of class II-negative donor cells, we observed minimal transfer of a proteasome-dependent "class I-like" epitope within the influenza neuraminidase glycoprotein but potent transfer of a classical, H-2M-dependent epitope within the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. Additional experiments determined transfer to be exosome-mediated and substantially enhanced by the receptor binding activity of incorporated HA. Furthermore, a carrier effect was observed in that incorporated HA improved exosome-mediated transfer of a second membrane protein. This route of Ag presentation should be relevant to other enveloped viruses, may skew CD4(+) responses toward exosome-incorporated glycoproteins, and points toward novel vaccine strategies.

Nat Biotechnol	2011	To realize the therapeutic potential of RNA drugs, efficient, tissue-specific and nonimmunogenic delivery technologies must be developed. Here we show that exosomes-endogenous nano-vesicles that transport RNAs and proteins-can deliver short interfering (si)RNA to the brain in mice. To reduce immunogenicity, we used self-derived dendritic cells for exosome production. Targeting was achieved by engineering the dendritic cells to express Lamp2b, an exosomal membrane protein, fused to the neuron-specific RVG peptide. Purified exosomes were loaded with exogenous siRNA by electroporation. Intravenously injected RVG-targeted exosomes delivered GAPDH siRNA specifically to neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes in the brain, resulting in a specific gene knockdown. Pre-exposure to RVG exosomes did not attenuate knockdown, and non-specific uptake in other tissues was not observed. The therapeutic potential of exosome-mediated siRNA delivery was demonstrated by the strong mRNA (60%) and protein (62%) knockdown of BACE1, a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, in wild-type mice.

Quantitative proteomics and dynamic imaging of the nucleolus reveal distinct responses to UV and ionizing radiation.	Mol Cell Proteomics	2011	The nucleolus is a nuclear organelle that coordinates rRNA transcription and ribosome subunit biogenesis. Recent proteomic analyses have shown that the nucleolus contains proteins involved in cell cycle control, DNA processing and DNA damage response and repair, in addition to the many proteins connected with ribosome subunit production. Here we study the dynamics of nucleolar protein responses in cells exposed to stress and DNA damage caused by ionizing and ultraviolet (UV) radiation in diploid human fibroblasts. We show using a combination of imaging and quantitative proteomics methods that nucleolar substructure and the nucleolar proteome undergo selective reorganization in response to UV damage. The proteomic responses to UV include alterations of functional protein complexes such as the SSU processome and exosome, and paraspeckle proteins, involving both decreases and increases in steady state protein ratios, respectively. Several nonhomologous end-joining proteins (NHEJ), such as Ku70/80, display similar fast responses to UV. In contrast, nucleolar proteomic responses to IR are both temporally and spatially distinct from those caused by UV, and more limited in terms of magnitude. With the exception of the NHEJ and paraspeckle proteins, where IR induces rapid and transient changes within 15 min of the damage, IR does not alter the ratios of most other functional nucleolar protein complexes. The rapid transient decrease of NHEJ proteins in the nucleolus indicates that it may reflect a response to DNA damage. Our results underline that the nucleolus is a specific stress response organelle that responds to different damage and stress agents in a unique, damage-specific manner.	PMC3205868

J Proteomics	2012	Exosomes are 40-100 nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin, secreted by cells and are found in biological fluids including milk. These exosomes are extracellular organelles important in intracellular communication, and immune function. Therefore, the proteome of bovine milk exosomes may provide insight into the complex processes of milk production. Exosomes were isolated from the milk of mid-lactation cows. Purified exosomes were trypsin digested, subjected offline high pH reverse phase chromatography and further fractionated on a nanoLC connected to tandem mass spectrometer. This resulted in identification of 2107 proteins that included all of the major exosome protein markers. The major milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) proteins (Butyrophilin, Xanthine oxidase, Adipophilin and Lactadherin) were the most abundant proteins found in milk exosomes. However, they represented only 0.4-1.2% of the total spectra collected from milk exosomes compared to 15-28% of the total spectra collected in the MFGM proteome. These data show that the milk exosome secretion pathway differs significantly from that of the MFGM in part due to the greatly reduced presence of MFGM proteins. The protein composition of milk exosomes provides new information on milk protein composition and the potential physiological significance of exosomes to mammary physiology.

Astrocytes secrete exosomes enriched with proapoptotic ceramide and prostate apoptosis response 4 (PAR-4): potential mechanism of apoptosis induction in Alzheimer disease (AD).	J Biol Chem	2012	Amyloid protein is well known to induce neuronal cell death, whereas only little is known about its effect on astrocytes. We found that amyloid peptides activated caspase 3 and induced apoptosis in primary cultured astrocytes, which was prevented by caspase 3 inhibition. Apoptosis was also prevented by shRNA-mediated down-regulation of PAR-4, a protein sensitizing cells to the sphingolipid ceramide. Consistent with a potentially proapoptotic effect of PAR-4 and ceramide, astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques in brain sections of the 5xFAD mouse (and Alzheimer disease patient brain) showed caspase 3 activation and were apoptotic when co-expressing PAR-4 and ceramide. Apoptosis was not observed in astrocytes with deficient neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), indicating that ceramide generated by nSMase2 is critical for amyloid-induced apoptosis. Antibodies against PAR-4 and ceramide prevented amyloid-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that apoptosis was mediated by exogenous PAR-4 and ceramide, potentially associated with secreted lipid vesicles. This was confirmed by the analysis of lipid vesicles from conditioned medium showing that amyloid peptide induced the secretion of PAR-4 and C18 ceramide-enriched exosomes. Exosomes were not secreted by nSMase2-deficient astrocytes, indicating that ceramide generated by nSMase2 is critical for exosome secretion. Consistent with the ceramide composition in amyloid-induced exosomes, exogenously added C18 ceramide restored PAR-4-containing exosome secretion in nSMase2-deficient astrocytes. Moreover, isolated PAR-4/ceramide-enriched exosomes were taken up by astrocytes and induced apoptosis in the absence of amyloid peptide. Taken together, we report a novel mechanism of apoptosis induction by PAR-4/ceramide-enriched exosomes, which may critically contribute to Alzheimer disease.	PMC3375560

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2012	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, 19-24 nucleotides in length, that regulate gene expression and are expressed aberrantly in most types of cancer. MiRNAs also have been detected in the blood of cancer patients and can serve as circulating biomarkers. It has been shown that secreted miRNAs within exosomes can be transferred from cell to cell and can regulate gene expression in the receiving cells by canonical binding to their target messenger RNAs. Here we show that tumor-secreted miR-21 and miR-29a also can function by another mechanism, by binding as ligands to receptors of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, murine TLR7 and human TLR8, in immune cells, triggering a TLR-mediated prometastatic inflammatory response that ultimately may lead to tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, by acting as paracrine agonists of TLRs, secreted miRNAs are key regulators of the tumor microenvironment. This mechanism of action of miRNAs is implicated in tumor-immune system communication and is important in tumor growth and spread, thus representing a possible target for cancer treatment.	PMC3412003

Systemically injected exosomes targeted to EGFR deliver antitumor microRNA to breast cancer cells.	Mol Ther	2013	Despite the therapeutic potential of nucleic acid drugs, their clinical application has been limited in part by a lack of appropriate delivery systems. Exosomes or microvesicles are small endosomally derived vesicles that are secreted by a variety of cell types and tissues. Here, we show that exosomes can efficiently deliver microRNA (miRNA) to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing breast cancer cells. Targeting was achieved by engineering the donor cells to express the transmembrane domain of platelet-derived growth factor receptor fused to the GE11 peptide. Intravenously injected exosomes delivered let-7a miRNA to EGFR-expressing xenograft breast cancer tissue in RAG2(-/-) mice. Our results suggest that exosomes can be used therapeutically to target EGFR-expressing cancerous tissues with nucleic acid drugs.	PMC3538304

Mol Biosyst	2013	Urinary exosomes (UE) are nanovesicles released by every epithelial cell facing the urinary space and they are considered a promising source of molecular markers for renal dysfunction and structural injury. Exosomal proteomics has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the molecular composition of exosomes and has potential to accelerate biomarker discovery. We employed this strategy in the study of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and the consequent end stage renal disease, which represent the dramatic evolution of diabetes, often leading the patients to dialysis or kidney transplantation. The identification of DN biomarkers is likely to help monitoring the disease onset and progression. A label free LC-MS/MS approach was applied to investigate the alteration of the proteome of urinary exosomes isolated from the Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF), as a model of type 2 DN. We collected 24 hour urine samples from 7 ZDF and from 7 control rats at different ages (6, 12 and 20 weeks old) to monitor the development of DN. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and their purity assessed by immunoblotting for known exosomal markers. Exosomal proteins from urine samples of 20 week old rats were pooled and analyzed by nLC-ESI-UHR-QToF-MS/MS after pre-filtration and tryptic digestion, leading to the identification and label free quantification of 286 proteins. Subcellular localization and molecular functions were assigned to each protein by UniprotKB, showing that the majority of identified proteins were membrane-associated or cytoplasmic and involved in transport, signalling and cellular adhesion, typical functions of exosomal proteins. We further validated label free mass spectrometry results by immunoblotting, as exemplified by: Xaa-Pro dipeptidase, Major Urinary Protein 1 and Neprilysin, which resulted increased, decreased and not different, respectively, in exosomes isolated from diabetic urine samples compared to controls, by both techniques. In conclusion we show the potential of exosome proteomics for DN biomarker discovery.

In-depth proteomic analyses of exosomes isolated from expressed prostatic secretions in urine.	Proteomics	2013	Expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) are proximal fluids of the prostate that are increasingly being utilized as a clinical source for diagnostic and prognostic assays for prostate cancer (PCa). These fluids contain an abundant amount of microvesicles reflecting the secretory function of the prostate gland, and their protein composition remains poorly defined in relation to PCa. Using expressed prostatic secretions in urine (EPS-urine), exosome preparations were characterized by a shotgun proteomics procedure. In pooled EPS-urine exosome samples, ~900 proteins were detected. Many of these have not been previously observed in the soluble proteome of EPS generated by our labs or other related exosome proteomes. We performed systematic comparisons of our data against previously published, prostate-related proteomes, and global annotation analyses to highlight functional processes within the proteome of EPS-urine derived exosomes. The acquired proteomic data have been deposited to the Tranche repository and will lay the foundation for more extensive investigations of PCa derived exosomes in the context of biomarker discovery and cancer biology.

The origin, function, and diagnostic potential of RNA within extracellular vesicles present in human biological fluids.	Front Genet	2013	We have previously demonstrated that tumor cells release membranous structures into their extracellular environment, which are termed exosomes, microvesicles or extracellular vesicles depending on specific characteristics, including size, composition and biogenesis pathway. These cell-derived vesicles can exhibit an array of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids derived from the originating tumor. This review focuses of the transcriptome (RNA) of these extracellular vesicles. Based on current data, these vesicular components play essential roles as conveyers of intercellular communication and mediators of many of the pathological conditions associated with cancer development, progression and therapeutic failures. These extracellular vesicles express components responsible for angiogenesis promotion, stromal remodeling, signal pathway activation through growth factor/receptor transfer, chemoresistance, and genetic exchange. These tumor-derived extracellular vesicles not only to represent a central mediator of the tumor microenvironment, but their presence in the peripheral circulation may serve as a surrogate for tumor biopsies, enabling real-time diagnosis and disease monitoring.

PLoS One	2013	Recent evidence indicates that regulatory small non-coding RNAs are not only components of eukaryotic cells and vesicles, but also reside within a number of different viruses including retroviral particles. Using ultra-deep sequencing we have comprehensively analyzed the content of simian immunodeficiency virions (SIV), which were compared to mock-control preparations. Our analysis revealed that more than 428,000 sequence reads matched the SIV mac239 genome sequence. Among these we could identify 12 virus-derived small RNAs (vsRNAs) that were highly abundant. Beside known retrovirus-enriched small RNAs, like 7SL-RNA, tRNA(Lys3) and tRNA(Lys) isoacceptors, we also identified defined fragments derived from small ILF3/NF90-associated RNA snaR-A14, that were enriched more than 50 fold in SIV. We also found evidence that small nucleolar RNAs U2 and U12 were underrepresented in the SIV preparation, indicating that the relative number or the content of co-isolated exosomes was changed upon infection. Our comprehensive atlas of SIV-incorporated small RNAs provides a refined picture of the composition of retrovirions, which gives novel insights into viral packaging.	PMC3781035

Tumour-derived exosomes as antigen delivery carriers in dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for malignant mesothelioma.	J Extracell Vesicles	2013	BACKGROUND: In 2001, it was postulated that tumour-derived exosomes could be a potent source of tumour-associated antigens (TAA). Since then, much knowledge is gained on their role in tumorigenesis but only very recently tumour-derived exosomes were used in dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy. For this, DCs were cultured ex-vivo and loaded with exosomes derived from immunogenic tumours such as melanoma or glioma and re-administrated to induce anti-tumour responses in primary and metastatic tumour mouse models. In contrast, malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a non-immunogenic tumour and because only a few mesothelioma-specific TAA are known to date, we investigated whether mesothelioma-derived exosomes could be used as antigen source in DC-based immunotherapy. METHODS: Mouse MM AB1 cells were used to generate tumour lysate and tumour-derived exosomes. Tumour lysate was generated by 5 cycles of freeze-thawing followed by sonication of AB1 cells. Tumour exosomes were collected from the AB1 cell culture supernatant and followed a stepwise ultracentrifugation. Protein quantification and electron microscopy were performed to determine the protein amount and to characterise their morphology. To test whether MM derived exosomes are immunogenic and able to stimulate an anti-tumoral response, BALB/c mice were injected with a lethal dose of AB1 tumour cells at day 0, followed by intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of DCs loaded with tumour exosomes, DCs loaded with tumour lysate, or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), at day 7. RESULTS: Mice which received tumour exosome-loaded DC immunotherapy had an increased median and overall survival compared to mice which received tumour lysate-loaded DC or PBS. CONCLUSION: In this study, we showed that DC immunotherapy loaded with tumour exosomes derived from non-immunogenic tumours improved survival of tumour bearing mice.	PMC3823268

PLoS One	2013	BACKGROUND: Current markers for prostate cancer, such as PSA lack specificity. Therefore, novel biomarkers are needed. Unfortunately, the complexity of body fluids often hampers biomarker discovery. An attractive alternative approach is the isolation of small vesicles, i.e. exosomes, ∼100 nm, which contain proteins that are specific to the tissue from which they are derived and therefore can be considered as treasure chests for disease-specific biomarker discovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from 2 immortalized primary prostate epithelial cells (PNT2C2 and RWPE-1) and 2 PCa cell lines (PC346C and VCaP) by ultracentrifugation. After tryptic digestion, proteomic analyses utilized a nanoLC coupled with an LTQ-Orbitrap operated in tandem MS (MS/MS) mode. Accurate Mass and Time (AMT) tag approach was employed for peptide identification and quantitation. Candidate biomarkers were validated by Western blotting and Immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Proteomic characterization resulted in the identification of 248, 233, 169, and 216 proteins by at least 2 peptides in exosomes from PNT2C2, RWPE-1, PC346C, and VCaP, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed 52 proteins differently abundant between PCa and control cells, 9 of which were more abundant in PCa. Validation by Western blotting confirmed a higher abundance of FASN, XPO1 and PDCD6IP (ALIX) in PCa exosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of exosomal proteins using high performance LC-FTMS resulted in the discovery of PDCD6IP, FASN, XPO1 and ENO1 as new candidate biomarkers for prostate cancer.	PMC3876995

Deregulated microRNAs in gastric cancer tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells: novel biomarkers and a mechanism for gastric cancer.	Br J Cancer	2014	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in gastric cancer development and progression. However, the expression and role of miRNAs in gastric cancer stromal cells are still unclear. METHODS: The miRNAs differentially expressed in gastric cancer tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (GC-MSCs) relative to adjacent non-cancerous tissue-derived MSCs (GCN-MSCs) and in cancer tissues relative to adjacent non-cancerous tissues were screened using miRNA microarray and validated by quantitative RT-PCR. The impact of GC-MSCs on HGC-27 cells was observed in vitro using colony formation and transwell assays, and these cells were subcutaneously co-injected into mice to assess tumour growth in vivo. Exogenous downregulation of miR-221 expression in cells was achieved using an miRNA inhibitor. RESULTS: miR-214, miR-221 and miR-222 were found to be commonly upregulated in GC-MSCs and cancer tissues. Their levels were tightly associated with lymph node metastasis, venous invasion and the TNM stage. Gastric cancer tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells significantly promoted HGC-27 growth and migration and increased the expression of miR-221 via paracrine secretion, and the targeted inhibition of miR-221 in GC-MSCs could block its tumour-supporting role. GC-MSC-derived exosomes were found to deliver miR-221 to HGC-27 cells and promoted their proliferation and migration. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric cancer tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells favour gastric cancer progression by transferring exosomal miRNAs to gastric cancer cells, thus providing a novel mechanism for the role of GC-MSCs and new biomarkers for gastric cancer.

J Am Soc Nephrol	2014	Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles, approximately 50 nm in diameter, derived from the endocytic pathway and released by a variety of cell types. Recent data indicate a spectrum of exosomal functions, including RNA transfer, antigen presentation, modulation of apoptosis, and shedding of obsolete protein. Exosomes derived from all nephron segments are also present in human urine, where their function is unknown. Although one report suggested in vitro uptake of exosomes by renal cortical collecting duct cells, most studies of human urinary exosomes have focused on biomarker discovery rather than exosome function. Here, we report results from in-depth proteomic analyses and EM showing that normal human urinary exosomes are significantly enriched for innate immune proteins that include antimicrobial proteins and peptides and bacterial and viral receptors. Urinary exosomes, but not the prevalent soluble urinary protein uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall protein), potently inhibited growth of pathogenic and commensal Escherichia coli and induced bacterial lysis. Bacterial killing depended on exosome structural integrity and occurred optimally at the acidic pH typical of urine from omnivorous humans. Thus, exosomes are innate immune effectors that contribute to host defense within the urinary tract.	PMC4147985

Interactions between exosomes from breast cancer cells and primary mammary epithelial cells leads to generation of reactive oxygen species which induce DNA damage response, stabilization of p53 and autophagy in epithelial cells.	PLoS One	2014	Exosomes are nanovesicles originating from multivesicular bodies and are released by all cell types. They contain proteins, lipids, microRNAs, mRNAs and DNA fragments, which act as mediators of intercellular communications by inducing phenotypic changes in recipient cells. Tumor-derived exosomes have been shown to play critical roles in different stages of tumor development and metastasis of almost all types of cancer. One of the ways by which exosomes affect tumorigenesis is to manipulate the tumor microenvironments to create tumor permissive "niches". Whether breast cancer cell secreted exosomes manipulate epithelial cells of the mammary duct to facilitate tumor development is not known. To address whether and how breast cancer cell secreted exosomes manipulate ductal epithelial cells we studied the interactions between exosomes isolated from conditioned media of 3 different breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, T47DA18 and MCF7), representing three different types of breast carcinomas, and normal human primary mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). Our studies show that exosomes released by breast cancer cell lines are taken up by HMECs, resulting in the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autophagy. Inhibition of ROS by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) led to abrogation of autophagy. HMEC-exosome interactions also induced the phosphorylation of ATM, H2AX and Chk1 indicating the induction of DNA damage repair (DDR) responses. Under these conditions, phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 was also observed. Both DDR responses and phosphorylation of p53 induced by HMEC-exosome interactions were also inhibited by NAC. Furthermore, exosome induced autophagic HMECs were found to release breast cancer cell growth promoting factors. Taken together, our results suggest novel mechanisms by which breast cancer cell secreted exosomes manipulate HMECs to create a tumor permissive microenvironment.	PMC4022578

Carcinogenesis	2014	The objective of this study was to analyze the expression, biological role and clinical relevance of exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) from ovarian carcinoma (OC) effusion supernatants. Exosomal miRNA expression profiling was performed using miRNA Taqman arrays. Selected miRNAs were validated using quantitative PCR in 86 OC effusion supernatants. The role of exosomal miRNA in this cancer was further studied using in vitro and in vivo models. miRNA profiling identified 99 miRNAs with high expression levels in exosomes from OC effusion supernatants. Quantitative PCR validation of 11 miRNAs showed significant associations with effusion site (peritoneum versus pleura) and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage. In univariate survival analysis, high levels of miRNAs 21, 23b and 29a were associated with poor progression-free survival (P = 0.01, P = 0.015 and P = 0.009, respectively), whereas high expression of miRNA 21 correlated with poor overall survival (P = 0.017). The latter association was retained in Cox multivariate analysis (P = 0.001). Exposure of LP9 mesothelial cells and ES2 OC cells to OC effusion-derived exosomes inhibited tumor spheroid expansion and reduced mesothelial clearance area. Treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency mice with exosomes from OC effusions prior to injection of tumor cells was associated with larger tumor load, more infiltrative tumors and shorter survival. Patient-derived OC effusion exosomes contain multiple miRNAs, of which some may have clinical relevance. In experimental models, OC exosomes affect both tumor cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment and induce more aggressive disease. Collectively, these data demonstrate the central role of miRNAs and their content in the biology of this cancer.

J Biol Chem	2014	Elevated levels of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in the human brain are linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that extracellular Aβ can bind to exosomes, which are cell-secreted nanovesicles with lipid membranes that are known to transport their cargos intercellularly. Such findings suggest that the exosomes are involved in Aβ metabolism in brain. Here, we found that neuroblastoma-derived exosomes exogenously injected into mouse brains trapped Aβ and with the associated Aβ were internalized into brain-resident phagocyte microglia. Accordingly, continuous intracerebral administration of the exosomes into amyloid-β precursor protein transgenic mice resulted in marked reductions in Aβ levels, amyloid depositions, and Aβ-mediated synaptotoxicity in the hippocampus. In addition, we determined that glycosphingolipids (GSLs), a group of membrane glycolipids, are highly abundant in the exosomes, and the enriched glycans of the GSLs are essential for Aβ binding and assembly on the exosomes both in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrate that intracerebrally administered exosomes can act as potent scavengers for Aβ by carrying it on the exosome surface GSLs and suggest a role of exosomes in Aβ clearance in the central nervous system. Improving Aβ clearance by exosome administration would provide a novel therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer disease.	PMC4148874

Extravillous trophoblast cells-derived exosomes promote vascular smooth muscle cell migration.	Front Pharmacol	2014	BACKGROUND: Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) migration is a critical process during human uterine spiral artery (SpA) remodeling and a successful pregnancy. Extravillous trophoblast cells (EVT) interact with VSMC and enhance their migration, however, the mechanisms by which EVT remodel SpA remain to be fully elucidated. We hypothesize that exosomes released from EVT promote VSMC migration. METHODS: JEG-3 and HTR-8/SVneo cell lines were used as models for EVT. Cells were cultured at 37°C and humidified under an atmosphere of 5% CO2-balanced N2 to obtain 8% O2. Cell-conditioned media were collected, and exosomes (exo-JEG-3 and exo- HTR-8/SVneo) isolated by differential and buoyant density centrifugation. The effects of exo-EVT on VSMC migration were established using a real-time, live-cell imaging system (Incucyte™). Exosomal proteins where identified by mass spectrometry and submitted to bioinformatic pathway analysis (Ingenuity software). RESULTS: HTR-8/SVneo cells were significantly more (~30%) invasive than JEG-3 cells. HTR-8/SVneo cells released 2.6-fold more exosomes (6.39 × 10(8) ± 2.5 × 10(8) particles/10(6) cells) compared to JEG-3 (2.86 × 10(8) ± 0.78 × 10(8) particles/10(6) cells). VSMC migration was significantly increased in the presence of exo-JEG-3 and exo-HTR-8/SVneo compared to control (-exosomes) (21.83 ± 0.49 h and 15.57 ± 0.32, respectively, vs. control 25.09 ± 0.58 h, p < 0.05). Sonication completely abolished the effect of exosomes on VSMC migration. Finally, mass spectrometry analysis identified unique exosomal proteins for each EVT cell line-derived exosomes. CONCLUSION: The data obtained in this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the release, content, and bioactivity of exosomes derived from EVT-like cell lines is cell origin-dependent and differentially regulates VSMC migration. Thus, an EVT exosomal signaling pathway may contribute to SpA remodeling by promoting the migration of VSMC out of the vessel walls.	PMC4128075

Development of glomerulus-, tubule-, and collecting duct-specific mRNA assay in human urinary exosomes and microvesicles.	PLoS One	2014	Urinary exosomes and microvesicles (EMV) are promising biomarkers for renal diseases. Although the density of EMV is very low in urine, large quantity of urine can be easily obtained. In order to analyze urinary EMV mRNA, a unique filter device to adsorb urinary EMV from 10 mL urine was developed, which is far more convenient than the standard ultracentrifugation protocol. The filter part of the device is detachable and aligned to a 96-well microplate format, therefore multiple samples can be processed simultaneously in a high throughput manner following the isolation step. For EMV mRNA quantification, the EMV on the filter is lysed directly by adding lysis buffer and transferred to an oligo(dT)-immobilized microplate for mRNA isolation followed by cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR. Under the optimized assay condition, our method provided comparable or even superior results to the standard ultracentrifugation method in terms of mRNA assay sensitivity, linearity, intra-assay reproducibility, and ease of use. The assay system was applied to quantification of kidney-specific mRNAs such as NPHN and PDCN (glomerular filtration), SLC12A1 (tubular absorption), UMOD and ALB (tubular secretion), and AQP2 (collecting duct water absorption). 12-hour urine samples were collected from four healthy subjects for two weeks, and day-to-day and individual-to-individual variations were investigated. Kidney-specific genes as well as control genes (GAPDH, ACTB, etc.) were successfully detected and confirmed their stable expressions through the two-week study period. In conclusion, this method is readily available to clinical studies of kidney diseases.	PMC4183527

Electronic address: .	stefan.duensing@med.uni.heidelberg.de		Identification of cell-free microRNAs in the urine of patients with prostate cancer.	Urol Oncol	2015	OBJECTIVES: Current methods for the early detection of prostate cancer (PCa), in particular prostate-specific antigen screening, are likely to benefit from complementary molecular analyses to enhance specificity. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small endogenously expressed noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of protein-coding genes at the transcriptional or translational level. Accumulating evidence suggests that miRNAs play an important role in tumorigenesis, are differentially expressed in different cancer types, and can be found in all bodily fluids so-far tested, including urine. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study was undertaken to determine if miRNA could be isolated from the cell-free fraction of freely voided urine of PCa patients and if a miRNA signature could be found that would identify patients with cancer. RESULTS: In a first set of proof-of-concept experiments, we isolated RNA from the supernatant of cultured PCa cells, as well as cellular RNA, and compared the expression of cell-free miRNAs vs. cellular miRNAs. We identified miRNA-483-5p, miRNA-1275, and miRNA-1290 among the most abundant cell-free miRNAs. We then tested the expression of these miRNAs in patient urine samples. A total of 18 patients without detectable PCa by transperineal template-saturation biopsy and 71 patients with diagnosed biopsy-proven PCa were retrospectively analyzed. We could confirm that cell-free miRNAs found in cultures of PCa cells can in fact be isolated from freely voided patients' urine. Furthermore, we found that patients with PCa express miR-483-5p in the cell-free urine fraction at a higher level than control patients do. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is among the first to show that miRNAs can be detected in the cell-free, non-exosome-enriched fraction of urine collected from patients with PCa. As the method used here does not require isolation of exosomes, it could potentially simplify the future use of miRNAs as urine-based biomarkers.

Perturbations in the urinary exosome in transplant rejection.	Front Med (Lausanne)	2014	BACKGROUND: Urine exosomes are small vesicles exocytosed into the urine by all renal epithelial cell types under normal physiologic and disease states. Urine exosomal proteins may mirror disease specific proteome perturbations in kidney injury. Analysis methodologies for the exosomal fraction of the urinary proteome were developed for comparing the urinary exosomal fraction versus unfractionated proteome for biomarker discovery. METHODS: Urine exosomes were isolated by centrifugal filtration of urine samples collected from kidney transplant patients with and without acute rejection (AR), which were biopsy matched. The proteomes of unfractionated whole urine (Uw) and urine exosomes (Ue) underwent mass spectroscopy-based quantitative proteomics analysis. The proteome data were analyzed for significant differential protein abundances in AR. RESULTS: A total of 1018 proteins were identified in Uw and 349 proteins in Ue. Two hundred seventy-nine overlapped between the two urinary compartments and 70 proteins were unique to the Ue compartment. Of 349 exosomal proteins identified from transplant patients, 220 had not been previously identified in the normal Ue fraction. Eleven Ue proteins, functionally involved in an inflammatory and stress response, were more abundant in urine samples from patients with AR, three of which are exclusive to the Ue fraction. Ue AR-specific biomarkers (1) were also detected in Uw, but since they were observed at significantly lower abundances in Uw, they were not significant for AR in Uw. CONCLUSION: A rapid urinary exosome isolation method and quantitative measurement of enriched Ue proteins was applied. Perturbed proteins in the exosomal compartment of urine collected from kidney transplant patients were specific to inflammatory responses, and were not observed in the Ue fraction from normal healthy subjects. Ue-specific protein alterations in renal disease provide potential mechanistic insights and offer a unique panel of sensitive biomarkers for monitoring AR.	PMC4292055

Human thymic epithelial primary cells produce exosomes carrying tissue-restricted antigens.	Immunol Cell Biol	2015	Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles released by cells into the extracellular space and have been shown to be present in thymic tissue both in mice and in humans. The source of thymic exosomes is however still an enigma and hence it is not known whether thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are able to produce exosomes. In this work, we have cultured human TECs and isolated exosomes. These exosomes carry tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs), for example, myelin basic protein and desmoglein 3. The presence of TRAs indicates a possible role for thymic epithelium-derived exosomes in the selection process of thymocytes. The key contribution of these exosomes could be to disseminate self-antigens from the thymic epithelia, thus making them more accessible to the pool of maturing thymocytes. This would increase the coverage of TRAs within the thymus, and facilitate the process of positive and negative selection.	PMC4575951

Circ Res	2015	RATIONALE: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) hold great promise for cardiac regeneration but are susceptible to various concerns. Recently, salutary effects of stem cells have been connected to exosome secretion. ESCs have the ability to produce exosomes, however, their effect in the context of the heart is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Determine the effect of ESC-derived exosome for the repair of ischemic myocardium and whether c-kit(+) cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) function can be enhanced with ESC exosomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study demonstrates that mouse ESC-derived exosomes (mES Ex) possess ability to augment function in infarcted hearts. mES Ex enhanced neovascularization, cardiomyocyte survival, and reduced fibrosis post infarction consistent with resurgence of cardiac proliferative response. Importantly, mES Ex augmented CPC survival, proliferation, and cardiac commitment concurrent with increased c-kit(+) CPCs in vivo 8 weeks after in vivo transfer along with formation of bonafide new cardiomyocytes in the ischemic heart. miRNA array revealed significant enrichment of miR290-295 cluster and particularly miR-294 in ESC exosomes. The underlying basis for the beneficial effect of mES Ex was tied to delivery of ESC specific miR-294 to CPCs promoting increased survival, cell cycle progression, and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: mES Ex provide a novel cell-free system that uses the immense regenerative power of ES cells while avoiding the risks associated with direct ES or ES-derived cell transplantation and risk of teratomas. ESC exosomes possess cardiac regeneration ability and modulate both cardiomyocyte and CPC-based repair programs in the heart.	PMC4482130

CD97 promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion through exosome-mediated MAPK signaling pathway.	World J Gastroenterol	2015	AIM: To investigate the mechanism underlying the promoting role of CD97 in gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion. METHODS: Two types of exosomes released by gastric cancer cells with high (SGC/wt) or low (SGC/kd) CD97 expression were isolated by ultracentrifugation and identified by electron microscopy and western blot analysis. The influences of the two exosomes on gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion were investigated by proliferation and Matrigel invasion assays. Exosomal miRNAs were subsequently isolated from the two samples and their miRNA profiles were compared via microarray assay analysis. Reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the microarray assay. Target genes of the differently expressed microRNAs were predicted based on five independent algorithms and were then subjected to gene oncology enrichment and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. After identifying the pathway that was the most likely altered, tumor cells were treated with the two exosomes at different concentrations, and the pathway activation was identified through western blot analysis. RESULTS: Exosomes isolated from SGC/wt cells significantly promoted tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. SGC/wt exosomes also significantly elevated the invasiveness of both SGC/wt (129.67 ± 8.327 vs 76.00 ± 5.292, P < 0.001) and SGC/kd (114.52 ± 9.814 vs 45.73 ± 4.835, P < 0.001) cells as compared to the exosomes released by SGC/kd cells. Microarray assay of the two exosomes revealed that 62 miRNAs were differently regulated with a signal intensity of > 500 and a false discovery rate < 0.05. The following KEGG analysis defined the MAPK signaling pathway as the most likely candidate pathway that regulated tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Through western blot analysis, significant up-regulations of phosphorylated MAPKs, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, were detected in a dose-dependent manner in the SGC/wt exosomes treated groups, confirming activation of the MAPK signaling pathway stimulated by SGC/wt exosomes. CONCLUSION: CD97 promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion in vitro through exosome-mediated MAPK signaling pathway, and exosomal miRNAs are probably involved in activation of the CD97-associated pathway.

Improved Structure and Function in Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Rat Kidneys with Renal Tubular Cell Therapy.	PLoS One	2015	Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is a truly catastrophic monogenetic disease, causing death and end stage renal disease in neonates and children. Using PCK female rats, an orthologous model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease harboring mutant Pkhd1, we tested the hypothesis that intravenous renal cell transplantation with normal Sprague Dawley male kidney cells would improve the polycystic kidney disease phenotype. Cytotherapy with renal cells expressing wild type Pkhd1 and tubulogenic serum amyloid A1 had powerful and sustained beneficial effects on renal function and structure in the polycystic kidney disease model. Donor cell engraftment and both mutant and wild type Pkhd1 were found in treated but not control PCK kidneys 15 weeks after the final cell infusion. To examine the mechanisms of global protection with a small number of transplanted cells, we tested the hypothesis that exosomes derived from normal Sprague Dawley cells can limit the cystic phenotype of PCK recipient cells. We found that renal exosomes originating from normal Sprague Dawley cells carried and transferred wild type Pkhd1 mRNA to PCK cells in vivo and in vitro and restricted cyst formation by cultured PCK cells. The results indicate that transplantation with renal cells containing wild type Pkhd1 improves renal structure and function in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease and may provide an intra-renal supply of normal Pkhd1 mRNA.

J Virol Methods	2015	Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important swine disease. As part of the development of RNA interference (RNAi) strategy against the disease, in this study a recombinant adenovirus (rAd) expressing the artificial microRNA (amiRNA) targeting the 3' untranslated region (UTR) was used to investigate the exosome-mediated amiRNA transfer from different pig cell types to porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the sequence-specific amiRNA was expressed in and secreted via exosomes from the rAd-transduced pig kidney cell line PK-15, PAM cell line 3D4/163, kidney fibroblast cells (PFCs) and endometrial endothelial cells (PEECs) with different secretion efficiencies. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that the dye-labeled amiRNA-containing exosomes of different cell origins were efficiently taken up by all of the five types of pig cells tested, including primary PAMs. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the amiRNA-containing exosomes of different cell origins were taken up by primary PAMs in both time- and dose-dependent manners. Both quantitative RT-PCR and viral titration assays showed that the exosome-delivered amiRNA had potent anti-viral effects against three different PRRSV strains. These data suggest that the exosomes derived from pig cells could serve as an efficient miRNA transfer vehicle, and that the exosome-delivered amiRNA had potent anti-viral effects against different PRRSV strains.

J Transl Med	2015	BACKGROUND: Within the last few years, it has become evident that LPS-preconditioned mesenchymal stromal cells (LPS pre-MSCs) show enhanced paracrine effects, including increased trophic support and improved regenerative and repair properties. MSCs may release large amounts of exosomes for cell-to-cell communication and maintain a dynamic and homeostatic microenvironment for tissue repair. The present study assesses the therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of LPS-preconditioned MSC-derived exosomes (LPS pre-Exo) for chronic inflammation and wound healing. METHODS: We extracted exosomes from the supernatant of LPS pre-MSCs using a gradient centrifugation method. In vitro, THP-1 cells were cultured with high glucose (HG, 30 mM) as an inflammatory model and treated with LPS pre-Exo for 48 h. The expression of inflammation-related cytokines was detected by real-time RT-PCR, and the distribution of macrophage subtype was measured by immunofluorescence. Next, the miRNA expression profiles of LPS pre-Exo were evaluated using miRNA microarray analysis. The molecular signaling pathway responsible for the regenerative potential was identified by western blotting. In vivo, we established a cutaneous wound model in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, and LPS pre-Exo were injected dispersively into the wound edge. The curative effects of LPS pre-Exo on inflammation and wound healing were observed and evaluated. RESULTS: LPS pre-Exo have a better ability than untreated MSC-derived exosomes (un-Exo) to modulate the balance of macrophages due to their upregulation of the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and promotion of M2 macrophage activation. Microarray analysis of LPS pre-Exo identified the unique expression of let-7b compared with un-Exo, and the let-7b/TLR4 pathway served as potential contributor to macrophage polarization and inflammatory ablation. Further investigation of the mechanisms that control let-7b expression demonstrated that a TLR4/NF-κB/STAT3/AKT regulatory signaling pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of macrophage plasticity. Knockdown of AKT in THP-1 cells similarly abolished the immunomodulatory effect of LPS pre-Exo. In vivo, LPS pre-Exo greatly alleviated inflammation and enhanced diabetic cutaneous wound healing. CONCLUSION: LPS pre-Exo may have improved regulatory abilities for macrophage polarization and resolution of chronic inflammation by shuttling let-7b, and these exosomes carry much immunotherapeutic potential for wound healing.

Altered microRNA profiles in cerebrospinal fluid exosome in Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease.	Oncotarget	2015	The differential diagnosis of Parkinson's diseases (PD) is challenging, especially in the early stages of the disease. We developed a microRNA profiling strategy for exosomal miRNAs isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in PD and AD. Sixteen exosomal miRNAs were up regulated and 11 miRNAs were under regulated significantly in PD CSF when compared with those in healthy controls (relative fold > 2, p < 0.05). MiR-1 and miR-19b-3p were validated and significantly reduced in independent samples. While miR-153, miR-409-3p, miR-10a-5p, and let-7g-3p were significantly over expressed in PD CSF exosome. Bioinformatic analysis by DIANA-mirPath demonstrated that Neurotrophin signaling, mTOR signaling, Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, Dopaminergic synapse, and Glutamatergic synapse were the most prominent pathways enriched in quantiles with PD miRNA patterns. Messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts [amyloid precursor protein (APP), α-synuclein (α-syn), Tau, neurofilament light gene (NF-L), DJ-1/PARK7, Fractalkine and Neurosin] and long non-coding RNAs (RP11-462G22.1 and PCA3) were differentially expressed in CSF exosomes in PD and AD patients. These data demonstrated that CSF exosomal RNA molecules are reliable biomarkers with fair robustness in regard to specificity and sensitivity in differentiating PD from healthy and diseased (AD) controls.

Roll over Weismann: extracellular vesicles in the transgenerational transmission of environmental effects.	Epigenomics	2015	The ability of environmental exposures to induce phenotypic change across multiple generations of offspring has gathered an enormous amount of interest in recent years. There are by now many examples of nongenetic transgenerational effects of environmental exposures, covering a broad range of stressors. Available evidence indicates that epigenetic inheritance may mediate at least some of these transgenerational effects, but how environmental exposures induce changes to the epigenome of the germline is unknown. One possibility is that exposed somatic cells can communicate their exposures to the germline to induce a stable change. In this Perspective, we propose that extracellular vesicles shed by somatic cells represent a credible means by which environmental experience could effect a transmissible epigenetic change in the germline, leading to the inheritance of acquired traits.

Exp Cell Res	2016	Therapeutic strategies for the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have not yet provided satisfactory results. Interest in stem cells for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing and their beneficial action seems to be due to a paracrine effect via the release of exosomes, main mediators of cell-cell communication. Here we wished to assess, in vitro, the efficacy of a novel non-cell therapeutic approach based on the use of exosomes derived from murine adipose-derived stromal cells on motoneuron-like NSC-34 cells expressing ALS mutations, and used as in vitro models of disease. In particular, we set out to investigate the effect of exosomes on NSC-34 naïve cells and NSC-34 cells overexpressing human SOD1(G93A) or SOD1(G37R) or SOD1(A4V) mutants, exposed to oxidative stress. The data presented here indicate for the first time that exosomes (0.2 µg/ml) are able to protect NSC-34 cells from oxidative damage, which is one of the main mechanism of damage in ALS, increasing cell viability. These data highlight a promising role of exosomes derived from stem cells for potential therapeutic applications in motoneuron disease.

Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol	2016	OBJECTIVE: Literature on the effect of cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EV), ≤1 μm vesicles shed from various cell types during activation or apoptosis, on microvascular endothelial cell (MVEC) signaling is conflicting. Thrombospondin-1 and related proteins induce anti-angiogenic signals in MVEC via CD36. CD36 binds EV via phosphatidylserine exposed on their surface but the effects of this interaction on MVEC functions are not known. We hypothesized that EV would inhibit angiogenic MVEC functions via CD36. APPROACH AND RESULTS: EV generated in vitro from various cell types or isolated from plasma inhibited MVEC tube formation in in vitro matrigel assays and endothelial cell migration in Boyden chamber assays. Exosomes derived from the same cells did not have inhibitory activity. Inhibition of migration required endothelial cell expression of CD36. In mouse in vivo matrigel plug assays, EV inhibited cell migration into matrigel plugs in wild type but not in cd36 null animals. Annexin V, an anionic phospholipid binding protein, when incubated with EV partially reversed inhibition of migration, suggesting a phosphatidylserine-dependent effect. EV exposure induced reactive oxygen species generation in MVEC in a NADPH oxidase and Src family kinase-dependent manner, and their inhibition by apocynin and PP2, respectively, partially reversed the EV-mediated inhibition of migration. Annexin V partially reversed EV-induced reactive oxygen species generation in murine CD36 cDNA-transfected HVUEC but not in CD36-negative human umbilical vein endothelial cell. CONCLUSIONS: These studies establish a general inhibitory effect of EV on endothelial cell proangiogenic responses and identify a CD36-mediated mechanistic pathway through which EV inhibit MVEC migration and tube formation.

J Alzheimers Dis	2016	BACKGROUND: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a tauopathy associated with prior exposure to repetitive head impacts, such as those incurred through American football and other collision sports. Diagnosis is made through neuropathological examination. Many of the clinical features of CTE are common in the general population, with and without a history of head impact exposure, making clinical diagnosis difficult. As is now common in the diagnosis of other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, there is a need for methods to diagnose CTE during life through objective biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine tau-positive exosomes in plasma as a potential CTE biomarker. METHODS: Subjects were 78 former National Football League (NFL) players and 16 controls. Extracellular vesicles were isolated from plasma. Fluorescent nanoparticle tracking analysis was used to determine the number of vesicles staining positive for tau. RESULTS: The NFL group had higher exosomal tau than the control group (p < 0.0001). Exosomal tau discriminated between the groups, with 82% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, and 53% negative predictive value. Within the NFL group, higher exosomal tau was associated with worse performance on tests of memory (p = 0.0126) and psychomotor speed (p = 0.0093). CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings suggest that exosomal tau in plasma may be an accurate, noninvasive CTE biomarker.	PMC4833534

Environmental Enrichment Stimulates Immune Cell Secretion of Exosomes that Promote CNS Myelination and May Regulate Inflammation.	Cell Mol Neurobiol	2016	Environmental enrichment (EE) consists of increased physical, intellectual, and social activity, and has wide-ranging effects, including enhancing cognition, learning and memory, and motor coordination. Animal studies have demonstrated that EE improves outcome of brain trauma and neurodegenerative disorders, including demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, making it a promising therapeutic option. However, the complexity of applying a robust EE paradigm makes clinical use difficult. A better understanding of the signaling involved in EE-based neuroprotection may allow for development of effective mimetics as an alternative. In prior work, we found that exosomes isolated from the serum of rats exposed to EE impact CNS myelination. Exosomes are naturally occurring nanovesicles containing mRNA, miRNA, and protein, which play important roles in cell function, disease, and immunomodulation. When applied to hippocampal slice cultures or nasally administered to naïve rats, EE-serum exosomes significantly increase myelin content, oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) and neural stem cell levels, and reduce oxidative stress (OS). We found that rat EE exosomes were enriched in miR-219, which is necessary and sufficient for OPC differentiation into myelinating cells. Thus, peripherally produced exosomes may be a useful therapy for remyelination. Here, we aim to better characterize the impact of EE on CNS health and to determine the cellular source of nutritive exosomes found in serum. We found that exosomes isolated from various circulating immune cell types all increased slice culture myelin content, contained miR-219, and reduced OS, suggesting that EE globally alters immune function in a way that supports brain health.

J Hematol Oncol	2016	BACKGROUND: In tumor microenvironment, a continuous cross-talk between cancer cells and other cellular components is required to sustain tumor progression. Accumulating evidence suggests that exosomes, a novel way of cell communication, play an important role in such cross-talk. Exosomes could facilitate the direct intercellular transfer of proteins, lipids, and miRNA/mRNA/DNAs between cells. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be attracted to tumor sites and become an important component of the tumor microenvironment, there is an urgent need to reveal the effect of tumor exosomes on MSCs and to further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Exosomes were harvested from lung cancer cell line A549 and added to MSCs. Secretion of inflammation-associated cytokines in exosome-treated MSCs were analyzed by RT-PCR and ELISA. The growth-promoting effect of exosome-treated MSCs on lung tumor cells was evaluated by in vivo mouse xenograft model. Signaling pathway involved in exosomes-treated MSCs was detected by PCR array of human toll-like receptor signaling pathway, RT-PCR, and Western blot. RESULTS: Data showed that lung tumor cell A549-derived exosomes could induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype in MSCs named P-MSCs, which have significantly elevated secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. P-MSCs possess a greatly enhanced ability in promoting lung tumor growth in mouse xenograft model. Analysis of the signaling pathways in P-MSCs revealed a fast triggering of NF-κB. Genetic ablation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) by siRNA and TLR2-neutralizing antibody could block NF-κB activation by exosomes. We further found that Hsp70 present on the surface of lung tumor exosomes contributed to the induction of P-MSCs by A549 exosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies suggest a novel mechanism by which lung tumor cell-derived exosomes induce pro-inflammatory activity of MSCs which in turn get tumor supportive characteristics.	PMC4836087

Tumour Biol	2016	Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common endocrine malignancy and its incidence has increased over the last few decades. As has been revealed by a number of studies, TC tissue's micro-RNA (miRNA) profile may reflect histological features and the clinical behavior of tumor. However, alteration of the miRNA profile of plasma exosomes associated with TC development has to date not been explored. We isolated exosomes from plasma and assayed their characteristics using laser diffraction particle size analysis, atomic force microscopy, and western blotting. Next, we profiled cancer-associated miRNAs in plasma exosomes obtained from papillary TC patients, before and after surgical removal of the tumor. The diagnostic value of selected miRNAs was evaluated in a large cohort of patients displaying different statuses of thyroid nodule disease. MiRNA assessment was performed by RT-qPCR. In total, 60 patients with different types of thyroid nodal pathology were included in the study. Our results revealed that the development of papillary TC is associated with specific changes in exosomal miRNA profiles; this phenomenon can be used for differential diagnostics. MiRNA-31 was found to be over-represented in the plasma exosomes of patients with papillary TC vs. benign tumors, while miRNA-21 helped to distinguish between benign tumors and follicular TC. MiRNA-21 and MiRNA-181a-5p were found to be expressed reciprocally in the exosomes of patients with papillary and follicular TC, and their comparative assessment may help to distinguish between these types of TC with 100 % sensitivity and 77 % specificity.

J Diabetes Complications	2016	AIMS: Wound healing is deeply dependent on neovascularization to restore blood flow. The neovascularization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) through paracrine secretion has been reported in various tissue repair models. Exosomes, key components of cell paracrine mechanism, have been rarely reported in wound healing. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from the media of EPCs obtained from human umbilical cord blood. Diabetic rats wound model was established and treated with exosomes. The in vitro effects of exosomes on the proliferation, migration and angiogenic tubule formation of endothelial cells were investigated. RESULTS: We revealed that human umbilical cord blood EPCs derived exosomes transplantation could accelerate cutaneous wound healing in diabetic rats. We also showed that exosomes enhanced the proliferation, migration and tube formation of vascular endothelial cells in vitro. Furthermore, we found that endothelial cells stimulated with these exosomes would increase expression of angiogenesis-related molecules, including FGF-1, VEGFA, VEGFR-2, ANG-1, E-selectin, CXCL-16, eNOS and IL-8. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings indicated that EPCs-derived exosomes facilitate wound healing by positively modulating vascular endothelial cells function.

Foetal bovine serum-derived exosomes affect yield and phenotype of human cardiac progenitor cell culture.	Bioimpacts	2016	INTRODUCTION: Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) represent a powerful tool in cardiac regenerative medicine. Pre-clinical studies suggest that most of the beneficial effects promoted by the injected cells are due to their paracrine activity exerted on endogenous cells and tissue. Exosomes are candidate mediators of this paracrine effects. According to their potential, many researchers have focused on characterizing exosomes derived from specific cell types, but, up until now, only few studies have analyzed the possible in vitro effects of bovine serum-derived exosomes on cell proliferation or differentiation. METHODS: The aim of this study was to analyse, from a qualitative and quantitative point of view, the in vitro effects of bovine serum exosomes on human CPCs cultured either as cardiospheres or as monolayers of cardiosphere-forming cells. RESULTS: Effects on proliferation, yield and molecular patterning were detected. We show, for the first time, that exogenous bovine exosomes support the proliferation and migration of human cardiosphere-forming cells, and that their depletion affects cardiospheres formation, in terms of size, yield and extra-cellular matrix production. CONCLUSION: These results stress the importance of considering differential biological effects of exogenous cell culture supplements on the final phenotype of primary human cell cultures.	PMC4916547

J Biol Chem	2016	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles (MVs), have emerged as a major form of intercellular communication, playing important roles in several physiological processes and diseases, including cancer. EVs generated by cancer cells contain a variety of proteins and RNA species that can be transferred between cancer cells as well as between cancer and non-transformed (normal) cells, thereby impacting a number of aspects of cancer progression. Here we show how oncogenic transformation influences the biogenesis and function of EVs using a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that can be induced to express an oncogenic form of diffuse B cell lymphoma (Dbl). Although MEFs induced to express onco-Dbl generated a similar amount of MVs as uninduced control cells, we found that MVs isolated from onco-Dbl-transformed cells contain a unique signaling protein, the ubiquitously expressed non-receptor tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase. The addition of MVs isolated from MEFs expressing onco-Dbl to cultures of fibroblasts strongly promoted their survival and induced their ability to grow under anchorage-independent conditions, outcomes that could be reversed by knocking down focal adhesion kinase and depleting it from the MVs or by inhibiting its kinase activity using a specific inhibitor. We then showed the same to be true for MVs isolated from aggressive MDAMB231 breast cancer cells. Together, these findings demonstrate that the induction of oncogenic transformation gives rise to MVs, which uniquely contain a signaling protein kinase that helps propagate the transformed phenotype and thus may offer a specific diagnostic marker of malignant disease.

Front Immunol	2016	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are specifically loaded with nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins from their parental cell. Therefore, the constitution of EVs reflects the type and status of the originating cell and EVs in melanoma patient's plasma could be indicative for the tumor. Likewise, EVs might influence tumor progression by regulating immune responses. We performed a broad protein characterization of EVs from plasma of melanoma patients and healthy donors as well as from T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), and platelets using a multiplex bead-based platform. Using this method, we succeeded in analyzing 58 proteins that were differentially displayed on EVs. Hierarchical clustering of protein intensity patterns grouped EVs according to their originating cell type. The analysis of EVs from stimulated B cells and moDCs revealed the transfer of surface proteins to vesicles depending on the cell status. The protein profiles of plasma vesicles resembled the protein profiles of EVs from platelets, antigen-presenting cells and NK cells as shown by platelet markers, co-stimulatory proteins, and a NK cell subpopulation marker. In comparison to healthy plasma vesicles, melanoma plasma vesicles showed altered signals for platelet markers, indicating a changed vesicle secretion or protein loading of EVs by platelets and a lower CD8 signal that might be associated with a diminished activity of NK cells or T cells. As we hardly detected melanoma-derived vesicles in patient's plasma, we concluded that blood cells induced the observed differences. In summary, our results question a direct effect of melanoma cells on the composition of EVs in melanoma plasma, but rather argue for an indirect influence of melanoma cells on the vesicle secretion or vesicle protein loading by blood cells.

Quantification of plasma exosome is a potential prognostic marker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	Oncol Rep	2016	Exosomes play important roles in cancer progression. Although its contents (e.g., proteins and microRNAs) have been focused on in cancer research, particularly as potential diagnostic markers, the exosome behavior and methods for exosome quantification remain unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the tumor-derived exosome behavior and assessed the quantification of exosomes in patient plasma as a biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). A CD63-GFP expressing human ESCC cell line (TE2-CD63-GFP) was made by transfection, and mouse subcutaneous tumor models were established. Fluorescence imaging was performed on tumors and plasma exosomes harvested from mice. GFP-positive small vesicles were confirmed in the plasma obtained from TE2-CD63-GFP tumor-bearing mice. Patient plasma was collected in Chiba University Hospital (n=86). Exosomes were extracted from 100 µl of the plasma and quantified by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. The relationship between exosome quantification and the patient clinical characteristics was assessed. The quantification of exosomes isolated from the patient plasma revealed that esophageal cancer patients (n=66) expressed higher exosome levels than non-malignant patients (n=20) (P=0.0002). Although there was no correlation between the tumor progression and the exosome levels, exosome number was the independent prognostic marker and low levels of exosome predicted a poor prognosis (P=0.03). In conclusion, exosome levels may be useful as an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients.	PMC5055211

J Bone Miner Res	2017	Articular bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is mediated by the interaction between inflammation and pathways regulating bone metabolism. Inflammation promotes osteoclastogenesis and also inhibits osteoblast function, further contributing to the persistence of erosions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of skeletal remodeling and play a role in RA pathogenesis. We therefore determined the expression of miRNAs in inflamed synovial tissue and the role they play in pathways regulating osteoblast and osteoclast function. Using the serum transfer mouse model of RA in C57BL/6 mice, we performed Fluidigm high-throughput qPCR-based screening of miRNAs from nonarthritic and arthritic mice. Global gene expression profiling was also performed on Affymetrix microarrays from these same synovial samples. miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were subjected to comparative bioinformatics. A total of 536 upregulated genes and 417 downregulated genes were identified that are predicted targets of miRNAs with reciprocal expression changes. Gene ontology analysis of these genes revealed significant enrichment in skeletal pathways. Of the 22 miRNAs whose expression was most significantly changed (p < 0.01) between nonarthritic and arthritic mice, we identified their targets that both inhibit and promote bone formation. These miRNAs are predicted to target Wnt and BMP signaling pathway components. We validated miRNA array findings and demonstrated that secretion of miR-221-3p in exosomes was upregulated by synovial fibroblasts treated with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF. Overexpression of miR-221-3p suppressed calvarial osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in vitro. These results suggest that miRNAs derived from inflamed synovial tissues may regulate signaling pathways at erosion sites that affect bone loss and potentially also compensatory bone formation. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Mechanism of Fibronectin Binding to Human Trabecular Meshwork Exosomes and Its Modulation by Dexamethasone.	PLoS One	2016	Exosomes are emerging as important mediators of cell-matrix interactions by means of specific adhesion proteins. Changes in the tissue-specific exosomal protein expression may underlie pathological conditions whereby extracellular matrix turnover and homeostasis is disrupted. Ocular hypertension due to extracellular matrix accumulation in the trabecular meshwork is a hallmark of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma. In the trabecular meshwork, exosomal fibronectin mediates cell matrix interactions at cellular structures called "invadosomes". Trabecular meshwork cells use invadosomes to turn over their surrounding matrix and maintain passageways for flow of aqueous humor. In this study, we observed that human trabecular meshwork explants treated with dexamethasone released exosomes with significantly reduced amounts of fibronectin bound per exosome. Further, we found that exosome-fibronectin binding is heparan sulfate-dependent, consistent with our observation that trabecular meshwork exosomes are enriched in the heparin/heparan sulfate binding annexins A2 and A6. In this way, dexamethasone-treated explants released exosomes with a significant reduction in annexin A2 and A6 per exosome. Interestingly, we did not detect exosomal matrix metalloproteinases, but we identified abundant dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a serine protease whose activity was reduced on exosomes isolated from dexamethasone-treated explants. Together, our findings demonstrate mechanistically how corticosteroid-induced alterations in exosomal adhesion cargo and properties can account for the pathological matrix accumulation seen in many glaucoma patients.

Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol	2017	Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted by cells and contain various molecules including protein, lipid, and DNA/RNA. They are crucial mediators of the intercellular communication and serve as promising vehicles for drug delivery and gene therapy. Recently, accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) may serve as new and potentially powerful targets for therapeutic interventions against various human diseases. However, steadily and effectively delivering miRNA mimics or inhibitors to target cells remains a major obstacle. To enhance the efficacy of exosome-mediated delivery of miRNA molecules, it is crucial to develop a convenient and efficient method to enrich specific miRNAs or antisense oligos in isolated exosomes. Here we report a novel method to prepare specific miRNA molecule-loaded exosomes. Using a modified calcium chloride-mediated transfection method, we successfully enhanced the designated miRNA mimics or inhibitors in isolated exosomes directly, instead of transfecting their mother cells. We also compared this method with direct transfection of exosomes using electroporation. Both methods confirmed that exosomes can serve as cargos to deliver a robustly increased amount of selected miRNA mimic(s) or inhibitor(s) to the recipient cells. Delivery of these miRNA molecule enriched-exosomes subsequently results in highly efficient overexpression or deletion of the designated miRNAs in the recipient cells both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, we confirmed that exosome-delivered miRNA mimics or inhibitors are functional in the recipient cells. Collectively, we developed a novel protocol to conveniently manipulate exosomal miRNAs with high efficiency and successfully deliver the exosomal miRNA molecules to recipient cells.	PMC5283929

Exosome-Mediated Telomere Instability in Human Breast Epithelial Cancer Cells after X Irradiation.	Radiat Res	2017	In directly irradiating cells, telomere metabolism is altered and similar effects have been observed in nontargeted cells. Exosomes and their cargo play dominant roles in communicating radiation-induced bystander effects with end points related to DNA damage. Here we report novel evidence that exosomes are also responsible for inducing telomere-related bystander effects. Breast epithelial cancer cells were exposed to either 2 Gy X rays, or exposed to irradiated cell conditioned media (ICCM), or exosomes purified from ICCM. Compared to control cells, telomerase activity decreased in the 2 Gy irradiated cells and both bystander samples after one population doubling. At the first population doubling, telomere length was shorter in the 2 Gy irradiated sample but not in the bystander samples. By 24 population doublings telomerase activity recovered to control levels in all samples; however, the 2 Gy irradiated sample continued to demonstrate short telomeres and both bystander samples acquired shorter telomeres. RNase treatment of exosomes prevented the bystander effects on telomerase and telomere length that were observed at 1 population doubling and 24 population doublings, respectively. Thermal denaturation by boiling eliminated the reduction of telomere length in bystander samples, suggesting that the protein fraction of exosomes also contributes to the telomeric effect. RNase treatment plus boiling abrogated all telomere-related effects in directly irradiated and bystander cell populations. These findings suggest that both proteins and RNAs of exosomes can induce alterations in telomeric metabolism, which can instigate genomic instability in epithelial cancer cells after X-ray irradiation.

Exosomes Derived from Human Pulmonary Artery Endothelial Cells Shift the Balance between Proliferation and Apoptosis of Smooth Muscle Cells.	Cardiology	2017	BACKGROUND: The overproliferation of pulmonary vascular cells is noted in pulmonary hypertension. The role of exosomes from pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) in the proliferation and apoptosis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) remains unclear. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated and purified from the culture medium of PAEC using a commercial kit. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia, and hydrogen peroxide were utilized to induce PAEC injury. Coculture of PAEC and PASMC was conducted using Transwell plates, and GW4869 was applied to inhibit exosome release. The proliferation and apoptosis level of PASMC was assayed by MTT assay, apoptosis staining, and cleaved caspase-3 immunoblotting. Plasma exosomes were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation. RESULTS: LPS or hypoxia enhance exosome release from PAEC. Release of PAEC-derived exosomes positively correlates with LPS concentration. The coculture of LPS-disposed PAEC with PASMC leads to overproliferation and apoptosis resistance in PASMC, and the exosome inhibitor GW4869 can partly cancel out this effect. Exosomes derived from PAEC could be internalized into PASMC, and thus promote proliferation and induce apoptosis resistance in PASMC. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension patients exhibit a higher circulation level of endothelium-derived exosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation and hypoxia could induce PAEC to release exosomes. PAEC- derived exosomes are involved in overproliferation and apoptosis resistance in PASMC, by which they may contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension.

J Immunol	2017	Monocytes and macrophages (MΦs) play a central role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The tissue microenvironment triggers monocyte differentiation into MΦs, with polarization ranging within the spectrum of M1 (classical) to M2 (alternative) activation. Recently, we demonstrated that HCV infection leads to monocyte differentiation into polarized MΦs that mediate stellate cell activation via TGF-β. In this study, we aimed to identify the viral factor(s) that mediate monocyte-to-MΦ differentiation. We performed coculture experiments using healthy monocytes with exosome-packaged HCV, cell-free HCV, or HCV ssRNA. Coculture of monocytes with exosome-packaged HCV, cell-free HCV, or HCV ssRNA induced differentiation into MΦs with high M2 surface marker expression and production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The HCV ssRNA-induced monocyte activation and differentiation into MΦs could be prevented by TLR7 or TLR8 knockdown. Furthermore, TLR7 or TLR8 stimulation, independent of HCV, caused monocyte differentiation and M2 MΦ polarization. In vivo, in chronic HCV-infected patients, we found increased expression of TLR7/8 in circulating monocytes that was associated with increased intracellular expression of procollagen. Furthermore, knockdown of TLR8 completely attenuated collagen expression in monocytes exposed to HCV, and knockdown of TLR7 partially attenuated this expression, suggesting roles for TLR7/8 in induction of fibrocytes in HCV infection. We identified TLR7/8 as mediators of monocyte differentiation and M2 MΦ polarization during HCV infection. Further, we demonstrated that HCV ssRNA and other TLR7/8 ligands promote MΦ polarization and generation of circulating fibrocytes.	PMC5322233

Adipose-derived circulating miRNAs regulate gene expression in other tissues.	Nature	2017	Adipose tissue is a major site of energy storage and has a role in the regulation of metabolism through the release of adipokines. Here we show that mice with an adipose-tissue-specific knockout of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme Dicer (ADicerKO), as well as humans with lipodystrophy, exhibit a substantial decrease in levels of circulating exosomal miRNAs. Transplantation of both white and brown adipose tissue-brown especially-into ADicerKO mice restores the level of numerous circulating miRNAs that are associated with an improvement in glucose tolerance and a reduction in hepatic Fgf21 mRNA and circulating FGF21. This gene regulation can be mimicked by the administration of normal, but not ADicerKO, serum exosomes. Expression of a human-specific miRNA in the brown adipose tissue of one mouse in vivo can also regulate its 3' UTR reporter in the liver of another mouse through serum exosomal transfer. Thus, adipose tissue constitutes an important source of circulating exosomal miRNAs, which can regulate gene expression in distant tissues and thereby serve as a previously undescribed form of adipokine.

J Cancer Res Clin Oncol	2017	BACKGROUND: ZFAS1 is a newly identified long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Exosomes mediate cellular communications in cancer by transmitting active molecules. The presence of ZFAS1 in the circulating exosomes and the roles of exosomal ZFAS1 in gastric cancer (GC) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential roles of exosomal ZFAS1 in GC. METHODS: The expression of ZFAS1 was examined in the tumor tissues, serum samples, serum exosomes of GC patients and cell lines using qRT-PCR. The correlation between ZFAS1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. The characteristics of exosomes were identified using transmission electron microscope (TEM), Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), and western blot. The biological roles of ZFAS1 in GC cell growth and mobility were investigated using cell counting, cell colony formation, and transwell migration assay. The potential mechanism of ZFAS1 was demonstrated using flow cytometry, western blot, and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: ZFAS1 expression was elevated in GC cells, tumor tissues, serum and serum exosomes of GC patients. The increased ZFAS1 expression was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis and TNM stage. ZFAS1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and migration of GC cells by suppressing cell cycle progression, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). On the contrary, ZFAS1 overexpression promoted the proliferation and migration of GC cells. Moreover, ZFAS1 was present in exosomes and could be transmitted by exosomes to enhance GC cell proliferation and migration. CONCLUSION: ZFAS1 could be delivered by exosomes to promote GC progression, which suggests that ZFAS1 may serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for GC.

Cell Death Dis	2017	Glioblastomas are incurable primary brain tumors that affect patients of all ages. The aggressiveness of this cancer has been attributed in part to the persistence of treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem-like cells. We have previously discovered the tumor-suppressor properties of the microRNA cluster miR-302-367, representing a potential treatment for glioblastoma. Here, we attempted to develop a cell-based therapy by taking advantage of the capability of glioma cells to secrete exosomes that enclose small RNA molecules. We engineered primary glioma cells to stably express the miR-302-367. Remarkably, these cells altered, in a paracrine-dependent manner, the expression of stemness markers, the proliferation and the tumorigenicity of neighboring glioblastoma cells. Further characterization of the secretome derived from miR-302-367 expressing cells showed that a large amount of miR-302-367 was enclosed in exosomes, which were internalized by the neighboring glioblastoma cells. This miR-302-367 cell-to-cell transfer resulted in the inhibition of its targets such as CXCR4/SDF1, SHH, cyclin D, cyclin A and E2F1. Orthotopic xenograft of miR-302-367-expressing cells together with glioblastoma stem-like cells efficiently altered the tumor development in mice brain.	PMC5386523

Glioma stem cells-derived exosomes promote the angiogenic ability of endothelial cells through miR-21/VEGF signal.	Oncotarget	2017	Glioma stem cells (GSCs) play an important role in glioblastoma prognosis. Exosomes (EXs) mediate cell communication by delivering microRNAs (miRs). Glioblastoma has a high level of miR-21 which could upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. We hypothesized GSC-EXs can promote the angiogenic ability of endothelial cells (ECs) through miR-21/VEGF signal. GSCs were isolated from U-251 cells with stem cell marker CD133. GSCs transfected without or with scramble or miR-21 mimics were used to produce GSC-EXscon, GSC-EXssc and GSC-EXsmiR-21. Human brain ECs were co-cultured with vehicle, GSC-EXscon, GSC-EXssc or GSC-EXsmiR-21 plus VEGF siRNAs (siRNAVEGF). After 24 hours, the angiogenic abilities of ECs were evaluated. The levels of miR-21, VEGF and p-Flk1/VEGFR2 were determined. Results showed: 1) Over 90% of purified GSCs expressed CD133; 2) The levels of miR-21 and VEGF in GSCs and GSC-EXs were up-regulated by miR-21 mimic transfection; 3) Compared to GSC-EXscon or GSC-EXssc, GSC-EXsmiR-21 were more effective in elevating the levels of miR-21 and VEGF, and the ratio of p-Flk1/VEGFR2 in ECs; 4) GSC-EXsmiR-21 were more effective in promoting the angiogenic ability of ECs than GSC-EXscon or GSC-EXssc, which were remarkably reduced by siRNAVEGF pretreatment. In conclusion, GSC-EXs can promote the angiogenic ability of ECs by stimulating miR-21/VEGF/VEGFR2 signal pathway.	PMC5482644

BMC Cancer	2017	BACKGROUND: Exosomes or extracellular vesicles have the potential as a diagnostic marker for various diseases including cancer. In order to identify novel exosomal markers for prostate cancer (PC), we performed proteomic analysis of exosomes isolated from PC cell lines and examined the usefulness of the marker in patients. METHODS: Exosomes isolated by differential centrifugation from the culture medium of androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cell line and its sublines of partially androgen-independent C4, androgen-independent C4-2 and bone metastatic C4-2B were subjected to iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis. Exosomes were also isolated by immunocapture and separated by size exclusion chromatography and density gradient centrifugation. Protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis. GGT activity was measured using a fluorescent probe, γ-glutamyl hydroxymethyl rhodamine green (gGlu-HMRG). Immunohistochemical analysis of tissues was performed using anti-GGT1 antibody. RESULTS: Among proteins upregulated in C4-2 and C4-2B cells than in LNCaP cells, we focused on gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1), a cell-surface enzyme that regulates the catabolism of extracellular glutathione. The levels of both GGT1 large and small subunits were elevated in exosomes isolated from C4-2 and C4-2B cells by differential centrifugation and by immunocapture with anti-CD9 or -prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibody. In cell lysates and exosomes, GGT1 expression correlated with GGT activity. Size exclusion chromatography of human serum demonstrated the presence of GGT activity and GGT1 subunits in fractions positive for CD9. Density gradient centrifugation revealed the co-presence of GGT1 subunits with CD9 in exosomes isolated by differential centrifugation from human serum. Since GGT activity correlated with GGT1 expression in serum exosomes isolated by differential centrifugation, we measured serum exosomal GGT activity in patients. Unexpectedly, we found that serum exosomal GGT activity was significantly higher in PC patients than in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients. In support of this finding, immunohistochemical analysis showed increased GGT1 expression in PC tissues compared with BPH tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that serum exosomal GGT activity could be a useful biomarker for PC.	PMC5420129

Exosomes from NSC-34 Cells Transfected with hSOD1-G93A Are Enriched in miR-124 and Drive Alterations in Microglia Phenotype.	Front Neurosci	2017	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor neurons (MNs). Evidences indicate that ALS is a non-cell autonomous disease in which glial cells participate in both disease onset and progression. Exosomal transfer of mutant copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) from cell-to-cell was suggested to contribute to disease dissemination. Data from our group and others showed that exosomes from activated cells contain inflammatory-related microRNAs (inflamma-miRNAs) that recapitulate the donor cell. While glia-derived exosomes and their effects in neurons have been addressed by several studies, only a few investigated the influence of motor neuron (MN)-derived exosomes in other cell function, the aim of the present study. We assessed a set of inflamma-miRs in NSC-34 MN-like cells transfected with mutant SOD1(G93A) and extended the study into their derived exosomes (mSOD1 exosomes). Then, the effects produced by mSOD1 exosomes in the activation and polarization of the recipient N9 microglial cells were investigated. Exosomes in coculture with N9 microglia and NSC-34 cells [either transfected with either wild-type (wt) human SOD1 or mutant SOD1(G93A)] showed to be transferred into N9 cells. Increased miR-124 expression was found in mSOD1 NSC-34 cells and in their derived exosomes. Incubation of mSOD1 exosomes with N9 cells determined a sustained 50% reduction in the cell phagocytic ability. It also caused a persistent NF-kB activation and an acute generation of NO, MMP-2, and MMP-9 activation, as well as upregulation of IL-1β, TNF-α, MHC-II, and iNOS gene expression, suggestive of induced M1 polarization. Marked elevation of IL-10, Arginase 1, TREM2, RAGE, and TLR4 mRNA levels, together with increased miR-124, miR-146a, and miR-155, at 24 h incubation, suggest the switch to mixed M1 and M2 subpopulations in the exosome-treated N9 microglial cells. Exosomes from mSOD1 NSC-34 MNs also enhanced the number of senescent-like positive N9 cells. Data suggest that miR-124 is translocated from the mSOD1 MNs to exosomes, which determine early and late phenotypic alterations in the recipient N9-microglial cells. In conclusion, modulation of the inflammatory-associated miR-124, in mSOD1 NSC-34 MNs, with potential benefits in the cargo of their exosomes may reveal a promising therapeutic strategy in halting microglia activation and associated effects in MN degeneration.

NPC-EXs Alleviate Endothelial Oxidative Stress and Dysfunction through the miR-210 Downstream Nox2 and VEGFR2 Pathways.	Oxid Med Cell Longev	2017	We have demonstrated that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) protect endothelial cells (ECs) from oxidative stress. Since exosomes (EXs) can convey the benefit of parent cells through their carried microRNAs (miRs) and miR-210 is ubiquitously expressed with versatile functions, we investigated the role of miR-210 in the effects of NPC-EXs on oxidative stress and dysfunction in ECs. NPCs were transfected with control and miR-210 scramble/inhibitor/mimic to generate NPC-EXscon, NPC-EXssc, NPC-EXsanti-miR-210, and NPC-EXsmiR-210. The effects of various NPC-EXs on angiotensin II- (Ang II-) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, apoptosis, and dysfunction, as well as dysregulation of Nox2, ephrin A3, VEGF, and p-VEGFR2/VEGFR2 in ECs were evaluated. Results showed (1) Ang II-induced ROS overproduction, increase in apoptosis, and decrease in tube formation ability, accompanied with Nox2 upregulation and reduction of p-VEGFR2/VEGFR2 in ECs. (2) Compared to NPC-EXscon or NPC-EXssc, NPC-EXsanti-miR-210 were less whereas NPC-EXsmiR-210 were more effective on attenuating these detrimental effects induced by Ang II in ECs. (3) These effects of NPC-EXsanti-miR-210 and NPC-EXsmiR-210 were associated with the changes of miR-210, ephrin A3, VEGF, and p-VEGFR2/VEGFR2 ratio in ECs. Altogether, the protective effects of NPC-EXs on Ang II-induced endothelial injury through miR-210 which controls Nox2/ROS and VEGF/VEGFR2 signals were studied.	PMC5467331

Sci Rep	2017	The goal of this study was to understand if exosomes derived from high-metastatic cells may influence the behavior of less aggressive cancer cells and the properties of the endothelium. We found that metastatic colon cancer cells are able to transfer their amoeboid phenotype to isogenic primary cancer cells through exosomes, and that this morphological transition is associated with the acquisition of a more aggressive behavior. Moreover, exosomes from the metastatic line (SW620Exos) exhibited higher ability to cause endothelial hyperpermeability than exosomes from the non metastatic line (SW480Exos). SWATH-based quantitative proteomic analysis highlighted that SW620Exos are significantly enriched in cytoskeletal-associated proteins including proteins activating the RhoA/ROCK pathway, known to induce amoeboid properties and destabilization of endothelial junctions. In particular, thrombin was identified as a key mediator of the effects induced by SW620Exos in target cells, in which we also found a significant increase of RhoA activity. Overall, our results demonstrate that in a heterogeneous context exosomes released by aggressive sub-clones can contribute to accelerate tumor progression by spreading malignant properties that affect both the tumor cell plasticity and the endothelial cell behavior.

Sci Rep	2017	Extracellular vesicles from eukaryotic cells and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released from gram-negative bacteria have been described as mediators of pathogen-host interaction and intercellular communication. Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) is a causative agent of severe pneumonia. The differential effect of bacterial and host cell vesicles in L. pneumophila infection is unknown so far. We infected THP-1-derived or primary human macrophages with L. pneumophila and isolated supernatant vesicles by differential centrifugation. We observed an increase of exosomes in the 100 k pellet by nanoparticle tracking analysis, electron microscopy, and protein markers. This fraction additionally contained Legionella LPS, indicating also the presence of OMVs. In contrast, vesicles in the 16 k pellet, representing microparticles, decreased during infection. The 100 k vesicle fraction activated uninfected primary human alveolar epithelial cells, A549 cells, and THP-1 cells. Epithelial cell activation was reduced by exosome depletion (anti-CD63, or GW4869), or blocking of IL-1β in the supernatant. In contrast, the response of THP-1 cells to vesicles was reduced by a TLR2-neutralizing antibody, UV-inactivation of bacteria, or - partially - RNase-treatment of vesicles. Taken together, we found that during L. pneumophila infection, neighbouring epithelial cells were predominantly activated by exosomes and cytokines, whereas myeloid cells were activated by bacterial OMVs.

Metastatic state of parent cells influences the uptake and functionality of prostate cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles.	J Extracell Vesicles	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including microvesicles and exosomes, mediate intercellular signalling which has a profound role in cancer progression and in the development of metastasis. Internalisation of EVs can prompt functional changes in the recipient cells, the nature of which depends on the molecular composition and the cargo of the EVs. We hypothesised that the metastatic stage of cancerous parent cells would determine the uptake efficacy and the subsequent functional effects of the respective cancer cell-derived EVs. To address this question, we compared the internalisation of EVs derived from two metastatic site-derived prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and LNCaP), human telomerase reverse transcriptase immortalised primary malignant prostate epithelial cells (RC92a/hTERT), and a benign epithelial prostate cell line (PNT2). EVs isolated from the metastatic site-derived PC-3 and LNCaP cells were more efficiently internalised by the PC-3 and PNT2 cells compared to the EVs from the primary malignant RC92a/hTERT cells or the benign PNT2 cells, as determined by high content microscopy, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. EV uptake was also influenced by the phase of the cell cycle, so that an increased EV-derived fluorescence signal was observed in the cells at the G2/M phase compared to the G0/G1 or S phases. Finally, differences were also observed in the functions of the recipient cells based on the EV source. Proliferation of PNT2 cells and to a lesser extent also PC-3 cells was enhanced particularly by the EVs from the metastatic-site-derived prostate cancer cells in comparison to the EVs from the benign cells or primary cancer cells, whereas migration of PC-3 cells was enhanced by all cancerous EVs.

Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Exosomes Ameliorate Experimental Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia and Restore Lung Function through Macrophage Immunomodulation.	Am J Respir Crit Care Med	2018	RATIONALE: Mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapies have shown promise in preclinical models of pathologies relevant to newborn medicine, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We have reported that the therapeutic capacity of MSCs is comprised in their secretome, and demonstrated that the therapeutic vectors are exosomes produced by MSCs (MSC-exos). OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy of MSC-exo treatment in a preclinical model of BPD and to investigate mechanisms underlying MSC-exo therapeutic action. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from media conditioned by human MSC cultures. Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia (HYRX; 75% O2), treated with exosomes on Postnatal Day (PN) 4 and returned to room air on PN7. Treated animals and appropriate controls were harvested on PN7, -14, or -42 for assessment of pulmonary parameters. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: HYRX-exposed mice presented with pronounced alveolar simplification, fibrosis, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was effectively ameliorated by MSC-exo treatment. Pulmonary function tests and assessment of pulmonary hypertension showed functional improvements after MSC-exo treatment. Lung mRNA sequencing demonstrated that MSC-exo treatment induced pleiotropic effects on gene expression associated with HYRX-induced inflammation and immune responses. MSC-exos modulate the macrophage phenotype fulcrum, suppressing the proinflammatory "M1" state and augmenting an antiinflammatory "M2-like" state, both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: MSC-exo treatment blunts HYRX-associated inflammation and alters the hyperoxic lung transcriptome. This results in alleviation of HYRX-induced BPD, improvement of lung function, decrease in fibrosis and pulmonary vascular remodeling, and amelioration of pulmonary hypertension. The MSC-exo mechanism of action is associated with modulation of lung macrophage phenotype.	PMC5765387

A novel non‑contact communication between human keratinocytes and T cells: Exosomes derived from keratinocytes support superantigen‑induced proliferation of resting T cells.	Mol Med Rep	2017	It is widely accepted that keratinocytes act as non‑professional antigen‑presenting cells and support superantigen‑induced proliferation of resting T cells; however, it remains unknown whether keratinocytes function in situ with T cells via a non‑contact mechanism. The current study used a transwell co‑culture system and demonstrated, for the first time to the best of the authors' knowledge, that HaCaT cells (the human keratinocyte cell line) did induce T cell proliferation via indirect contact. The data further indicated that exosomes, small membrane vesicles that transfer antigens to recipient cells, are also involved in the superantigen‑associated immunity of keratinocytes. The current study provided experimental evidence that HaCaT‑exosomes contained MHC I and II, and could interact with T cells. In addition, following interferon γ stimulation, Staphylococcal aureus enterotoxin B‑loaded HaCaT cells secreted exosomes to induce the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro. This novel biological function of exosomes reveals a new mechanism of how keratinocytes participate in bacterial superantigen‑induced immune responses.

Stem Cell Res Ther	2017	BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the major causes of mortality and disability for all ages worldwide. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-originated exosomes have provided therapeutic effects. However, as an indispensable component of MSCs, whether odontogenic stem cell-generated exosomes could benefit TBI is still unclear. Thus we aimed to explore the potential of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth-originated exosomes (SHED-Ex) for the management of TBI. METHODS: First, a transwell system was used to co-culture activated BV-2 microglia cells with SHED. The secretion levels of neuroinflammatory factors and nitrite were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Griess assay. Furthermore, purified SHED-Ex were co-cultured with activated BV-2. ELISA, Griess assay, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR were performed to test the levels of inflammatory factors as well as the microglia phenotype. Finally, SHED and SHED-Ex were locally injected into TBI rat models. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores were chosen to evaluate the motor functional recovery. Histopathology and immunofluorescence were performed to measure the lesion volume and neuroinflammation. RESULTS: As a result, SHED-Ex could reduce neuroinflammation by shifting microglia polarization. The administration of SHED-Ex improves rat motor functional recovery and reduces cortical lesion compared with the control group 2 weeks post-injury (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates for the first time that SHED-Ex contribute a therapeutic benefit to TBI in rats, at least in part by shifting microglia polarization to reduce neuroinflammation. The use of odontogenic stem cells, and indeed their exosomes, may be expanded for the treatment of TBI or other neurological disorders.	PMC5622448

Sci Rep	2017	Exosomes are vesicles released by many eukaryotic cells; their cargo includes proteins, mRNA and microRNA (miR) that can be transferred to recipient cells and regulate cellular processes in an autocrine or paracrine manner. While cells of the myoblast lineage secrete exosomes, it is not known whether skeletal muscle fibers (myofibers) release exosomes. In this study, we found that cultured myofibers release nanovesicles that have bilamellar membranes and an average size of 60-130 nm, contain typical exosomal proteins and miRNAs and are taken up by C2C12 cells. miR-133a was found to be the most abundant myomiR in these vesicles while miR-720 was most enriched in exosomes compared to parent myofibers. Treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with myofiber-derived exosomes downregulated the miR-133a targets proteins Smarcd1 and Runx2, confirming that these exosomes have biologically relevant effects on recipient cells. Denervation resulted in a marked increase in miR-206 and reduced expression of miRs 1, 133a, and 133b in myofiber-derived exosomes. These findings demonstrate that skeletal muscle fibers release exosomes which can exert biologically significant effects on recipient cells, and that pathological muscle conditions such as denervation induce alterations in exosomal miR profile which could influence responses to disease states through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms.

Med Sci (Basel)	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), nanoparticles originated from different cell types, seem to be implicated in several cellular activities. In the Central Nervous System (CNS), glia and neurons secrete EVs and recent studies have demonstrated that the intercellular communication mediated by EVs has versatile functional impact in the cerebral homeostasis. This essential role may be due to their proteins and RNAs cargo that possibly modify the phenotypes of the targeted cells. Despite the increasing importance of EVs, little is known about their fluctuations in physiological as well as in pathological conditions. Furthermore, only few studies have investigated the contents of contemporary EVs subgroups (microvesicles, MVs and exosomes, EXOs) with the purpose of discriminating between their features and functional roles. In order to possibly shed light on these issues, we performed a pilot study in which MVs and EXOs extracted from serum samples of a little cohort of subjects (patients with the first clinical evidence of CNS demyelination, also known as Clinically Isolated Syndrome and Healthy Controls) were submitted to deep small-RNA sequencing. Data were analysed by an in-home bioinformatics platform. In line with previous reports, distinct classes of non-coding RNAs have been detected in both the EVs subsets, offering interesting suggestions on their origins and functions. We also verified the feasibility of this extensive molecular approach, thus supporting its valuable use for the analysis of circulating biomarkers (e.g., microRNAs) in order to investigate and monitor specific diseases.

Diet-resistant obesity is characterized by a distinct plasma proteomic signature and impaired muscle fiber metabolism.	Int J Obes (Lond)	2018	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Inter-individual variability in weight loss during obesity treatment is complex and poorly understood. Here we use whole body and tissue approaches to investigate fuel oxidation characteristics in skeletal muscle fibers, cells and distinct circulating protein biomarkers before and after a high fat meal (HFM) challenge in those who lost the most (obese diet-sensitive; ODS) vs the least (obese diet-resistant; ODR) amount of weight in a highly controlled weight management program. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In 20 weight stable-matched ODS and ODR women who previously completed a standardized clinical weight loss program, we analyzed whole-body energetics and metabolic parameters in vastus lateralis biopsies and plasma samples that were obtained in the fasting state and 6 h after a defined HFM, equivalent to 35% of total daily energy requirements. RESULTS: At baseline (fasting) and post-HFM, muscle fatty acid oxidation and maximal oxidative phosphorylation were significantly greater in ODS vs ODR, as was reactive oxygen species emission. Plasma proteomics of 1130 proteins pre and 1, 2, 5 and 6 h after the HFM demonstrated distinct group and interaction differences. Group differences identified S-formyl glutathione hydratase, heat shock 70 kDA protein 1A/B (HSP72), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF5) to be higher in ODS vs ODR. Group-time differences included aryl hydrocarbon interacting protein (AIP), peptidylpropyl isomerase D (PPID) and tyrosine protein-kinase Fgr, which increased in ODR vs ODS over time. HSP72 levels correlated with muscle oxidation and citrate synthase activity. These proteins circulate in exosomes; exosomes isolated from ODS plasma increased resting, leak and maximal respiration rates in C2C12 myotubes by 58%, 21% and 51%, respectively, vs those isolated from ODR plasma. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate distinct muscle metabolism and plasma proteomics in fasting and post-HFM states corresponding in diet-sensitive vs diet-resistant obese women.	PMC5880582

In order to deeply understand the mechanism underlying nanovesicle effects, we performed a proteomic profile of treated colorectal cancer cells. Among the proteins differentially expressed after nanovesicle treatment, we found a significant downregulation of the Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase 1 (ACACA) and we demonstrated that silencing ACACA in cancer cells leads to a reduction of cell growth. Our study proved that the anti-tumor effects of Citrus-limon nanovesicles is partly mediated by lipid metabolism inhibition, in particular via ACACA downregulation. SIGNIFICANCE: This study represents the attempt to achieve, by a proteomic approach, a better understanding of the role of lemon nanovesicles in affecting colorectal cancer cell growth.

J Mol Cell Cardiol	2018	AIMS: Calcium phosphate (CaP) particle deposits are found in several inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis and osteoarthritis. CaP, and other forms of crystals and particles, can promote inflammasome formation in macrophages leading to caspase-1 activation and secretion of mature interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Given the close association of small CaP particles with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in atherosclerotic fibrous caps, we aimed to determine if CaP particles affected pro-inflammatory signalling in human VSMCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using ELISA to measure IL-1β release from VSMCs, we demonstrated that CaP particles stimulated IL-1β release from proliferating and senescent human VSMCs, but with substantially greater IL-1β release from senescent cells; this required caspase-1 activity but not LPS-priming of cells. Potential inflammasome agonists including ATP, nigericin and monosodium urate crystals did not stimulate IL-1β release from VSMCs. Western blot analysis demonstrated that CaP particles induced rapid activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) (increased phospho-Y525/526). The SYK inhibitor R406 reduced IL-1β release and caspase-1 activation in CaP particle-treated VSMCs, indicating that SYK activation occurs upstream of and is required for caspase-1 activation. In addition, IL-1β and caspase-1 colocalised in intracellular endosome-like vesicles and we detected IL-1β in exosomes isolated from VSMC media. Furthermore, CaP particle treatment stimulated exosome secretion by VSMCs in a SYK-dependent manner, while the exosome-release inhibitor spiroepoxide reduced IL-1β release. CONCLUSIONS: CaP particles stimulate SYK and caspase-1 activation in VSMCs, leading to the release of IL-1β, at least in part via exosomes. These novel findings in human VSMCs highlight the pro-inflammatory and pro-calcific potential of microcalcification.	PMC5823844

Exosomes derived from cardiac telocytes exert positive effects on endothelial cells.	Am J Transl Res	2017	Telocytes are novel cells that have been documented in the interstitium of multiple organs; however, their role in the heart remains unclear. This study aimed to identify cardiac telocytes by their morphological and molecular features and investigate whether their exosomes affect cardiac endothelial cells. To this end, rat cardiac telocytes were cultured and stained with methylene blue, Janus Green B, and MitoTracker green, or with antibodies for established cell surface markers, and examined by microscopy. In addition, telocyte organelles and exosome release were examined by transmission electron microscopy. To investigate exosome functions, we isolated exosomes from telocytes and co-cultured them with endothelial cells in vitro, as well as transfusing them into a rat model of myocardial infarction. We confirmed that cultured telocytes exhibit normal characteristics, including long, thin prolongations with a moniliform appearance, as well as positive expression of c-Kit, CD34, and vimentin. Furthermore, we observed mitochondria throughout the cell body and telopodes, and found that telocytes actively secrete exosomes. Interestingly, endothelial cells cultured with telocyte supernatants or exosomes exhibited increased proliferation, migration, and formation of capillary-like structures, and these effects were attenuated when exosomes were depleted from telocyte supernatants. Finally, treating myocardial infarction-induced rats with telocyte exosomes resulted in decreased cardiac fibrosis, improved cardiac function, and increased angiogenesis. Taken together, our results provide novel insight into cardiac telocytes, suggesting that they communicate with neighboring endothelial cells via exosome secretion and that these exosomes exert potentially beneficially effects.

Oviductal extracellular vesicles (oviductosomes, OVS) are conserved in humans: murine OVS play a pivotal role in sperm capacitation and fertility.	Mol Hum Reprod	2018	STUDY QUESTIONS: Are extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the murine oviduct (oviductosomes, OVS) conserved in humans and do they play a role in the fertility of Pmca4-/- females? SUMMARY ANSWER: OVS and their fertility-modulating proteins are conserved in humans, arise via the apocrine pathway, and mediate a compensatory upregulation of PMCA1 (plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 1) in Pmca4-/- female mice during proestrus/estrus, to account for their fertility. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Recently murine OVS were identified and shown during proestrus/estrus to express elevated levels of PMCA4 which they can deliver to sperm. PMCA4 is the major Ca2+ efflux pump in murine sperm and Pmca4 deletion leads to loss of sperm motility and male infertility as there is no compensatory upregulation of the remaining Ca2+ pump, PMCA1. Of the four family members of PMCAs (PMCA1-4), PMCA1 and PMCA4 are ubiquitous, and to date there have been no reports of one isoform being upregulated to compensate for another in any organ/tissue. Since Pmca4-/- females are fertile, despite the abundant expression of PMCA4 in wild-type (WT) OVS, we propose that OVS serve a role of packaging and delivering to sperm elevated levels of PMCA1 in Pmca4-/- during proestrus/estrus to compensate for PMCA4's absence. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Fallopian tubes from pre-menopausal women undergoing hysterectomy were used to study EVs in the luminal fluid. Oviducts from sexually mature WT mice were sectioned after perfusion fixation to detect EVs in situ. Oviducts were recovered from WT and Pmca4-/- after hormonally induced estrus and sectioned for PMCA1 immunofluorescence (IF) (detected with confocal microscopy) and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Reproductive tissues, luminal fluids and EVs were recovered after induced estrus and after natural cycling for western blot analysis of PMCA1 and qRT-PCR of Pmca1 to compare expression levels in WT and Pmca4-/-. OVS, uterosomes, and epididymal luminal fluid were included in the comparisons. WT and Pmca4-/- OVS were analyzed for the presence of known PMCA4 partners in sperm and their ability to interact with PMCA1, via co-immunoprecipitation. In vitro uptake of PMCA1 from OVS was analyzed in capacitated and uncapacitated sperm via quantitative western blot analysis, IF localization and flow cytometry. Caudal sperm were also assayed for uptake of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins which were shown to be present in OVS. Finally, PMCA1 and PMCA4 in OVS and that delivered to sperm were assayed for enzymatic activity. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Human fallopian tubes were flushed to recover luminal fluid which was processed for OVS via ultracentrifugation. Human OVS were negatively stained for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and subjected to immunogold labeling, to detect PMCA4. Western analysis was used to detect HSC70 (an EV biomarker), PMCA1 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) which is a fertility-modulating protein delivered to human sperm by prostasomes. Oviducts of sexually mature female mice were sectioned after perfusion fixation for TEM tomography to obtain 3D information and to distinguish cross-sections of EVs from those of microvilli and cilia. Murine tissues, luminal fluids and EVs were assayed for PMCA1 (IF and western blot) or qRT-PCR. PMCA1 levels from western blots were quantified, using band densities and compared in WT and Pmca4-/- after induced estrus and in proestrus/estrus and metestrus/diestrus in cycling females. In vitro uptake of PMCA1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was quantified with flow cytometry and/or quantitative western blot. Ca2+-ATPase activity in OVS and sperm before and after PMCA1 and PMCA4 uptake was assayed, via the enzymatic hydrolysis rate of ATP. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: TEM revealed that human oviducts contain EVs (exosomal and microvesicular). These EVs contain PMCA4 (immunolabeling), eNOS and PMCA1 (western blot) in their cargo. TEM tomography showed the murine oviduct with EV-containing blebs which typify the apocrine pathway for EV biogenesis. Western blots revealed that during proestrus/estrus PMCA1 was significantly elevated in the oviductal luminal fluid (OLF) (P = 0.02) and in OVS (P = 0.03) of Pmca4-/-, compared to WT. Further, while PMCA1 levels did not fluctuate in OLF during the cycle in WT, they were significantly (P = 0.02) higher in proestrus/estrus than at metestrus/diestrus in Pmca4-/-. The elevated levels of PMCA1 in proestrus/estrus, which mimics PMCA4 in WT, is OLF/OVS-specific, and is not seen in oviductal tissues, uterosomes or epididymal luminal fluid of Pmca4-/-. However, qRT-PCR revealed significantly elevated levels of Pmca1 transcript in Pmca4-/- oviductal tissues, compared to WT. PMCA1 could be transferred from OVS to sperm and the levels were significantly higher for capacitated vs uncapacitated sperm, as assessed by flow cytometry (P = 0.001) after 3 h co-incubation, quantitative western blot (P < 0.05) and the frequency of immuno-labeled sperm (P < 0.001) after 30 min co-incubation. Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were discovered in murine OVS and could be delivered to sperm after their co-incubation with OVS, as detected by western, immunofluorescence localization, and flow cytometry. PMCA1 and PMCA4 in OVS were shown to be enzymatically active and this activity increased in sperm after OVS interaction. LARGE SCALE DATA: None. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although oviductal tissues of WT and Pmca4-/- showed no significant difference in PMCA1 levels, Pmca4-/- levels of OVS/OLF during proestrus/estrus were significantly higher than in WT. We have attributed this enrichment or upregulation of PMCA1 in Pmca4-/- partly to selective packaging in OVS to compensate for the lack of PMCA4. However, in the absence of a difference between WT and Pmca4-/- in the PMCA1 levels in oviductal tissues as a whole, we cannot rule out significantly higher PMCA1 expression in the oviductal epithelium that gives rise to the OVS as significantly higher Pmca1 transcripts were detected in Pmca4-/-. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Since OVS and fertility-modulating cargo components are conserved in humans, it suggests that murine OVS role in regulating the expression of proteins required for capacitation and fertility is also conserved. Secondly, OVS may explain some of the differences in in vivo and in vitro fertilization for mouse mutants, as seen in mice lacking the gene for FER which is the enzyme required for sperm protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Our observation that murine OVS carry and can modulate sperm protein tyrosine phosphorylation by delivering them to sperm provides an explanation for the in vivo fertility of Fer mutants, not seen in vitro. Finally, our findings have implications for infertility treatment and exosome therapeutics.

Vaccine	2018	DNA vaccines composed of heterologous human HER2 and rat neu sequences induce stronger antibody response and protective antitumor immunity than either HER2 or neu DNA vaccines in transgenic mice. We previously developed HER2-specific exosome-targeted T-cell vaccine HER2-TEXO capable of stimulating HER2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, but only leading to partial protective immunity in double-transgenic HLA-A2/HER2 mice with self-immune tolerance to HER2. Here, we constructed an adenoviral vector AdVHuRt expressing HuRt fusion protein composed of NH2-HER21-407 (Hu) and COOH-neu408-690 (Rt) fragments, and developed a heterologous human/rat HER2-specific exosome-targeted T-cell vaccine HuRt-TEXO using polyclonal CD4+ T-cells uptaking exosomes released by AdVHuRt-transfected dendritic cells. We found that the HuRt-TEXO vaccine stimulates enhanced CD4+ T-cell responses leading to increased induction of HER2-specific antibody (∼70 µg/ml) compared to that (∼40 µg/ml) triggered by the homologous HER2-TEXO vaccine. By using PE-H-2Kd/HER223-71 tetramer, we determined that HuRt-TEXO stimulates stronger HER2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses eradicating 90% of HER2-specific target cells, while HER2-TEXO-induced CD8+ T-cell responses only eliminating 53% targets. Furthermore, HuRt-TEXO, but not HER2-TEXO vaccination, is capable of suppressing early stage-established HER2-expressing 4T1HER2 breast cancer in its lung metastasis or subcutaneous form in BALB/c mice, and of completely protecting transgenic HLA-A2/HER2 mice from growth of HLA-A2/HER2-expressing BL6-10A2/HER2 melanoma. HuRt-TEXO-stimulated HER2-specific CD8+ T-cells not only are cytolytic to trastuzumab-resistant HLA-A2/HER2-expressing BT474/A2 breast tumor cells in vitro but also eradicates pre-established BT474/A2 tumors in athymic nude mice. Therefore, our novel heterologous human/rat HER2-specific T-cell vaccine HuRt-TEXO, circumventing HER2 tolerance, may provide a new therapeutic alternative for patients with trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ breast tumor.

Exosome-Mediated Ultra-Effective Direct Conversion of Human Fibroblasts into Neural Progenitor-like Cells.	ACS Nano	2018	Exosomes, naturally secreted nanoparticles, have been introduced as vehicles for horizontal transfer of genetic material. We induced autologous exosomes containing a cocktail of reprogramming factors ("reprosomes") to convert fibroblasts into neural progenitor cells (NPCs). The fibroblasts were treated with ultrasound and subsequently cultured in neural stem cell medium for 1 day to induce the release of reprosomes composed of reprogramming factors associated with chromatin remodeling and neural lineage-specific factors. After being treated with reprosomes, fibroblasts were converted into NPCs (rNPCs) with great efficiency via activation of chromatin remodeling, so quickly that only 5 days were required for the formation of 1500 spheroids showing an NPC-like phenotype. The rNPCs maintained self-renewal and proliferative properties for several weeks and successfully differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in vitro and in vivo. Reprosome-mediated cellular reprogramming is simple, safe, and efficient to produce autologous stem cells for clinical application.

Proteome profiling of extracellular vesicles captured with the affinity peptide Vn96: comparison of Laemmli and TRIzol© protein-extraction methods.	J Extracell Vesicles	2018	Sample amount is often a limiting factor for multi-parametric analyses that encompass at least three areas of '-omics' research: genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. Limited sample amounts are also an important consideration when these multi-parametric analyses are performed on extracellular vesicles (EVs), as the amount of EVs (and EV cargo) that can be isolated is often very low. It is well understood that a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate (i.e. TRIzol©) can simultaneously isolate DNA, RNA and proteins from biological samples; however, it is most commonly used for the extraction of RNA. Validation of this reagent for the isolation of multiple classes of biological molecules from EVs would provide a widely applicable method for performing multi-parametric analyses of EV material. In this report, we describe a comparison of proteins identified from EVs processed with either TRIzol© or the conventional Laemmli buffer protein-extraction reagents. EVs were isolated from 3 mL of cell-culture supernatant derived from MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells using the Vn96 EV capture technology. For the TRIzol© extraction protocol, proteins were precipitated with acetone from the organic phase and then re-solubilized in a mixture of 8M urea, 0.2% SDS and 1 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, followed by dilution in 5× loading buffer prior to fractionation with 1D SDS-PAGE. NanoLC-MS/MS of the trypsin-digested proteins was used to generate proteomic profiles from EV protein samples extracted with each method. Of the identified proteins, 57.7%, 69.2% and 57.0% were common to both extraction methods for EVs from MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, respectively. Our results suggest that TRIzol© extraction of proteins from EVs has significant equivalence to the traditional Laemmli method. The advantage of using TRIzol	PMC5827780

Comparison of the extraction and determination of serum exosome and miRNA in serum and the detection of miR-27a-3p in serum exosome of ALS patients.	Intractable Rare Dis Res	2018	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a muscle-bone degenerative disease, which lacks a specific index for diagnosis. In our previous studies, we found that exosomes mediated the interaction mechanism between muscle and bone at the cellular level, and myoblast exosomes can transfer miR-27a-3p to promote osteoblast mineralization. Therefore, we suppose that the expression of miR-27a-3p in the serum exosomes of ALS patients also changes. In this study, we used healthy human serum as a sample to find out the conditions and methods for extraction and detection. Then through comparison of the expression of miR-27a-3p in the serum exosomes of 10 ALS patients and healthy subjects, we found that in the ALS patients miR-27a-3p was down-regulated, and may be involved in the development of ALS, and therefore has potential as a reference for the diagnosis of ALS in the clinic.

Lasers Med Sci	2018	The distinct role of low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) on endothelial exosome biogenesis remains unclear. We hypothesize that laser irradiation of high dose in human endothelial cells (ECs) contributes to the modulation of exosome biogenesis via Wnt signaling pathway. When human ECs were treated with LLLI at a power density of 80 J/cm2, the survival rate reduced. The potential of irradiated cells to release exosomes was increased significantly by expressing genes CD63, Alix, Rab27a, and b. This occurrence coincided with an enhanced acetylcholine esterase activity, pseudopodia formation, and reduced zeta potential value 24 h post-irradiation. Western blotting showed the induction of LC3 and reduced level of P62, confirming autophagy response. Flow cytometry and electron microscopy analyses revealed the health status of the mitochondrial function indicated by normal ΔΨ activity without any changes in the transcription level of PINK1 and Optineurin. When cells exposed to high power laser irradiation, p-Akt/Akt ratio and in vitro tubulogenesis capacity were blunted. PCR array and bioinformatics analyses showed the induction of transcription factors promoting Wnt signaling pathways and GTPase activity. Thus, LLLI at high power intensity increased exosome biogenesis by the induction of autophagy and Wnt signaling. LLLI at high power intensity increases exosome biogenesis by engaging the transcription factors related to Wnt signaling and autophagy stimulate.

Electronic address: .	mmonzo@ub.edu		Proteomic Analysis of Liquid Biopsy from Tumor-Draining Vein Indicates that High Expression of Exosomal ECM1 Is Associated with Relapse in Stage I-III Colon Cancer.	Transl Oncol	2018	BACKGROUND: The analysis of exosomes in blood obtained from the tumor-draining mesenteric vein (MV) can identify tumor biomarkers before they reach target organs and form the premetastatic niche where circulating tumor cells can anchor. Our group has recently shown that microRNAs in plasma from the MV-but not the peripheral vein (PV)-have been related to liver metastases in colon cancer (CC) patients. Here we examine the exosomal protein cargo in plasma from the MV and paired PV in 31 CC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included patients who were initially diagnosed with stage I-III CC and 10 healthy controls. Exosomes from the MV and PV of all patients and controls were isolated by ultracentrifugation and confirmed by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. High-throughput proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry was used to identify expression levels of exosomal proteins. Findings were confirmed by Western blot. RESULTS: Exosomal ECM1 protein was more highly expressed in patients than in controls and was 13.55 times higher in MV from relapsed than relapse-free patients. High exosomal ECM1 expression was associated with liver metastases. Patients with high exosomal ECM1 expression in MV-but not PV-plasma had shorter time to relapse than those with low ECM1 expression (P = .04). CONCLUSION: High levels of exosomal ECM1 protein can identify CC patients with a higher risk of relapse. The analysis of exosomes isolated from the tumor-draining MV is a promising method for the identification of biomarkers before they reach the target organ.

Curr Stem Cell Res Ther	2018	Stem/progenitor cells for cell therapy and regenerative medicine should ideally be available in large numbers, after having been isolated using minimally invasive or non-invasive methodologies. Also, they should exhibit wide differentiation potential into multiple lineages, as well as capability to be used successfully in autologous or allogeneic transplantation, and all this in accordance with the applicable guidelines of good manufacturing practice. Thus, the identification and characterization of alternative sources of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is of great importance. The human uterus emerges as an interesting source of MSCs. Both endometrial MSCs (eMSCs) and human uterine cervical stem cells (hUCESCs) easily to be obtained with minimal morbidity. Both eMSCs and hUCESCs show a high proliferation rate, which allows to harvest high amounts of them, both for research studies and potential therapeutic uses. It has been demonstrated that eMSCs have wide capability of differentiation into many cellular lineages, as well as potential therapeutic effects in several pathological processes. On the other hand, hUCESCs'secretome (conditioned medium) shows potent anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-bacterial and regenerative properties.

Extracellular vesicles induce protective immunity against Trichuris muris.	Parasite Immunol	2018	Gastrointestinal nematodes, such as Trichuris trichiura (human whipworm), are a major source of morbidity in humans and their livestock. There is a paucity of commercially available vaccines against these parasites, and vaccine development for T. trichiura has been impeded by a lack of known host protective antigens. Experimental vaccinations with T. muris (murine whipworm) soluble Excretory/Secretory (ES) material have demonstrated that it is possible to induce protective immunity in mice, however the potential for extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a source of antigenic material has remained relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that EVs isolated from T. muris ES can induce protective immunity in mice when administered as a vaccine without adjuvant, and show that the protective properties of these EVs are dependent on intact vesicles. We also identified several proteins within EV preparations that are targeted by the host antibodies following vaccination and subsequent infection with T. muris. Many of these proteins, including VWD and Vitellogenin N and DUF1943-domain containing protein, Vacuolar protein sorting associated protein 52 and TSP-1 domain containing protein, were detected in both soluble ES and EV samples and have homologues in other parasites of medical and veterinary importance, and as such are possible protective antigens.

Tumor-derived exosomes are a source of shared tumor rejection antigens for CTL cross-priming.	Nat Med	2001	The initiation of T-cell-mediated antitumor immune responses requires the uptake and processing of tumor antigens by dendritic cells and their presentation on MHC-I molecules. Here we show in a human in vitro model system that exosomes, a population of small membrane vesicles secreted by living tumor cells, contain and transfer tumor antigens to dendritic cells. After mouse tumor exosome uptake, dendritic cells induce potent CD8+ T-cell-dependent antitumor effects on syngeneic and allogeneic established mouse tumors. Therefore, exosomes represent a novel source of tumor-rejection antigens for T-cell cross priming, relevant for immunointerventions.

Microvesicles derived from activated platelets induce metastasis and angiogenesis in lung cancer.	Int J Cancer	2005	The role of platelets in tumor progression and metastasis has been recognized but the mechanism of their action remains unclear. Five human lung cancer cell lines (A549, CRL 2066, CRL 2062, HTB 183, HTB 177) and a murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LCC) cell line (for an in vivo model of metastasis) were used to investigate how platelet-derived microvesicles (PMV), which are circular fragments shed from the surface membranes of activated platelets, and exosomes released from platelet alpha-granules, could contribute to metastatic spread. We found that PMV transferred the platelet-derived integrin CD41 to most of the lung cancer cell lines tested and stimulated the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p42/44 and serine/threonine kinase as well as the expression of membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). PMV chemoattracted 4 of the 5 cell lines, with the highly metastatic A549 cells exhibiting the strongest response. In A549 cells, PMV were shown to stimulate proliferation, upregulate cyclin D2 expression and increase trans-Matrigel chemoinvasion. Furthermore, in these cells, PMV stimulated mRNA expression for angiogenic factors such as MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-8 and hepatocyte growth factor, as well as adhesion to fibrinogen and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Intravenous injection of murine PMV-covered LLC cells into syngeneic mice resulted in significantly more metastatic foci in their lungs and LLC cells in bone marrow than in control animals injected with LCC cells not covered with PMV. Based on these findings, we suggest that PMV play an important role in tumor progression/metastasis and angiogenesis in lung cancer.

Surveillance of nuclear-restricted pre-ribosomes within a subnucleolar region of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	EMBO J	2006	We previously hypothesized that HEAT-repeat (Huntington, elongation A subunit, TOR) ribosome synthesis factors function in ribosome export. We report that the HEAT-repeat protein Sda1p is a component of late 60S pre-ribosomes and is required for nuclear export of both ribosomal subunits. In strains carrying the ts-lethal sda1-2 mutation, pre-60S particles were rapidly degraded following transfer to 37 degrees C. Polyadenylated forms of the 27S pre-rRNA and the 25S rRNA were detected, suggesting the involvement of the Trf4p/Air/Mtr4p polyadenylation complex (TRAMP). The absence of Trf4p suppressed polyadenylation and stabilized the pre-rRNA and rRNA. The absence of the nuclear exosome component Rrp6p also conferred RNA stabilization, with some hyperadenylation. We conclude that the nuclear-restricted pre-ribosomes are polyadenylated by TRAMP and degraded by the exosome. In sda1-2 strains at 37 degrees C, pre-40S and pre-60S ribosomes initially accumulated in the nucleoplasm, but then strongly concentrated in a subnucleolar focus, together with exosome and TRAMP components. Localization of pre-ribosomes to this focus was lost in sda1-2 strains lacking Trf4p or Rrp6p. We designate this nucleolar focus the No-body and propose that it represents a site of pre-ribosome surveillance.	PMC1440318

T cell exosomes induce cholesterol accumulation in human monocytes via phosphatidylserine receptor.	J Cell Physiol	2007	Activated T lymphocytes release vesicles, termed exosomes, enriched in cholesterol and exposing phosphatidylserine (PS) at their outer membrane leaflet. Although CD4(+) activated T lymphocytes infiltrate an atherosclerotic plaque, the effects of T cell exosomes on the atheroma-associated cells are not known. We report here that exosomes isolated from the supernatants of activated human CD4(+) T cells enhance cholesterol accumulation in cultured human monocytes and THP-1 cells. Lipid droplets found in the cytosol of exosome-treated monocytes contained both cholesterol ester and free cholesterol. Anti-phosphatidylserine receptor antibodies recognized surface protein on the monocyte plasma membrane and prevented exosome-induced cholesterol accumulation, indicating that exosome internalization is mediated via endogenous phosphatidylserine receptor. The production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha enhanced in parallel with monocyte cholesterol accumulation. Our data strongly indicate that exosomes released by activated T cells may represent a powerful, previously unknown, atherogenic factor.

Crit Care	2007	INTRODUCTION: Mechanisms underlying inotropic failure in septic shock are incompletely understood. We previously identified the presence of exosomes in the plasma of septic shock patients. These exosomes are released mainly by platelets, produce superoxide, and induce apoptosis in vascular cells by a redox-dependent pathway. We hypothesized that circulating platelet-derived exosomes could contribute to inotropic dysfunction of sepsis. METHODS: We collected blood samples from 55 patients with septic shock and 12 healthy volunteers for exosome separation. Exosomes from septic patients and healthy individuals were investigated concerning their myocardial depressant effect in isolated heart and papillary muscle preparations. RESULTS: Exosomes from the plasma of septic patients significantly decreased positive and negative derivatives of left ventricular pressure in isolated rabbit hearts or developed tension and its first positive derivative in papillary muscles. Exosomes from healthy individuals decreased these variables non-significantly. In hearts from rabbits previously exposed to endotoxin, septic exosomes decreased positive and negative derivatives of ventricular pressure. This negative inotropic effect was fully reversible upon withdrawal of exosomes. Nitric oxide (NO) production from exosomes derived from septic shock patients was demonstrated by fluorescence. Also, there was an increase in myocardial nitrate content after exposure to septic exosomes. CONCLUSION: Circulating platelet-derived exosomes from septic patients induced myocardial dysfunction in isolated heart and papillary muscle preparations, a phenomenon enhanced by previous in vivo exposure to lipopolysaccharide. The generation of NO by septic exosomes and the increased myocardial nitrate content after incubation with exosomes from septic patients suggest an NO-dependent mechanism that may contribute to myocardial dysfunction of sepsis.

Nedd4 family-interacting protein 1 (Ndfip1) is required for the exosomal secretion of Nedd4 family proteins.	J Biol Chem	2008	The ability to remove unwanted proteins is an important cellular feature. Classically, this involves the enzymatic addition of ubiquitin moieties followed by degradation in the proteasome. Nedd4 proteins are ubiquitin ligases important not only for protein degradation, but also for protein trafficking. Nedd4 proteins can bind to target proteins either by themselves or through adaptor protein Ndfip1 (Nedd4 family-interacting protein 1). An alternative mechanism for protein removal and trafficking is provided by exosomes, which are small vesicles (50-90-nm diameter) originating from late endosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Exosomes provide a rapid means of shedding obsolete proteins and also for cell to cell communication. In the present work, we show that Ndfip1 is detectable in exosomes secreted from transfected cells and also from primary neurons. Compared with control, Ndfip1 increases exosome secretion from transfected cells. Furthermore, while Nedd4, Nedd4-2, and Itch are normally absent from exosomes, expression of Ndfip1 results in recruitment of all three Nedd4 proteins into exosomes. Together, these results suggest that Ndfip1 is important for protein trafficking via exosomes, and provides a mechanism for cargoing passenger proteins such as Nedd4 family proteins. Given the positive roles of Ndfip1/Nedd4 in improving neuronal survival during brain injury, it is possible that exosome secretion provides a novel route for rapid sequestration and removal of proteins during stress.

COP9-associated CSN5 regulates exosomal protein deubiquitination and sorting.	Am J Pathol	2009	Ubiquitinated endosomal proteins that are deposited into the lumens of multivesicular bodies are either sorted for lysosomal-mediated degradation or secreted as exosomes into the extracellular milieu. The mechanisms that underlie the sorting of cellular cargo proteins are currently unknown. In this study, we show that the COP9 signalosome (CSN)-associated protein CSN5 quantitatively regulated proteins that were sorted into exosomes. Western blot analysis of exosomal proteins indicated that small interfering (si)RNA knockdown of CSN5 results in increased levels of both ubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated exosomal proteins, including heat shock protein 70, in comparison with exosomes isolated from the supernatants of 293 cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. Furthermore, 293 cells transfected with JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme domain-deleted CSN5 produced exosomes with higher levels of ubiquitinated heat shock protein 70, which did not affect non-ubiquitinated heat shock protein 70 levels. The loss of COP9-associated deubiquitin activity of CSN5 also led to the enhancement of HIV Gag that was sorted into exosomes as well as the promotion of HIV-1 release, suggesting that COP9-associated CSN5 regulates the sorting of a number of exosomal proteins in both a CSN5 JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme domain-dependent and -independent manner. We propose that COP9-associated CSN5 regulates exosomal protein sorting in both a deubiquitinating activity-dependent and -independent manner, which is contrary to the current idea of ubiquitin-dependent sorting of proteins to exosomes.

BMC Bioinformatics	2009	BACKGROUND: The assembly of reliable and complete protein-protein interaction (PPI) maps remains one of the significant challenges in systems biology. Computational methods which integrate and prioritize interaction data can greatly aid in approaching this goal. RESULTS: We developed a Bayesian inference framework which uses phylogenetic relationships to guide the integration of PPI evidence across multiple datasets and species, providing more accurate predictions. We apply our framework to reconcile seven eukaryotic interactomes: H. sapiens, M. musculus, R. norvegicus, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana. Comprehensive GO-based quality assessment indicates a 5% to 44% score increase in predicted interactomes compared to the input data. Further support is provided by gold-standard MIPS, CYC2008 and HPRD datasets. We demonstrate the ability to recover known PPIs in well-characterized yeast and human complexes (26S proteasome, endosome and exosome) and suggest possible new partners interacting with the putative SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in A. thaliana. CONCLUSION: Our phylogeny-guided approach compares favorably to two standard methods for mapping PPIs across species. Detailed analysis of predictions in selected functional modules uncovers specific PPI profiles among homologous proteins, establishing interaction-based partitioning of protein families. Provided evidence also suggests that interactions within core complex subunits are in general more conserved and easier to transfer accurately to other organisms, than interactions between these subunits.

Trophoblast-derived exosomes mediate monocyte recruitment and differentiation.	Am J Reprod Immunol	2011	INTRODUCTION: trophoblast cells have been demonstrated to regulate monocyte migration and differentiation, leading to pro-inflammatory profiles. Because trophoblast cells release exosomes with immunoregulatory properties, trophoblast-derived exosomes are proposed to 'educate' monocytes, creating a pro-inflammatory environment. METHOD OF STUDY: exosomes were isolated from conditioned media of Swan71 cells by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation. Exosome-induced migration was assessed using a two-chamber system. Cytokine profiles were defined using cytokine arrays, and mRNA levels of affected cytokines were examined by qRT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: within 20 min, 8-10% of monocytes took up labeled exosomes isolated from Swan71 cells. Trophoblast-derived exosomes increased monocyte migration in a dose-dependent manner and produced significant increases in production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, Serpin-E1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/monocyte colony-stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor-α. CONCLUSION: this study presents the initial demonstration that trophoblast-derived exosomes are capable of recruiting and 'educating' monocytes to produce pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine profiles in a cell-contact-independent manner.

Commun Integr Biol	2010	The physiological role of microRNAs (miRNAs) is widely appreciated as a fine-tuner to post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of multiple genes in the cells of origin. Here, we highlight two significant characteristics of miRNAs: (1) they are secreted from the producing cells and (2) they can deliver the gene silencing signals between living cells in vitro and in vivo. The circulation of miRNAs in human body fluids can be provided with a logical explanation by our discovery that the release of miRNAs is actively controlled through a ceramide-dependent machinery associated with exosome secretion. This finding can contribute to the development of circulating miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for a variety of diseases. We also demonstrated that secretory miR-16 was transferred into prostate cancer PC-3M cells subcutaneously xenografted in nude mice, resulting in the suppression of its target gene. This result suggests that faithfully to their primary role, secretory miRNAs can function as a translational inhibitor in recipient cells as well. In conclusion, miRNAs are liberated from their incipient cells, whereby they can exert their full potentials as a silence master of gene expressions.	PMC2974086

BMC Cancer	2011	BACKGROUND: Exosomes consist of membrane vesicles that are secreted by several cell types, including tumors and have been found in biological fluids. Exosomes interact with other cells and may serve as vehicles for the transfer of protein and RNA among cells. METHODS: SKOV3 exosomes were labelled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl-ester and collected by ultracentrifugation. Uptake of these vesicles, under different conditions, by the same cells from where they originated was monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. Lectin analysis was performed to investigate the glycosylation properties of proteins from exosomes and cellular extracts. RESULTS: In this work, the ovarian carcinoma SKOV3 cell line has been shown to internalize exosomes from the same cells via several endocytic pathways that were strongly inhibited at 4°C, indicating their energy dependence. Partial colocalization with the endosome marker EEA1 and inhibition by chlorpromazine suggested the involvement of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, uptake inhibition in the presence of 5-ethyl-N-isopropyl amiloride, cytochalasin D and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin suggested the involvement of additional endocytic pathways. The uptake required proteins from the exosomes and from the cells since it was inhibited after proteinase K treatments. The exosomes were found to be enriched in specific mannose- and sialic acid-containing glycoproteins. Sialic acid removal caused a small but non-significant increase in uptake. Furthermore, the monosaccharides D-galactose, α-L-fucose, α-D-mannose, D-N-acetylglucosamine and the disaccharide β-lactose reduced exosomes uptake to a comparable extent as the control D-glucose. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, exosomes are internalized by ovarian tumor cells via various endocytic pathways and proteins from exosomes and cells are required for uptake. On the other hand, exosomes are enriched in specific glycoproteins that may constitute exosome markers. This work contributes to the knowledge about the properties and dynamics of exosomes in cancer.

PLoS One	2011	BACKGROUND: Intercellular communication can occur via the release of membrane vesicles. Exosomes are nanovesicles released from the endosomal compartment of cells. Depending on their cell of origin and their cargo they can exert different immunoregulatory functions. Recently, fungi were found to produce extracellular vesicles that can influence host-microbe interactions. The yeast Malassezia sympodialis which belongs to our normal cutaneous microbial flora elicits specific IgE- and T-cell reactivity in approximately 50% of adult patients with atopic eczema (AE). Whether exosomes or other vesicles contribute to the inflammation has not yet been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if M. sympodialis can release nanovesicles and whether they or endogenous exosomes can activate PBMC from AE patients sensitized to M. sympodialis. METHODS: Extracellular nanovesicles isolated from M. sympodialis, co-cultures of M. sympodialis and dendritic cells, and from plasma of patients with AE and healthy controls (HC) were characterised using flow cytometry, sucrose gradient centrifugation, Western blot and electron microscopy. Their ability to stimulate IL-4 and TNF-alpha responses in autologous CD14, CD34 depleted PBMC was determined using ELISPOT and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: We show for the first time that M. sympodialis releases extracellular vesicles carrying allergen. These vesicles can induce IL-4 and TNF-α responses with a significantly higher IL-4 production in patients compared to HC. Exosomes from dendritic cell and M. sympodialis co-cultures induced IL-4 and TNF-α responses in autologous CD14, CD34 depleted PBMC of AE patients and HC while plasma exosomes induced TNF-α but not IL-4 in undepleted PBMC. CONCLUSIONS: Extracellular vesicles from M. sympodialis, dendritic cells and plasma can contribute to cytokine responses in CD14, CD34 depleted and undepleted PBMC of AE patients and HC. These novel observations have implications for understanding host-microbe interactions in the pathogenesis of AE.	PMC3142114

Hepatic cell-to-cell transmission of small silencing RNA can extend the therapeutic reach of RNA interference (RNAi).	Gut	2012	BACKGROUND/AIMS: RNA interference (RNAi), a sequence-specific gene silencing technology triggered by small interfering RNA (siRNA), represents promising new avenues for treatment of various liver diseases including hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In plants and invertebrates, RNAi provides an important mechanism of cellular defence against viral pathogens and is dependent on the spread of siRNA to neighbouring cells. A study was undertaken to investigate whether vector-delivered RNAi can transfer between hepatic cells in vitro and in mice, and whether this exchange could extend the therapeutic effect of RNAi against HCV infection. METHODS: Transmission of RNAi was investigated in culture by assessing silencing of HCV replication and expression of viral entry receptor CD81 using a human hepatic cell line and primary B lymphocytes transduced with siRNA-expressing vectors. In vivo transmission between hepatic cells was investigated in NOD/SCID mice. Involvement of exosomes was demonstrated by purification, uptake and mass spectrometric analysis. RESULTS: Human and mouse liver cells, as well as primary human B cells, were found to have the ability to exchange small RNAs, including cellular endogenous microRNA and delivered siRNA targeting HCV or CD81. The transmission of RNAi was largely independent of cell contact and partially mediated by exosomes. Evidence of RNAi transmission in vivo was observed in NOD/SCID mice engrafted with human hepatoma cells producing CD81 siRNA, causing suppression of CD81 expression in mouse hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: Both human and mouse hepatic cells exchange small silencing RNAs, partially mediated by shuttling of exosomes. Transmission of siRNA potentially extends the therapeutic reach of RNAi-based therapies against HCV as well as other liver diseases.

Front Physiol	2012	Brain function depends on coordinated interactions between neurons and glial cells. Recent evidence indicates that these cells release endosome-derived microvesicles termed exosomes, which are 50-100 nm in size and carry specific protein and RNA cargo. Exosomes can interact with neighboring cells raising the concept that exosomes may mediate signaling between brain cells and facilitate the delivery of bioactive molecules. Oligodendrocytes myelinate axons and furthermore maintain axonal integrity by an yet uncharacterized pathway of trophic support. Here, we highlight the role of exosomes in nervous system cell communication with particular focus on exosomes released by oligodendrocytes and their potential implications in axon-glia interaction and myelin disease, such as multiple sclerosis. These secreted vesicles may contribute to eliminate overproduced myelin membrane or to transfer antigens facilitating immune surveillance of the brain. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that exosomes participate in axon-glia communication.	PMC3339323

Potential contribution of exosomes to the prion-like propagation of lesions in Alzheimer's disease.	Front Physiol	2012	Since the discovery of prion diseases, the concept has emerged that a protein could be a transmissible pathogen. As such, this transmissible pathogen agent can transfer its pathological mis-folded shape to the same but normally folded protein thus leading to the propagation of a disease. This idea is now extrapolated to several neurological diseases associated with protein mis-folding and aggregation, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a slowly developing dementing disease characterized by the coexistence of two types of lesions: the parenchymal amyloid deposits and the intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Amyloid deposits are composed of amyloid-beta peptides that derive from sequential cleavages of its precursor named amyloid protein precursor. NFT are characterized by intraneuronal aggregation of abnormally modified microtubule-associated Tau proteins. A synergistic relationship between the two lesions may trigger the progression of the disease. Thus, starting in the medial temporal lobe and slowly progressing through temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex, the spreading of NFT is well correlated with clinical expression of the disease and likely follows cortico-cortical neuronal circuitry. However, little is known about the mechanism driving the spatiotemporal propagation of these lesions ultimately leading to the disease. A growing number of studies suggest that amyloid deposits and NFT are resulting from a prion-like spreading. In the present chapter, we will develop the current hypotheses regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving the development and spreading of AD lesions from the window of multivesicular endosomes/bodies and exosomes.

Stem Cells Dev	2013	Bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) ameliorate renal dysfunction and repair tubular damage of acute kidney injury by locally releasing growth factors, including the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The restricted homing of BM-MSC at the site of injury led us to investigate a possible gene-based communication mechanism between BM-MSC and tubular cells. Human BM-MSC (hBM-MSC) released microparticles and exosomes (Exo) enriched in mRNAs. A selected pattern of transcripts was detected in Exo versus parental cells. Exo expressed the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), but not IGF-1 mRNA, while hBM-MSC contained both mRNAs. R- cells lacking IGF-1R exposed to hBM-MSC-derived Exo acquired the human IGF-1R transcript that was translated in the corresponding protein. Transfer of IGF-1R mRNA from Exo to cisplatin-damaged proximal tubular cells (proximal tubular epithelial cell [PTEC]) increased PTEC proliferation. Coincubation of damaged PTEC with Exo and soluble IGF-1 further enhanced cell proliferation. These findings suggest that horizontal transfer of the mRNA for IGF-1R to tubular cells through Exo potentiates tubular cell sensitivity to locally produced IGF-1 providing a new mechanism underlying the powerful renoprotection of few BM-MSC observed in vivo.

Human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells secrete functional neprilysin-bound exosomes.	Sci Rep	2013	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in the brain because of an imbalance between Aβ production and clearance. Neprilysin (NEP) is the most important Aβ-degrading enzyme in the brain. Thus, researchers have explored virus-mediated NEP gene delivery. However, such strategies may entail unexpected risks, and thus exploration of a new possibility for NEP delivery is also required. Here, we show that human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) secrete exosomes carrying enzymatically active NEP. The NEP-specific activity level of 1 μg protein from ADSC-derived exosomes was equivalent to that of ~ 0.3 ng of recombinant human NEP. Of note, ADSC-derived exosomes were transferred into N2a cells, and were suggested to decrease both secreted and intracellular Aβ levels in the N2a cells. Importantly, these characteristics were more pronounced in ADSCs than bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, suggesting the therapeutic relevance of ADSC-derived exosomes for AD.	PMC3561625

Analyzing the circulating microRNAs in exosomes/extracellular vesicles from serum or plasma by qRT-PCR.	Methods Mol Biol	2013	Small extracellular vesicles are released from both healthy and disease cells to facilitate cellular communication. They have a wide variety of names including exosomes, microvesicles and microparticles. Depending on their size, very small extracellular vesicles originating from the endocytic pathway have been called exosomes and in some cases nanovesicles. Collectively, extracellular vesicles are important mediators of a wide variety of functions including immune cell development and homeostasis. Encapsulated in the extracellular vesicles are proteins and nucleic acids including mRNA and microRNA molecules. MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNA molecules implicated in the post-transcriptional control of gene expression that have emerged as important regulatory molecules and are involved in disease pathogenesis including cancer. In some diseases, not only does the quantity and the subpopulations of extracellular vesicles change in the peripheral blood but also microRNAs. Here, we described the analysis of peripheral blood extracellular vesicles by flow cytometry and the RNA extraction from extracellular vesicles isolated from the plasma or serum to profile microRNA expression.

From structures to diagnosis and treatment.	Methods	2014	Olive tree is one of the main allergy sources in Mediterranean countries. The identification of the allergenic repertoire from olive pollen has been essential for the development of rational strategies of standardization, diagnosis, and immunotherapy, all of them focused to increase the life quality of the patients. From its complex allergogram, twelve allergens - Ole e 1 to Ole e 12 - have been identified and characterized to date. Most of them have been cloned and produced as recombinant forms, whose availability have allowed analyzing their three-dimensional structures, mapping their T-cell and B-cell epitopes, and determining the precise allergenic profile of patients for a subsequent patient-tailored immunotherapy. Protein mutant, hypoallergenic derivatives, or recombinant fragments have been also useful experimental tools to analyze the immune recognition of allergens. To test these molecules before using them for clinic purposes, a mouse model of allergic sensitizations has been used. This model has been helpful for assaying different prophylactic approaches based on tolerance induction by intranasal administration of allergens or hypoallergens, used as free or integrated in different delivery systems, and their findings suggest a promising utilization as nasal vaccines. Exosomes - nanovesicles isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of tolerogenic mice - have shown immunomodulatory properties, being able to protect mice against sensitization to Ole e 1.

CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells-derived exosomes prolonged kidney allograft survival in a rat model.	Cell Immunol	2013 Sep-Oct	CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are negative regulators of the immune system that induce and maintain immune tolerance. Exosomes are natural products released from many sources and play a role in antigen presentation, immunoregulation, and signal transduction. In order to determine whether exosomes can be released from Tregs and participate in transplantation tolerance, we isolated and purified Tregs-derived exosomes and established a rat model of kidney transplantation. We then transferred the autologous exosomes into recipients to observe the effect of transplantation tolerance in vivo and in vitro. From in vivo study, serum analysis and histology showed that the function of exosomes can postpone allograft rejection and prolong the survival time of transplanted kidney. From in vitro study, exosomes possessed the capacity to suppress T cells proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that the Tregs-derived exosomes have a suppressive role on acute rejection and inhibit T cells proliferation, especially exosomes derived from donor-type Tregs, which imply that the Tregs-derived exosomes are one of far-end regulation mechanisms of Tregs. Thus, exosomes released from Tregs could be considered as a possible immunosuppressive reagent for the treatment of transplant rejection.

Body fluid exosomes promote secretion of inflammatory cytokines in monocytic cells via Toll-like receptor signaling.	J Biol Chem	2013	Tumor-derived exosomes have been shown to induce various immunomodulatory effects. However, the underlying signaling pathways are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the effects of ex vivo-derived exosomes on monocytic cell differentiation/activation using THP-1 cells as model. We isolated exosomes from various body fluids such as amniotic fluid, liver cirrhosis ascites, and malignant ascites of ovarian cancer patients. We observed that exosomes were internalized by THP-1 cells and induced the production of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6. Analysis of the signaling pathways revealed a fast triggering of NFκB and a delayed activation of STAT3. Pharmacologic and antibody-blocking experiments showed that the initial production of IL-6 was instrumental for subsequent activation of STAT3. Importantly, triggering of cell signaling was not a unique property of tumor exosomes but was also observed with exosomes of noncancerous origin. Exosomal signaling was TLR-dependent as the knockdown of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 blocked NFκB and STAT3 activation. Similar results were obtained with TLR-neutralizing antibodies. Exosomes also triggered the release of cytokines from mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells or macrophages. This process was MyD88-dependent, further supporting a role of TLR signaling. Our results suggest that exosomes trigger TLR-dependent signaling pathways in monocytic precursor cells but possibly also in other immune cells. This process could be important for the induction of immunosuppressive mechanisms during cancer progression and inflammatory diseases.	PMC3868779

Proteomic analysis of C2C12 myoblast and myotube exosome-like vesicles: a new paradigm for myoblast-myotube cross talk?	PLoS One	2014	Exosomes are nanometer-sized microvesicles formed in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) during endosome maturation. Exosomes are released from cells into the microenvironment following fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane. During the last decade, skeletal muscle-secreted proteins have been identified with important roles in intercellular communications. To investigate whether muscle-derived exosomes participate in this molecular dialog, we determined and compared the protein contents of the exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) released from C2C12 murine myoblasts during proliferation (ELV-MB), and after differentiation into myotubes (ELV-MT). Using a proteomic approach combined with electron microscopy, western-blot and bioinformatic analyses, we compared the protein repertoires within ELV-MB and ELV-MT. We found that these vesicles displayed the classical properties of exosomes isolated from other cell types containing components of the ESCRT machinery of the MVBs, as well as numerous tetraspanins. Specific muscle proteins were also identified confirming that ELV composition also reflects their muscle origin. Furthermore quantitative analysis revealed stage-preferred expression of 31 and 78 proteins in ELV-MB and ELV-MT respectively. We found that myotube-secreted ELVs, but not ELV-MB, reduced myoblast proliferation and induced differentiation, through, respectively, the down-regulation of Cyclin D1 and the up-regulation of myogenin. We also present evidence that proteins from ELV-MT can be incorporated into myoblasts by using the GFP protein as cargo within ELV-MT. Taken together, our data provide a useful database of proteins from C2C12-released ELVs throughout myogenesis and reveals the importance of exosome-like vesicles in skeletal muscle biology.

Cardiovasc Diabetol	2014	BACKGROUND: Alterations in extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microparticles, contribute to cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that obesity could favour enhanced release of EVs from adipose tissue, and thereby contribute to cardiovascular risk via obesity-induced metabolic complications. The objectives of this study were: 1) to investigate the relation between the quantity, distribution and (dys) function of adipose tissue and plasma concentrations of atherothrombotic EV-markers; 2) to determine the relation between these EV-markers and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome; and 3) to assess the contribution of EV markers to the risk of incident type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In 1012 patients with clinically manifest vascular disease, subcutaneous and visceral fat thickness was measured ultrasonographically. Plasma EVs were isolated and levels of cystatin C, serpin G1, serpin F2 and CD14 were measured, as well as fasting metabolic parameters, hsCRP and adiponectin. The association between adiposity, EV-markers, and metabolic syndrome was tested by multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses. As sex influences body fat distribution, sex-stratified analyses between adipose tissue distribution and EV-markers were performed. The relation between EV-markers and type 2 diabetes was assessed with Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Higher levels of hsCRP (β 5.59; 95% CI 3.00-8.18) and lower HDL-cholesterol levels (β-11.26; 95% CI -18.39 - -4.13) were related to increased EV-cystatin C levels, and EV-cystatin C levels were associated with a 57% higher odds of having the metabolic syndrome (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.19-2.27). HDL-cholesterol levels were positively related to EV-CD14 levels (β 5.04; 95% CI 0.07-10.0), and EV-CD14 levels were associated with a relative risk reduction of 16% for development of type 2 diabetes (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.94), during a median follow up of 6.5 years in which 42 patients developed type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with clinically manifest vascular disease, EV-cystatin C levels were positively related, and EV-CD14 levels were negatively related to metabolic complications of obesity.

Cell Commun Signal	2014	BACKGROUND: Several studies demonstrate the role of adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) in angiogenesis. The angiogenic mechanism has been ascribed to paracrine factors since these cells secrete a plenty of signal molecules and growth factors. Recently it has been suggested that besides soluble factors, extracellular vesicles (EVs) that include exosomes and microvesicles may play a major role in cell-to-cell communication. It has been shown that EVs are implicated in the angiogenic process. RESULTS: Herein we studied whether EVs released by ASCs may mediate the angiogenic activity of these cells. Our results demonstrated that ASC-derived EVs induced in vitro vessel-like structure formation by human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC). EV-stimulated HMEC when injected subcutaneously within Matrigel in SCID mice formed vessels. Treatment of ASCs with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulated the secretion of EVs, changed their protein composition and enhanced the angiogenic potential. At variance of EVs released in basal conditions, PDGF-EVs carried c-kit and SCF that played a role in angiogenesis as specific blocking antibodies inhibited in vitro vessel-like structure formation. The enhanced content of matrix metalloproteinases in PDGF-EVs may also account for their angiogenic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that EVs released by ASCs may contribute to the ASC-induced angiogenesis and suggest that PDGF may trigger the release of EVs with an enhanced angiogenic potential.

Interspecies communication between plant and mouse gut host cells through edible plant derived exosome-like nanoparticles.	Mol Nutr Food Res	2014	SCOPE: Exosomes, small vesicles participating in intercellular communication, have been extensively studied recently; however, the role of edible plant derived exosomes in interspecies communication has not been investigated. Here, we investigate the biological effects of edible plant derived exosome-like nanoparticles (EPDENs) on mammalian cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, exosome-like nanoparticles from four edible plants were isolated and characterized. We show that these EPDENs contain proteins, lipids, and microRNA. EPDENs are taken up by intestinal macrophages and stem cells. The results generated from EPDEN-transfected macrophages indicate that ginger EPDENs preferentially induce the expression of the antioxidation gene, heme oxygenase-1 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10; whereas grapefruit, ginger, and carrot EPDENs promote activation of nuclear factor like (erythroid-derived 2). Furthermore, analysis of the intestines of canonical Wnt-reporter mice, i.e. B6.Cg-Tg(BAT-lacZ)3Picc/J mice, revealed that the numbers of β-galactosidase(+) (β-Gal) intestinal crypts are increased, suggesting that EPDEN treatment of mice leads to Wnt-mediated activation of the TCF4 transcription machinery in the crypts. CONCLUSION: The data suggest a role for EPDEN-mediated interspecies communication by inducing expression of genes for anti-inflammation cytokines, antioxidation, and activation of Wnt signaling, which are crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis.

Regulation of HIV-Gag expression and targeting to the endolysosomal/secretory pathway by the luminal domain of lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP-1) enhance Gag-specific immune response.	PLoS One	2014	We have previously demonstrated that a DNA vaccine encoding HIV-p55gag in association with the lysosomal associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) elicited a greater Gag-specific immune response, in comparison to a DNA encoding the native gag. In vitro studies have also demonstrated that LAMP/Gag was highly expressed and was present in MHCII containing compartments in transfected cells. In this study, the mechanisms involved in these processes and the relative contributions of the increased expression and altered traffic for the enhanced immune response were addressed. Cells transfected with plasmid DNA constructs containing p55gag attached to truncated sequences of LAMP-1 showed that the increased expression of gag mRNA required p55gag in frame with at least 741 bp of the LAMP-1 luminal domain. LAMP luminal domain also showed to be essential for Gag traffic through lysosomes and, in this case, the whole sequence was required. Further analysis of the trafficking pathway of the intact LAMP/Gag chimera demonstrated that it was secreted, at least in part, associated with exosome-like vesicles. Immunization of mice with LAMP/gag chimeric plasmids demonstrated that high expression level alone can induce a substantial transient antibody response, but targeting of the antigen to the endolysosomal/secretory pathways was required for establishment of cellular and memory response. The intact LAMP/gag construct induced polyfunctional CD4+ T cell response, which presence at the time of immunization was required for CD8+ T cell priming. LAMP-mediated targeting to endolysosomal/secretory pathway is an important new mechanistic element in LAMP-mediated enhanced immunity with applications to the development of novel anti-HIV vaccines and to general vaccinology field.

Liver Int	2015	BACKGROUND & AIMS: miR-122 is the most abundant miRNA in the liver particularly in hepatocytes where it targets cholesterol metabolism. Steatosis, a key component of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Here, we hypothesized that reduced miR-122 has a pathogenic role in steatohepatitis. METHODS: miR-122 and its target genes were evaluated in mouse livers and/or isolated hepatocytes after methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) or methionine-choline-supplemented (MCS) diet. RESULTS: Liver and hepatocyte miR-122 expression was significantly decreased in steatohepatitis. A maximum reduction in miR-122 occurred at the fibrosis stage (8 weeks of MCD diet). MAP3K3, a miR-122 target gene, was induced at all stages of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; 3-8 weeks) only at the mRNA level. Increased NF-κB activation was found in MCD diet-fed mice and MAP3K3 regulated the NF-κB DNA binding in naive hepatocytes. HIF-1α mRNA and DNA binding and expression of the HIF-1α target gene, profibrotic lysyl oxidase, was increased in advanced steatohepatitis (8 weeks). In addition, increase in vimentin and Sirius red staining (liver fibrosis) was found at 8 weeks of MCD diet. Using miR-122 overexpression and inhibition approaches, we confirmed that HIF-1α, vimentin and MAP3K3 are novel miR-122 targets in hepatocytes. We report transcriptional repression of miR-122 in NASH. Decreased liver miR-122 was associated with elevated circulating miR-122 in both exosome-rich and protein-rich serum fractions. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel data suggest that decreased liver miR-122 contributes to upregulation of modulators of tissue remodelling (HIF-1α, vimentin and MAP3K3) and might play a role in NASH-induced liver fibrosis.

Exosome poly-ubiquitin inhibits platelet activation, downregulates CD36 and inhibits pro-atherothombotic cellular functions.	J Thromb Haemost	2014	INTRODUCTION: Activated platelets shed microparticles from plasma membranes, but also release smaller exosomes from internal compartments. While microparticles participate in athero-thrombosis, little is known of exosomes in this process. MATERIALS & METHODS: Ex vivo biochemical experiments with human platelets and exosomes, and FeCl3 -induced murine carotid artery thrombosis. RESULTS: Both microparticles and exosomes were abundant in human plasma. Platelet-derived exosomes suppressed ex vivo platelet aggregation and reduced adhesion to collagen-coated microfluidic channels at high shear. Injected exosomes inhibited occlusive thrombosis in FeCl3 -damaged murine carotid arteries. Control platelets infused into irradiated, thrombocytopenic mice reconstituted thrombosis in damaged carotid arteries, but failed to do so after prior ex vivo incubation with exosomes.CD36 promotes platelet activation, and exosomes dramatically reduced platelet CD36.CD36 is also expressed by macrophages, where it binds and internalizes oxidized LDL and microparticles, supplying lipid to promote foam cell formation. Platelet exosomes inhibited oxidized-LDL binding and cholesterol loading into macrophages. Exosomes were not competitive CD36 ligands, but instead sharply reduced total macrophage CD36 content. Exosomal proteins, in contrast to microparticle or cellular proteins, were highly adducted by ubiquitin. Exosomes enhanced ubiquitination of cellular proteins, including CD36, and blockade of proteosome proteolysis with MG-132 rescued CD36 expression. Recombinant unanchored K48 poly-ubiquitin behaved similarly to exosomes, inhibiting platelet function, macrophage CD36 expression and macrophage particle uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet-derived exosomes inhibit athero-thrombotic processes by reducing CD36-dependent lipid loading of macrophages and by suppressing platelet thrombosis. Exosomes increase protein ubiquitination and enhance proteasome degradation of CD36.	PMC4229405

Electronic address: .	zjulipingcao@163.com		Pancreatic cancer derived exosomes regulate the expression of TLR4 in dendritic cells via miR-203.	Cell Immunol	2014 Nov-Dec	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are aberrant in many human tumors which can be transferred to immune cells by tumor-derived exosomes. Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in activation of immune response. However, the effect of tumor-derived exosomes on toll-like receptor (TLR) in DCs remains unclear. We investigated the influence of pancreatic cancer derived exosomes on TLR4, and downstream cytokines via miR-203. Our results showed that miR-203 expressed in panc-1 cells and exosomes, and upregulated in exosomes-treated DCs. TLR4 decreased after treatment of exosomes and miR-203 mimics, while increased in exosomes-treated DCs by miR-203 inhibitors. But the mRNA level of TLR4 was not significantly different between DCs and exosomes-treated DCs. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) also decreased under treatment of exosomes and miR-203 mimics, both of which increased in exosomes-treated DCs by miR-203 inhibitors. Collectively, pancreatic cancer derived exosomes downregulate TLR4 and downstream cytokines in DCs via miR-203.

Circulating extracellular vesicles with specific proteome and liver microRNAs are potential biomarkers for liver injury in experimental fatty liver disease.	PLoS One	2014	BACKGROUND & AIM: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in both adult and children. Currently there are no reliable methods to determine disease severity, monitor disease progression, or efficacy of therapy, other than an invasive liver biopsy. DESIGN: Choline Deficient L-Amino Acid (CDAA) and high fat diets were used as physiologically relevant mouse models of NAFLD. Circulating extracellular vesicles were isolated, fully characterized by proteomics and molecular analyses and compared to control groups. Liver-related microRNAs were isolated from purified extracellular vesicles and liver specimens. RESULTS: We observed statistically significant differences in the level of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in liver and blood between two control groups and NAFLD animals. Time-course studies showed that EV levels increase early during disease development and reflect changes in liver histolopathology. EV levels correlated with hepatocyte cell death (r2 = 0.64, p<0.05), fibrosis (r2 = 0.66, p<0.05) and pathological angiogenesis (r2 = 0.71, p<0.05). Extensive characterization of blood EVs identified both microparticles (MPs) and exosomes (EXO) present in blood of NAFLD animals. Proteomic analysis of blood EVs detected various differentially expressed proteins in NAFLD versus control animals. Moreover, unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified a signature that allowed for discrimination between NAFLD and controls. Finally, the liver appears to be an important source of circulating EVs in NAFLD animals as evidenced by the enrichment in blood with miR-122 and 192--two microRNAs previously described in chronic liver diseases, coupled with a corresponding decrease in expression of these microRNAs in the liver. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential for using specific circulating EVs as sensitive and specific biomarkers for the noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of NAFLD.	PMC4254757
25594326	Ye Xiong	Departments of 1 Neurosurgery and.			Effect of exosomes derived from multipluripotent mesenchymal stromal cells on functional recovery and neurovascular plasticity in rats after traumatic brain injury.	J Neurosurg	2015	OBJECT: Transplanted multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) improve functional recovery in rats after traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study the authors tested a novel hypothesis that systemic administration of cell-free exosomes generated from MSCs promotes functional recovery and neurovascular remodeling in rats after TBI. METHODS: Two groups of 8 Wistar rats were subjected to TBI, followed 24 hours later by tail vein injection of 100 μg protein of exosomes derived from MSCs or an equal volume of vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline). A third group of 8 rats was used as sham-injured, sham-treated controls. To evaluate cognitive and sensorimotor functional recovery, the modified Morris water maze, modified Neurological Severity Score, and foot-fault tests were performed. Animals were killed at 35 days after TBI. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed for measurements of lesion volume, neurovascular remodeling (angiogenesis and neurogenesis), and neuroinflammation. RESULTS: Compared with the saline-treated group, exosome-treated rats with TBI showed significant improvement in spatial learning at 34-35 days as measured by the modified Morris water maze test (p < 0.05), and sensorimotor functional recovery (i.e., reduced neurological deficits and foot-fault frequency) was observed at 14-35 days postinjury (p < 0.05). Exosome treatment significantly increased the number of newly generated endothelial cells in the lesion boundary zone and dentate gyrus and significantly increased the number of newly formed immature and mature neurons in the dentate gyrus as well as reducing neuroinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrate for the first time that MSC-generated exosomes effectively improve functional recovery, at least in part, by promoting endogenous angiogenesis and neurogenesis and by reducing inflammation in rats after TBI. Thus, MSC-generated exosomes may provide a novel cell-free therapy for TBI and possibly for other neurological diseases.	PMC4382456

Exosomes released from breast cancer carcinomas stimulate cell movement.	PLoS One	2015	For metastasis to occur cells must communicate with to their local environment to initiate growth and invasion. Exosomes have emerged as an important mediator of cell-to-cell signalling through the transfer of molecules such as mRNAs, microRNAs, and proteins between cells. Exosomes have been proposed to act as regulators of cancer progression. Here, we study the effect of exosomes on cell migration, an important step in metastasis. We performed cell migration assays, endocytosis assays, and exosome proteomic profiling on exosomes released from three breast cancer cell lines that model progressive stages of metastasis. Results from these experiments suggest: (1) exosomes promote cell migration and (2) the signal is stronger from exosomes isolated from cells with higher metastatic potentials; (3) exosomes are endocytosed at the same rate regardless of the cell type; (4) exosomes released from cells show differential enrichment of proteins with unique protein signatures of both identity and abundance. We conclude that breast cancer cells of increasing metastatic potential secrete exosomes with distinct protein signatures that proportionally increase cell movement and suggest that released exosomes could play an active role in metastasis.

Exosomes are unlikely involved in intercellular Nef transfer.	PLoS One	2015	HIV-1 Nef is an important pathogenic factor for HIV/AIDS pathogenesis. Several recent studies including ours have demonstrated that Nef can be transferred to neighboring cells and alters the function of these cells. However, how the intercellular Nef transfer occurs is in dispute. In the current study, we attempted to address this important issue using several complementary strategies, a panel of exosomal markers, and human CD4+ T lymphocyte cell line Jurkat and a commonly used cell line 293T. First, we showed that Nef was transferred from Nef-expressing or HIV-infected Jurkat to naïve Jurkat and other non-Jurkat cells and that the transfer required the membrane targeting function of Nef and was cell density-dependent. Then, we showed that Nef transfer was cell-cell contact-dependent, as exposure to culture supernatants or exosomes from HIV-infected Jurkat or Nef-expressing Jurkat and 293T led to little Nef detection in the target cells Jurkat. Thirdly, we demonstrated that Nef was only detected to be associated with HIV virions but not with acetylcholinesterase (AChE+) exosomes from HIV-infected Jurkat and not in the exosomes from Nef-expressing Jurkat. In comparison, when it was over-expressed in 293T, Nef was detected in detergent-insoluble AChE+/CD81 low/TSG101 low exosomes, but not in detergent-soluble AChE-/CD81 high/TSG101 high exosomes. Lastly, microscopic imaging showed no significant Nef detection in exosomal vesicle-like structures in and out 293T. Taken together, these results show that exosomes are unlikely involved in intercellular Nef transfer. In addition, this study reveals existence of two types of exosomes: AChE+/CD81 low/TSG101 low exosomes and AChE-/CD81 high/TSG101 high exosomes.	PMC4412529

Electronic address: .	achiesi@exosomics.eu		Integrated isolation and quantitative analysis of exosome shuttled proteins and nucleic acids using immunocapture approaches.	Methods	2015	Clinical implementation of exosome based diagnostic and therapeutic applications is still limited by the lack of standardized technologies that integrate efficient isolation of exosomes with comprehensive detection of relevant biomarkers. Conventional methods for exosome isolation based on their physical properties such as size and density (filtration, ultracentrifugation or density gradient), or relying on their differential solubility (chemical precipitation) are established primarily for processing of cell supernatants and later adjusted to complex biological samples such as plasma. Though still representing gold standard in the field, these methods are clearly suboptimal for processing of routine clinical samples and have intrinsic limits that impair their use in biomarker discovery and development of novel diagnostics. Immunoisolation (IA) offers unique advantages for the recovery of exosomes from complex and viscous fluids, in terms of increased efficiency and specificity of exosome capture, integrity and selective origin of isolated vesicles. We have evaluated several commercially available solutions for immunoplate- and immunobead-based affinity isolation and have further optimized protocols to decrease non-specific binding due to exosomes complexity and matrix contaminants. In order to identify best molecular targets for total exosome capture from diverse biological sources, as well as for selective enrichment in populations of interest (e.g. tumor derived exosomes) several exosome displayed proteins and respective antibodies have been evaluated for plate and bead functionalisation. Moreover, we have optimized and directly implemented downstream steps allowing on-line quantification and characterization of bound exosome markers, namely proteins and RNAs. Thus assembled assays enabled rapid overall quantification and validation of specific exosome associated targets in/on plasma exosomes, with multifold increased yield and enrichment ratio over benchmarking technologies. Assays directly coupling selective immobilization of exosomes to a solid phase and their immune- and or molecular profiling through conventional ELISA and PCR analysis, resulted in easy-to-elaborate, quantitative readouts, with high low-end sensitivity and dynamic range, low costs and hands-on time, minimal sample handling and downscaling of a working plasma volumes to as few as 100 μl.

Biochim Biophys Acta	2015	Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a common primary malignant tumor of bile duct epithelia, is highly prevalent in Asian countries and unresponsive to chemotherapeutic drugs. Thus, a newly recognized biological entity for early diagnosis and treatment is highly needed. Exosomes are small membrane bound vesicles found in body fluids and released by most cell types including cancer cells. The vesicles contain specific subset of proteins and nucleic acids corresponding to cell types and play essential roles in pathophysiological processes. The present study aimed to assess the protein profiles of CCA-derived exosomes and their potential roles. We have isolated exosomes from CCA cells namely KKU-M213 and KKU-100 derived from Thai patients and their roles were investigated by incubation with normal human cholangiocyte (H69) cells. Exosomes were internalized into H69 cells and had no effects on viability or proliferation of the host cells. Interestingly, the exosomes from KKU-M213 cells only induced migration and invasion of H69 cells. Proteomic analysis of the exosomes from KKU-M213 cells disclosed multiple cancer related proteins that are not present in H69 exosomes. Consistent with the protein profile, treatment with KKU-M213 exosomes induced β-catenin and reduced E-cadherin expressions in H69 cells. Collectively, our results suggest that a direct cell-to-cell transfer of oncogenic proteins via exosomal pathway may be a novel mechanism for CCA progression and metastasis.

Tumour Biol	2016	A new recombinant construct made up of two components, texosomes (TEX) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), showed cytostatic properties against several types of tumor cells in vitro. Here, we aimed to assess the construct's antitumor immunogenicity in a murine tumor model. SEB was anchored onto purified texosomes and was used for immunization of mice before challenge with 4T1 cells. Tumor size, survival time, necrosis, metastasis rate, and the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-17, IL-12, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were measured. Immunization of the mice with TEX-SEB increased the stimulation index of splenocytes significantly compared with the PBS-treated mice (p < 0.01). In addition, there was a significant increase of TNF-α, IL-2, and IFN-γ secreted from isolated splenocytes of the mice immunized by either TEX-SEB, TEX + SEB, TEX, or SEB in comparison with PBS (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p < 0.05, respectively), whereas no significant change of IL-4 secretion was observed in any treated groups. Finding from tumor tissue homogenate testing showed that the level of IL-17 and IFN-γ among mice immunized with TEX-SEB was significantly lower than PBS-treated group (p < 0.05). IL-12, IL-4, and TNF-α levels were not significantly different from PBS- and TEX-SEB-immunized groups except in the SEB-immunized mice. Although TEX-SEB immunization relatively prolonged the survival of the mice, it had no inhibitory impact on tumor size. Pathologic manifestations showed the significant rise of necrosis after immunization with TEX-SEB compared to PBS (p < 0.01). Overall, our findings suggest that the presence of SEB rescues tumorigenesis effects of TEX making the construct an appropriate candidate for tumor immunotherapy.

Electronic address: .	marjo.yliperttula@helsinki.fi		Microvesicle- and exosome-mediated drug delivery enhances the cytotoxicity of Paclitaxel in autologous prostate cancer cells.	J Control Release	2015	BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are naturally occurring membrane particles that mediate intercellular communication by delivering molecular information between cells. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of two different populations of EVs (microvesicle- and exosome-enriched) as carriers of Paclitaxel to autologous prostate cancer cells. METHODS: EVs were isolated from LNCaP- and PC-3 prostate cancer cell cultures using differential centrifugation and characterized by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western blot. The uptake of microvesicles and exosomes by the autologous prostate cancer cells was assessed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The EVs were loaded with Paclitaxel and the effectiveness of EV-mediated drug delivery was assessed with viability assays. The distribution of EVs and EV-delivered Paclitaxel in cells was inspected by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Our main finding was that the loading of Paclitaxel to autologous prostate cancer cell-derived EVs increased its cytotoxic effect. This capacity was independent of the EV population and the cell line tested. Although the EVs without the drug increased cancer cell viability, the net effect of enhanced cytotoxicity remained. Both EV populations delivered Paclitaxel to the recipient cells through endocytosis, leading to the release of the drug from within the cells. The removal of EV surface proteins did not affect exosomes, while the drug delivery mediated by microvesicles was partially inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer cell-derived EVs can be used as effective carriers of Paclitaxel to their parental cells, bringing the drug into the cells through an endocytic pathway and increasing its cytotoxicity. However, due to the increased cell viability, the use of cancer cell-derived EVs must be further investigated before any clinical applications can be designed.

Curcumin Mitigates the Intracellular Lipid Deposit Induced by Antipsychotics In Vitro.	PLoS One	2015	SCOPE: First- and second-generation antipsychotics (FGAs and SGAs, respectively), both inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis and impair the intracellular cholesterol trafficking, leading to lipid accumulation in the late endosome/lysosome compartment. In this study we examined if curcumin, a plant polyphenol that stimulates exosome release, can alleviate antipsychotic-induced intracellular lipid accumulation. METHODS: HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells were treated with antipsychotics or placebo and DiI-labelled LDL for 18 h and then exposed to curcumin for the last 2 h. Cells and media were collected separately and used for biochemical analyses, electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Exosomes were isolated from the incubation medium by ultracentrifugation. RESULTS: Curcumin treatment reduced the number of heterolysosomes and shifted their subcellular localization to the periphery, as revealed by electron microscopy, and stimulated the release of lysosomal β-hexosaminidase and exosome markers flotillin-2 and CD63 into the media. The presence of DiI in exosomes released by cells preloaded with DiI-LDL demonstrated the endolysosomal origin of the microvesicles. Furthermore, curcumin increased the secretion of cholesterol as well as LDL-derived DiI and [3H]-cholesterol, in association with a decrease of intracellular lipids. Thus, the disruption of lipid trafficking induced by FGAs or SGAs can be relieved by curcumin treatment. This polyphenol, however, did not mitigate the reduction of cholesterol esterification induced by antipsychotics. CONCLUSION: Curcumin stimulates exosome release to remove cholesterol (and presumably other lipids) accumulated within the endolysosomal compartment, thereby normalizing intracellular lipid homeostasis. This action may help minimize the adverse metabolic effects of antipsychotic treatment, which should now be evaluated in clinical trials.	PMC4627744

J Neurovirol	2016	The negative factor (Nef) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an accessory protein that is thought to be integral to HIV-associated immune- and neuroimmune pathogenesis. Here, we show that nef-transfected microglia-released Nef+ exosome (exNef) disrupts the apical blood-brain barrier (BBB) and that only nef-transfected microglia release Nef in exosomes. nef-gfp-transduced neurons and astrocytes release exosomes but did not release exNef in the extracellular space. Apical administration of exNef derived from nef-transfected 293T cells reduced transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased permeability of the BBB. Microglia-derived exNef applied to either the apical/basal BBB significantly reduced expression of the tight junction protein, ZO-1, suggesting a mechanism of exNef-mediated neuropathogenesis. Microglia exposed to exNef release elevated levels of Toll-like receptor-induced cytokines and chemokines IL-12, IL-8, IL-6, RANTES, and IL-17A. Magnetic nanoparticle delivery of Nef peptides containing the Nef myrisolation site across an in vitro BBB ultimately reduced nef-transfected microglia release of Nef exosomes and prevented the loss of BBB integrity and permeability as measured by TEER and dextran-FITC transport studies, respectively. Overall, we show that exNef is released from nef-gfp-transfected microglia; exNef disrupts integrity and permeability, and tight junctions of the BBB, and induces microglial cytokine/chemokine secretion. These exNef-mediated effects were significantly restricted by Nef peptides. Taken together, this study provides preliminary evidence of the role of exNef in HIV neuroimmune pathogenesis and the feasibility of a nanomedicine-based therapeutics targeting exNef to treat HIV-associated neuropathogenesis.

Diabetes	2016	Although there is significant interest in elucidating the role of placenta-derived exosomes (PdEs) during pregnancy, the exosomal profile in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains to be established. The aim of this study was to compare the gestational-age profile of PdEs in maternal plasma of GDM with normal pregnancies and to determine the effect of exosomes on cytokine release from human umbilical vein endothelial cells. A prospective cohort of patients was sampled at three time points during pregnancy for each patient (i.e., 11-14, 22-24, and 32-36 weeks' gestation). A retrospective stratified study design was used to quantify exosomes present in maternal plasma of normal (n = 13) and GDM (n = 7) pregnancies. Gestational age and pregnancy status were identified as significant factors contributing to variation in plasma exosome concentration (ANOVA, P < 0.05). Post hoc analyses established that PdE concentration increased during gestation in both normal and GDM pregnancies; however, the increase was significantly greater in GDM (∼2.2-fold, ∼1.5-fold, and ∼1.8-fold greater at each gestational age compared with normal pregnancies). Exosomes isolated from GDM pregnancies significantly increased the release of proinflammatory cytokines from endothelial cells. Although the role of exosomes during GDM remains to be fully elucidated, exosome profiles may be of diagnostic utility for screening asymptomatic populations.

The Zinc-Finger Protein SOP1 Is Required for a Subset of the Nuclear Exosome Functions in Arabidopsis.	PLoS Genet	2016	Correct gene expression requires tight RNA quality control both at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Using a splicing-defective allele of PASTICCINO2 (PAS2), a gene essential for plant development, we isolated suppressor mutations modifying pas2-1 mRNA profiles and restoring wild-type growth. Three suppressor of pas2 (sop) mutations modified the degradation of mis-spliced pas2-1 mRNA species, allowing the synthesis of a functional protein. Cloning of the suppressor mutations identified the core subunit of the exosome SOP2/RRP4, the exosome nucleoplasmic cofactor SOP3/HEN2 and a novel zinc-finger protein SOP1 that colocalizes with HEN2 in nucleoplasmic foci. The three SOP proteins counteract post-transcriptional (trans)gene silencing (PTGS), which suggests that they all act in RNA quality control. In addition, sop1 mutants accumulate some, but not all of the misprocessed mRNAs and other types of RNAs that are observed in exosome mutants. Taken together, our data show that SOP1 is a new component of nuclear RNA surveillance that is required for the degradation of a specific subset of nuclear exosome targets.	PMC4735120

Electronic address: .	blu2@scu.edu		Development of exosome surface display technology in living human cells.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2016	Surface display technology is an emerging key player in presenting functional proteins for targeted drug delivery and therapy. Although a number of technologies exist, a desirable mammalian surface display system is lacking. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that facilitate cell-cell communication and can be engineered as nano-shuttles for cell-specific delivery. In this study, we report the development of a novel exosome surface display technology by exploiting mammalian cell secreted nano-vesicles and their trans-membrane protein tetraspanins. By constructing a set of fluorescent reporters for both the inner and outer surface display on exosomes at two selected sites of tetraspanins, we demonstrated the successful exosomal display via gene transfection and monitoring fluorescence in vivo. We subsequently validated our system by demonstrating the expected intracellular partitioning of reporter protein into sub-cellular compartments and secretion of exosomes from human HEK293 cells. Lastly, we established the stable engineered cells to harness the ability of this robust system for continuous production, secretion, and uptake of displayed exosomes with minimal impact on human cell biology. In sum, our work paved the way for potential applications of exosome, including exosome tracking and imaging, targeted drug delivery, as well as exosome-mediated vaccine and therapy.

Oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelium cells increases exosome secretion and promotes angiogenesis in endothelial cells.	J Cell Mol Med	2016	The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a monolayer located between the photoreceptors and the choroid, is constantly damaged by oxidative stress, particularly because of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As the RPE, because of its physiological functions, is essential for the survival of the retina, any sustained damage may consequently lead to loss of vision. Exosomes are small membranous vesicles released into the extracellular medium by numerous cell types, including RPE cells. Their cargo includes genetic material and proteins, making these vesicles essential for cell-to-cell communication. Exosomes may fuse with neighbouring cells influencing their fate. It has been observed that RPE cells release higher amounts of exosomes when they are under oxidative stress. Exosomes derived from cultured RPE cells were isolated by ultracentrifugation and quantified by flow cytometry. VEGF receptors (VEGFR) were analysed by both flow cytometry and Western blot. RT-PCR and qPCR were conducted to assess mRNA content of VEGFRs in exosomes. Neovascularization assays were performed after applying RPE exosomes into endothelial cell cultures. Our results showed that stressed RPE cells released a higher amount of exosomes than controls, with a higher expression of VEGFR in the membrane, and enclosed an extra cargo of VEGFR mRNA. Angiogenesis assays confirmed that endothelial cells increased their tube formation capacity when exposed to stressed RPE exosomes.	PMC4956947

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells improve diabetes-induced cognitive impairment by exosome transfer into damaged neurons and astrocytes.	Sci Rep	2016	The incidence of dementia is higher in diabetic patients, but no effective treatment has been developed. This study showed that rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) can improve the cognitive impairments of STZ-diabetic mice by repairing damaged neurons and astrocytes. The Morris water maze test demonstrated that cognitive impairments induced by diabetes were significantly improved by intravenous injection of BM-MSCs. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, degeneration of neurons and astrocytes, as well as synaptic loss, were prominent in diabetes, and BM-MSC treatment successfully normalized them. Since a limited number of donor BM-MSCs was observed in the brain parenchyma, we hypothesized that humoral factors, especially exosomes released from BM-MSCs, act on damaged neurons and astrocytes. To investigate the effectiveness of exosomes for treatment of diabetes-induced cognitive impairment, exosomes were purified from the culture media and injected intracerebroventricularly into diabetic mice. Recovery of cognitive impairment and histological abnormalities similar to that seen with BM-MSC injection was found following exosome treatment. Use of fluorescence-labeled exosomes demonstrated that injected exosomes were internalized into astrocytes and neurons; these subsequently reversed the dysfunction. The present results indicate that exosomes derived from BM-MSCs might be a promising therapeutic tool for diabetes-induced cognitive impairment.	PMC4840335

Biochim Biophys Acta	2016	Numerous studies are revealing a role of exosomes in intercellular communication, and growing evidence indicates an important function for these vesicles in the progression and pathogenesis of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the biogenesis process of exosomes is still unclear. Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is a multifunctional enzyme with different subcellular localizations. Particularly, under stressful conditions, the enzyme has been also detected in the extracellular matrix, but the mechanism(s) by which TG2 is released outside the cells requires further investigation. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to determine whether exosomes might be a vehicle for TG2 to reach the extracellular space, and whether TG2 could be involved in exosomes biogenesis. To address this issue, we isolated and characterized exosomes derived from cells either expressing or not TG2, under stressful conditions (i.e. proteasome impairment or expressing a mutated form of huntingtin (mHtt) containing 84 polyglutamine repeats). Our results show that TG2 is present in the exosomes only upon proteasome blockade, a condition in which TG2 interacts with TSG101 and ALIX, two key proteins involved in exosome biogenesis. Interestingly, we found that TG2 favours the assembly of a protein complex including mHtt, ALIX, TSG101 and BAG3, a co-chaperone involved in the clearance of mHtt. The formation of this complex is paralleled by the selective recruitment of mHtt and BAG3 in the exosomes derived from TG2 proficient cells only. Overall, our data indicate that TG2 is an important player in the biogenesis of exosomes controlling the selectivity of their cargo under stressful cellular conditions. In addition, these vesicles represent the way by which cells can release TG2 into the extracellular space under proteostasis impairment.

Vet Res	2016	PRRSV is the etiological agent of one of the most important swine diseases with a significant economic burden worldwide and limitations in vaccinology. Exosomes are 30-100 nm vesicles of endocytic origin. Remarkably, immunizations with exosomes containing antigens from tumors or pathogens are capable of eliciting protective immune responses, albeit variably, in cancer and infectious diseases. Here we describe the isolation, molecular composition and immunogenicity of serum-derived exosomes from naïve animals, from PRRSV viremic animals and from animals previously PRRSV infected but already free of viruses (non viremic). Exosomes were isolated through size exclusion chromatography and characterized by different methodologies. Exosome-enriched fractions from naïve and natural infected animals contained classical tetraspanin exosomal markers (CD63 and CD81) and high concentrations of particles in the size-range of exosomes as detected by nanoparticle tracking analysis and cryo-TEM. NanoLC-MS/MS was used to identify viral antigens associated to exosomes. PRRSV-proteins were detected in serum samples from only viremic animals and from animals previously infected already free of viruses (non-viremic), but not in controls. Moreover, immune sera from pigs previously exposed to PRRSV specifically reacted against exosomes purified from non-viremic pig sera in a dose-dependent manner, a reactivity not detected when naïve sera was used in the assay. To facilitate future studies, a scaling-up process was implemented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular characterization of serum-derived exosomes from naïve pigs and pigs actively or previously infected with PRRSV. The presence of antigenic viral proteins in serum-derived exosomes free of virus, suggest their use as a novel vaccine approach against PRRSV.	PMC4888503

J Extracell Vesicles	2016	Exosomes are small, 40-130 nm secreted extracellular vesicles that recently have become the subject of intense focus as agents of intercellular communication, disease biomarkers and potential vehicles for drug delivery. It is currently unknown whether a cell produces different populations of exosomes with distinct cargo and separable functions. To address this question, high-resolution methods are needed. Using a commercial flow cytometer and directly labelled fluorescent antibodies, we show the feasibility of using fluorescence-activated vesicle sorting (FAVS) to analyse and sort individual exosomes isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation from the conditioned medium of DiFi cells, a human colorectal cancer cell line. EGFR and the exosomal marker, CD9, were detected on individual DiFi exosomes by FAVS; moreover, both markers were identified by high-resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy on individual, approximately 100 nm vesicles from flow-sorted EGFR/CD9 double-positive exosomes. We present evidence that the activation state of EGFR can be assessed in DiFi-derived exosomes using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes "conformationally active" EGFR (mAb 806). Using human antigen-specific antibodies, FAVS was able to detect human EGFR and CD9 on exosomes isolated from the plasma of athymic nude mice bearing DiFi tumour xenografts. Multicolour FAVS was used to simultaneously identify CD9, EGFR and an EGFR ligand, amphiregulin (AREG), on human plasma-derived exosomes from 3 normal individuals. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of FAVS to both analyse and sort individual exosomes based on specific cell-surface markers. We propose that FAVS may be a useful tool to monitor EGFR and AREG in circulating exosomes from individuals with colorectal cancer and possibly other solid tumours.	PMC4921784

Pancreatic Cancer Cell Exosome-Mediated Macrophage Reprogramming and the Role of MicroRNAs 155 and 125b2 Transfection using Nanoparticle Delivery Systems.	Sci Rep	2016	Exosomes are nano-sized endosome-derived small intraluminal vesicles, which are important facilitators of intercellular communication by transporting contents, such as protein, mRNA, and microRNAs, between neighboring cells, such as in the tumor microenvironment. The purpose of this study was to understand the mechanisms of exosomes-mediated cellular communication between human pancreatic cancer (Panc-1) cells and macrophages (J771.A1) using a Transwell co-culture system. Following characterization of exosome-mediated cellular communication and pro-tumoral baseline M2 macrophage polarization, the Panc-1 cells were transfected with microRNA-155 (miR-155) and microRNA-125b-2 (miR-125b2) expressing plasmid DNA using hyaluronic acid-poly(ethylene imine)/hyaluronic acid-poly(ethylene glycol) (HA-PEI/HA-PEG) self-assembling nanoparticle-based non-viral vectors. Our results show that upon successful transfection of Panc-1 cells, the exosome content was altered leading to differential communication and reprogramming of the J774.A1 cells to an M1 phenotype. Based on these results, genetic therapies targeted towards selective manipulation of tumor cell-derived exosome content may be very promising for cancer therapy.	PMC4957091

Exosomes derived from mature dendritic cells increase endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis via membrane TNF-α mediated NF-κB pathway.	J Cell Mol Med	2016	Whether dendritic cell (DC) derived exosomes play a role in the progression of endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis remains unclear. Using a transwell system and exosome release inhibitor GW4869, we demonstrated that mature DCs contributed to endothelial inflammation and exosomes were involved in the process. To further confirm this finding, we isolated exosomes from bone marrow dendritic cell (BMDC) culture medium (named DC-exos) and stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) with these DC-exos. We observed that mature DC-exos increased HUVEC inflammation through NF-κB pathway in a manner similar to that of lipopolysaccharide. After a protein array analysis of exosomes, we identified and confirmed tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α on exosome membrane being the trigger of NF-κB pathway in HUVECs. We then performed an in vivo study and found that the aorta endothelial of mice could uptake intravenously injected exosomes and was activated by these exosomes. After a period of 12 weeks of mature DC-exos injection into ApoE-/- mice, the atherosclerotic lesions significantly increased. Our study demonstrates that mature DCs derived exosomes increase endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis via membrane TNF-α mediated NF-κB pathway. This finding extends our knowledge on how DCs affect inflammation and provides a potential method to prevent endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis.	PMC5134386

Breast Cancer Res	2016	BACKGROUND: microRNAs are promising candidate breast cancer biomarkers due to their cancer-specific expression profiles. However, efforts to develop circulating breast cancer biomarkers are challenged by the heterogeneity of microRNAs in the blood. To overcome this challenge, we aimed to develop a molecular profile of microRNAs specifically secreted from breast cancer cells. Our first step towards this direction relates to capturing and analyzing the contents of exosomes, which are small secretory vesicles that selectively encapsulate microRNAs indicative of their cell of origin. To our knowledge, circulating exosome microRNAs have not been well-evaluated as biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis or monitoring. METHODS: Exosomes were collected from the conditioned media of human breast cancer cell lines, mouse plasma of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models (PDX), and human plasma samples. Exosomes were verified by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blot. Cellular and exosome microRNAs from breast cancer cell lines were profiled by next-generation small RNA sequencing. Plasma exosome microRNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Small RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis showed that several microRNAs are selectively encapsulated or highly enriched in breast cancer exosomes. Importantly, the selectively enriched exosome microRNA, human miR-1246, was detected at significantly higher levels in exosomes isolated from PDX mouse plasma, indicating that tumor exosome microRNAs are released into the circulation and can serve as plasma biomarkers for breast cancer. This observation was extended to human plasma samples where miR-1246 and miR-21 were detected at significantly higher levels in the plasma exosomes of 16 patients with breast cancer as compared to the plasma exosomes of healthy control subjects. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the combination of plasma exosome miR-1246 and miR-21 is a better indicator of breast cancer than their individual levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that certain microRNA species, such as miR-21 and miR-1246, are selectively enriched in human breast cancer exosomes and significantly elevated in the plasma of patients with breast cancer. These findings indicate a potential new strategy to selectively analyze plasma breast cancer microRNAs indicative of the presence of breast cancer.	PMC5016889

J Extracell Vesicles	2016	BACKGROUND: Understanding the pathogenic role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in disease and their potential diagnostic and therapeutic utility is extremely reliant on in-depth quantification, measurement and identification of EV sub-populations. Quantification of EVs has presented several challenges, predominantly due to the small size of vesicles such as exosomes and the availability of various technologies to measure nanosized particles, each technology having its own limitations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A standardized methodology to measure the concentration of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been developed and tested. The method is based on measuring the EV concentration as a function of a defined size range. Blood plasma EVs are isolated and purified using size exclusion columns (qEV) and consecutively measured with tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS). Six independent research groups measured liposome and EV samples with the aim to evaluate the developed methodology. Each group measured identical samples using up to 5 nanopores with 3 repeat measurements per pore. Descriptive statistics and unsupervised multivariate data analysis with principal component analysis (PCA) were used to evaluate reproducibility across the groups and to explore and visualise possible patterns and outliers in EV and liposome data sets. RESULTS: PCA revealed good reproducibility within and between laboratories, with few minor outlying samples. Measured mean liposome (not filtered with qEV) and EV (filtered with qEV) concentrations had coefficients of variance of 23.9% and 52.5%, respectively. The increased variance of the EV concentration measurements could be attributed to the use of qEVs and the polydisperse nature of EVs. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of this standardized methodology to facilitate comparable and reproducible EV concentration measurements.	PMC5040823

Isolation and Characterization of Exosomes from Cultures of Tissue Explants and Cell Lines.	Curr Protoc Immunol	2016	Exosomes are specialized, nanometer-sized extracellular vesicles of endosomal origin actively secreted into the extracellular space by a variety of cells under normal and pathological conditions. Exosomes have recently emerged as important intercellular communicators and modulators of diverse mechanisms and cellular responses. Characterization of their composition and function will open possibilities for new diagnostic methods and promising therapeutic approaches based on nanobiology. This unit provides a standard isolation procedure for purification of exosomes based on density gradient ultracentrifugation with sucrose. The process of isolating exosomes relies on obtaining proper source fluids/supernatants as well as qualitative and quantitative assessment of the isolated vesicles. The methodological procedures here can be divided in three parts: (1) pre-isolation procedures aiming to obtain fluids containing exosomes, with a focus on protocols for organ explants and cell cultures; (2) a procedure for exosome isolation with several gradient alternatives; and (3) post-isolation procedures for estimating the purity and yield of the exosomal fraction. © 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Electronic address: .	alnedaw@mcmaster.ca		Nuclear transportation of exogenous epidermal growth factor receptor and androgen receptor via extracellular vesicles.	Eur J Cancer	2017	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a central role in the progression of several human malignancies. Although EGFR is a membrane receptor, it undergoes nuclear translocation, where it has a distinct signalling pathway. Herein, we report a novel mechanism by which cancer cells can directly transport EGFR to the nucleus of other cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs). The transported receptor is active and stimulates the nuclear EGFR pathways. Interestingly, the translocation of EGFR via EVs occurs independently of the nuclear localisation sequence that is required for nuclear translocation of endogenous EGFR. Also, we found that the mutant receptor EGFRvIII could be transported to the nucleus of other cells via EVs. To assess the role of EVs in the regulation of an actual nuclear receptor, we studied the regulation of androgen receptor (AR). We found that full-length AR and mutant variant ARv7 are secreted in EVs derived from prostate cancer cell lines and could be transported to the nucleus of AR-null cells. The EV-derived AR was able to bind the androgen-responsive promoter region of prostate specific antigen, and recruit RNA Pol II, an indication of active transcription. The nuclear-translocated AR via EVs enhanced the proliferation of acceptor cells in the absence of androgen. Finally, we provide evidence that nuclear localisation of AR could occur in vivo via orthotopically-injected EVs in male SCID mice prostate glands. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the nuclear translocation of nuclear receptors via EVs, which significantly extends the role of EVs as paracrine transcriptional regulators.

Cancers (Basel)	2016	Urine extracellular vesicles are a valuable low-invasive source of information, especially for the cells of the genitourinary tract. In the search for biomarkers, different techniques have been developed to isolate and characterize the cargo of these vesicles. In the present work, we compare five of these different isolation methods (three commercial isolation kits, ultracentrifugation, and lectin-based purification) and perform miRNA profiling using a multiplex miRNA assay. The results showed high correlation through all isolation techniques, and 48 out of 68 miRNAs were detected above the detection limit at least 10 times. The results obtained by multiplex assay were validated through Taqman qPCR. In addition, using this technique combined with a clinically friendly extracellular vesicle (uEV)-enrichment method, we performed the analysis of selected miRNAs in urine from patients affected with bladder cancer, benign prostate hyperplasia, or prostate cancer. Importantly, we found that those miRNAs could be detected in almost 100% of the samples, and no significant differences were observed between groups. Our results support the feasibility of analyzing exosomes-associated miRNAs using a methodology that requires a small volume of urine and is compatible with a clinical environment and high-throughput analysis.

Exosomal miR-142-3p is increased during cardiac allograft rejection and augments vascular permeability through down-regulation of endothelial RAB11FIP2 expression.	Cardiovasc Res	2017	Aims: Exosome-mediated microRNA transfer is a recently discovered mode of cell-to-cell communication, in which microRNAs act as paracrine molecules, exerting their regulatory effects in recipient cells. T cells and endothelial cells are two main players in the mechanism of acute cellular cardiac rejection. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of exosomal microRNAs in the crosstalk between T cells and endothelial cells and its implications for the molecular mechanisms that drive acute cellular rejection in heart transplantation. Methods and results: Exosomes isolated from serum samples of heart transplant patients with and without acute cardiac allograft rejection were profiled and showed enrichment of miR-142-3p, miR-92a-3p, miR-339-3p and miR-21-5p. Treatment of endothelial cells with the respected serum exosomes resulted the increased of miR-142-3p level in endothelial cells. Using T cells isolated from healthy donors and activated with either anti-CD3/CD28 antibody or IL-2/PHA, we could show that miR-142-3p is released from activated cells, is contained in exosomes and can be transferred to human vascular endothelial cells in vitro. Transcriptome analysis of endothelial cells treated with activated T cell supernatant with or without exosomes was used to identify mRNA targets of transferred miR-142-3-p. Overexpression of miR-142-3p in endothelial cells resulted in a significant down-regulation of RAB11FIP2, and interaction of miR-142-3p with its predicted target site was confirmed with a reporter assay. Moreover, treatment of endothelial cells with serum exosomes from heart transplant patients with acute cellular rejection resulted in down-regulation of RAB11FIP2 expression and increase in vascular endothelial permeability. Conclusion: We have identified a novel mechanism whereby miR-142-3p, a microRNA enriched in exosomes during acute cellular rejection, is transferred to endothelial cells and compromises endothelial barrier function via down-regulation of RAB11FIP2. This study sheds new light on the interaction between host immune system and cardiac allograft endothelium during acute cellular rejection.

Methods Enzymol	2017	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles that are produced by cells and excreted into extracellular space. Contents of exosomes generally include lipid, membrane, and soluble proteins, and various types of coding and noncoding RNAs. Over the past decades, it has become clear that exosomes constitute an important vector for intercellular transport and communication with significant functional relevance. Evaluating exosome contents and their changes are vital for understanding its role in different physiological and pathological processes. Infection by certain pathogens, including viruses as well as intracellular bacteria, fungi, and parasites, has been shown to induce specific content changes in exosomes produced by infected cells. Evidences also indicate that exosomes produced by infected cells may actively participate in host-virus interactions, including immune responses. Studies of exosome content changes involve highly complex experimental and computational procedures, which can become even more complicated in the context of viral infections, due to the production and secretion of multiple virus-derived proteins and particles by infected cells. In this chapter, general and specific considerations relating to studies of exosome content changes induced by virus activities are discussed and illustrated with the detailed protocols previously used to identify protein content changes in Huh-7 cell exosomes induced by transfection with hepatitis B virus replicon plasmids, using SILAC labeling and LS-MS/MS. Hopefully, this would help enable more and further studies along similar lines and enhance the understanding of this new aspect of host-pathogen interactions.

Blood	2017	Exosomes, secreted by several cell types, including cancer cells, can be isolated from the peripheral blood and have been shown to be powerful markers of disease progression in cancer. In this study, we examined the prognostic significance of circulating exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in multiple myeloma (MM). A cohort of 156 patients with newly diagnosed MM, uniformly treated and followed, was studied. Circulating exosomal miRNAs were isolated and used to perform a small RNA sequencing analysis on 10 samples and a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) array on 156 samples. We studied the relationship between miRNA levels and patient outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We identified miRNAs as the most predominant small RNAs present in exosomes isolated from the serum of patients with MM and healthy controls by small RNA sequencing of circulating exosomes. We then analyzed exosomes isolated from serum samples of 156 patients using a qRT-PCR array for 22 miRNAs. Two of these miRNAs, let-7b and miR-18a, were significantly associated with both PFS and OS in the univariate analysis and were still statistically significant after adjusting for the International Staging System and adverse cytogenetics in the multivariate analysis. Our findings support the use of circulating exosomal miRNAs to improve the identification of patients with newly diagnosed MM with poor outcomes. The results require further validation in other independent prospective MM cohorts.	PMC5409448

Electronic address: .	gdwkgwx@fmmu.edu.cn		Loss of exosomal miR-320a from cancer-associated fibroblasts contributes to HCC proliferation and metastasis.	Cancer Lett	2017	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in regulating tumour progression. Therefore, understanding how CAFs communicate with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is crucial for HCC therapy. Recently, exosomes have been considered an important "messenger" between cells. In this study, we performed microRNA (miRNA) sequencing of exosomes derived from CAFs and corresponding para-cancer fibroblasts (PAFs) of HCC patients. We found a significant reduction in the miR-320a level in CAF-derived exosomes. Using exogenous miRNAs, we demonstrated that stromal cells could transfer miRNA to HCC cells. In vitro and in vivo studies further revealed that miR-320a could function as an antitumour miRNA by binding to its direct downstream target PBX3 to suppress HCC cell proliferation, migration and metastasis. The miR-320a-PBX3 pathway inhibited tumour progression by suppressing the activation of the MAPK pathway, which could induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and upregulate cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and MMP2 expression to promote cell proliferation and metastasis. In xenograft experiments involving CAFs mixed with MHCC97-H cells, miR-320a overexpression in CAFs could inhibit tumourigenesis. Therefore, these data suggest that CAF-mediated HCC tumour progression is partially related to the loss of antitumour miR-320a in the exosomes of CAFs and that promoting the transfer of stromal cell-derived miR-320a might be a potential treatment option to overcome HCC progression.

Exosomes Isolated from Ascites of T-Cell Lymphoma-Bearing Mice Expressing Surface CD24 and HSP-90 Induce a Tumor-Specific Immune Response.	Front Immunol	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including endosome-derived nanovesicles (exosomes), are involved in cell-cell communication. Through transfer of their molecular contents, extracellular nanovesicles can alter the function of recipient cells. Due to these characteristics, EVs have shown potential as a new alternative for cancer immunotherapy. Tumor exosomes isolated from malignant ascites can activate dendritic cells, thereby priming the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. However, a suppressive role on tumor immune response has also been reported, suggesting that the neoplastic stage of carcinogenesis and the microenvironment where tumor cells grow may influence the amount of EVs released by the cell. This neoplastic stage and microenvironment may also impact EVs' components such as proteins and miRNA, determining their biological behavior. Most T-cell lymphomas have an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis. Consequently, complementary alternative therapies are needed to improve the survival rates achieved with conventional treatments. In this work, we have characterized EVs isolated from ascites of mice bearing a very aggressive murine T-cell lymphoma and have studied their immunogenic properties. Small EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation, ultrafiltration, and ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g on a sucrose cushion. The EVs were defined as exosomes by their morphology and size analyzed by electron microscopy, their floating density on a sucrose gradient, as well as their expression of endosome marker proteins ALIX, TSG-101; the tetraspanins CD63, CD9, and CD81. In addition, they contain tumor antigens, the marker for malignancy CD24, the heat shock protein HSP-70, and an unusual surface expression of HSP-90 was demonstrated. The administration of EVs isolated from ascites (EVs A) into naïve-syngeneic mice induced both humoral and cellular immune responses that allowed the rejection of subsequent tumor challenges. However, the immunization had no effect on a non-related mammary adenocarcinoma, demonstrating that the immune response elicited was specific and also it induced immune memory. In vitro analysis demonstrated that T-cells from EVs A-immunized mice secrete IFN-γ in response to tumor stimulation. Furthermore, tumor-specific CD4+ and CD8+ IFN-γ secreting cells could be efficiently expanded from mice immunized with EVs A, showing that a T helper 1 response is involved in tumor rejection. Our findings confirm exosomes as promising defined acellular tumor antigens for the development of an antitumor vaccine.	PMC5352668

Exosomal microRNAs isolated from plasma of mesenteric veins linked to liver metastases in resected patients with colon cancer.	Oncotarget	2017	Before reaching a peripheral vein (PV), miRNAs released by the tumor are diluted and dispersed throughout the body or even retained in a specific organ. We hypothesized that blood drawn from the tumor-draining vein could provide more homogeneous information than blood drawn from the PV as that blood would contain all the biomarkers released by the tumor before they reach a potential metastatic site. We have profiled 754 miRNAs in 15 colon cancer plasma samples from the tumor-draining vein, the mesenteric vein (MV), identifying 13 microRNAs associated with relapse. The prognostic impact of these miRNAs were validated in 50 MV and 50 paired PV plasma samples of stage I-III colon cancer patients. Four miRNAs, let-7g, miR-15b, miR-155 and miR-328, were found overexpressed in MV compared to PV, and patients with high levels of those miRNAs in MV plasma had shorter time to relapse. Interestingly, in patients developing liver metastases, the exosomal cargo of miR-328 was much greater in MV than in PV plasma indicating a possible role of miR-328 in the development of liver metastases. Our results indicate that in colon cancer, the primary tumor releases high concentrations of miRNAs through the MV, and some of them are contained in tumor derived exosomes.	PMC5458173

J Biol Chem	2017	Transglutaminases (TGs) play essential intracellular and extracellular roles by covalently cross-linking many proteins. Drosophila TG is encoded by one gene and has two alternative splicing-derived isoforms, TG-A and TG-B, which contain distinct N-terminal 46- and 38-amino acid sequences, respectively. The TGs identified to date do not have a typical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-signal peptide, and the molecular mechanisms of their secretion under physiologic conditions are unclear. Immunocytochemistry revealed that TG-A localizes to multivesicular-like structures, whereas TG-B localizes to the cytosol. We also found that TG-A, but not TG-B, was modified concomitantly by N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation, and N-myristoylation was a pre-requisite for S-palmitoylation. Moreover, TG-A, but not TG-B, was secreted in response to calcium signaling induced by Ca2+ ionophores and uracil, a pathogenic bacteria-derived substance. Brefeldin A and monensin, inhibitors of the ER/Golgi-mediated conventional pathway, did not suppress TG-A secretion, whereas inhibition of S-palmitoylation by 2-bromopalmitate blocked TG-A secretion. Ultracentrifugation, electron microscopy analyses, and treatments with inhibitors of multivesicular body formation revealed that TG-A was secreted via exosomes together with co-transfected mammalian CD63, an exosomal marker, and the secreted TG-A was taken up by other cells. The 8-residue N-terminal fragment of TG-A containing the fatty acylation sites was both necessary and sufficient for the exosome-dependent secretion of TG-A. In conclusion, TG-A is secreted through an unconventional ER/Golgi-independent pathway involving two types of fatty acylations and exosomes.	PMC5481576

Pulmonary microRNA profiling: implications in upper lobe predominant lung disease.	Clin Epigenetics	2017	BACKGROUND: Numerous pulmonary diseases manifest with upper lobe predominance including cystic fibrosis, smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and tuberculosis. Zonal hypoxia, characteristic of these pulmonary maladies, and oxygen stress in general is known to exert profound effects on various important aspects of cell biology. Lung macrophages are major participants in the pulmonary innate immune response and regional differences in macrophage responsiveness to hypoxia may contribute in the development of lung disease. MicroRNAs are ubiquitous regulators of human biology and emerging evidence indicates altered microRNA expression modulates respiratory disease processes. The objective of this study is to gain insight into the epigenetic and cellular mechanisms influencing regional differences in lung disease by investigating effect of hypoxia on regional microRNA expression in the lung. All studies were performed using primary alveolar macrophages (n = 10) or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (n = 16) isolated from human subjects. MicroRNA was assayed via the NanoString nCounter microRNA assay. RESULTS: Divergent molecular patterns of microRNA expression were observed in alternate lung lobes, specifically noted was disparate expression of miR-93 and miR-4454 in alveolar macrophages along with altered expression of miR-451a and miR-663a in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Gene ontology was used to identify potential downstream targets of divergent microRNAs. Targets include cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, molecules that could have a significant impact on pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show variant regional microRNA expression associated with hypoxia in alveolar macrophages and BAL fluid in the lung-upper vs lower lobe. Future studies should address whether these specific microRNAs may act intracellularly, in a paracrine/endocrine manner to direct the innate immune response or may ultimately be involved in pulmonary host-to-pathogen trans-kingdom cross-talk.

Mediators Inflamm	2017	The purpose of this study is to characterize synovial fluid- (SF-) derived exosomes of patients with gonarthrosis comparing two methods of isolation and to investigate their immune regulatory properties. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been isolated from inflamed SF by polymer precipitation method and quantified by Exocet kit and by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Vesicles expressed all the specific exosomal markers by immunoblot and FACS. After isolation with Exoquick, a relevant contamination by immune complexes was detected, which required further magnetic bead-based purification to remove. SF-derived exosomes significantly stimulated the release of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and metalloproteinases by M1 macrophages but did not influence the expression of CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules. In conclusion, we characterized purified exosomes isolated from inflamed SF and demonstrate that purified exosomes are functionally active in their ability to stimulate the release of proinflammatory factors from M1 macrophages. Our data indicate that SF-derived exosomes from gonarthrosis patients play a role in disease progression.	PMC5467328

Exosomes are nano-sized intraluminal multi-vesicular bodies secreted by most types of cells and have been found to mediate intercellular communication through the transfer of genetic information via coding and non-coding RNAs to recipient cells. Since exosomes are considered as protective and enriched sources of shuttle microRNAs (miRNAs), we hypothesized that exosomal transfer of miRNAs from MSCs may affect tumor cell behavior, particularly angiogenesis. METHODS: Exosomes derived from MSCs were isolated and characterized by scanning electron microscopy analyses, dynamic light scattering measurements, and Western blotting. Fold changes in miR-100 expression levels were calculated in exosomes and their corresponding donor cells by qRT-PCR. The effects of exosomal transfer of miR-100 from MSCs were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting of the mTOR/HIF-1α/VEGF signaling axis in breast cancer cells. The quantification of secreted VEGF protein was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The putative paracrine effects of MSC-derived exosomes on tumor angiogenesis were explored by in vitro angiogenesis assays including endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation assays. RESULTS: We found that MSC-derived exosomes induce a significant and dose-dependent decrease in the expression and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through modulating the mTOR/HIF-1α signaling axis in breast cancer-derived cells. We also found that miR-100 is enriched in MSC-derived exosomes and that its transfer to breast cancer-derived cells is associated with the down-regulation of VEGF in a time-dependent manner. The putative role of exosomal miR-100 transfer in regulating VEGF expression was substantiated by the ability of anti-miR-100 to rescue the inhibitory effects of MSC-derived exosomes on the expression of VEGF in breast cancer-derived cells. In addition, we found that down-regulation of VEGF mediated by MSC-derived exosomes can affect the vascular behavior of endothelial cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that exosomal transfer of miR-100 may be a novel mechanism underlying the paracrine effects of MSC-derived exosomes and may provide a means by which these vesicles can modulate vascular responses within the microenvironment of breast cancer cells.

Obes Surg	2018	BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery markedly reduces fat mass with beneficial effects on cardiometabolic health but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by a variety of cells, including adipocytes, and may mediate some of these benefits. However, the effects of bariatric surgery on circulating EVs are unclear. METHODS: Concentration of plasma EVs isolated by ultracentrifugation at baseline, 1 and 6 months post-bariatric surgery (n = 20) was established using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. EV origin (CD9: exosome; CD41: platelet; CD235a: erythrocyte; CD11b: leukocyte; CD144: endothelial), cytokine (interferon γ, interleukin-6, TNF-α) and adipocyte marker (adiponectin, FABP4, PPARγ) expression was measured by time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay. RESULTS: EV concentration and cell-of-origin markers (CD41, CD235a, CD11b, CD144) did not alter in response to surgery, neither did EV-expressed interferon γ, IL-6, TNF-α, adiponectin, PPARγ or CD9. EV-derived fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) increased at 1 month (+ 49%) before returning to baseline by 6 months (- 51%, p < 0.05), corresponding to similar changes in circulating plasma FABP4 (+ 22 and - 24% at 1 and 6 months, respectively; p < 0.001). Patients who underwent biliopancreatic diversion had lower FABP4-expressing EVs at 6 months compared to those who underwent sleeve gastrectomy/gastric banding (p < 0.05), despite similar percentage weight reduction (- 19 vs - 20%, respectively). CD9 expression correlated with EV-expressed FABP4, adiponectin, TNF-α and interferon γ (r = 0.5, r = 0.59, r = 0.53, r = 0.41, respectively, p < 0.005), suggesting transport by an EV population of exosomal rather than microvesicular origin. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery leads to a transient change in circulating EV- and plasma-derived FABP4, reflecting alterations in adipose tissue homeostasis.

Cancer Res	2017	Tumor-stromal communications impact tumorigenesis in ways that are incompletely understood. Here, we show that glioma-associated human mesenchymal stem cells (GA-hMSC), a newly identified stromal component of glioblastoma, release exosomes that increase the proliferation and clonogenicity of tumor-initiating glioma stem-like cells (GSC). This event leads to a significantly greater tumor burden and decreased host survival compared with untreated GSCs in orthotopic xenografts. Analysis of the exosomal content identified miR-1587 as a mediator of the exosomal effects on GSCs, in part via downregulation of the tumor-suppressive nuclear receptor corepressor NCOR1. Our results illuminate the tumor-supporting role for GA-hMSCs by identifying GA-hMSC-derived exosomes in the intercellular transfer of specific miRNA that enhance the aggressiveness of glioblastoma.

Exosomes containing miR-21 transfer the characteristic of cisplatin resistance by targeting PTEN and PDCD4 in oral squamous cell carcinoma.	Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)	2017	Resistance to chemotherapy remains a major obstacle for the effective treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Evidence for the involvement of exosomes as important regulators of cisplatin chemoresistance in OSCC is still poorly understood. Our objective of this study was to explore the roles for exosomes in modulating key cellular pathways mediating response to chemotherapy. We first developed the cisplatin-resistant cell lines (HSC-3-R and SCC-9-R) and found that the conditioned media from cisplatin-resistant OSCC cells enhanced the chemoresistance of parental OSCC cell. The release of exosomes was blocked by inhibitor (GW4869) and exosomes were found to be involved in the chemoresistance of parental OSCC cell transferred from resistant cells. The exosomes derived from resistant cells and parental cells were isolated. Then, the isolated exosomes were characterized and quantified by electron microscopy, qNano analysis, and western blot analysis. Exosomes derived from cisplatin-resistant OSCC cells were found to enhance the chemoresistance of OSCC cell and decrease the DNA damage signaling in response to cisplatin. It was also found that exosomes derived from cisplatin-resistant OSCC cells transferred miR-21 to OSCC parental cells and induced cisplatin resistance by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog and programmed cell death 4. Furthermore, the roles of cisplatin-resistant OSCC cells-derived exosomes in vivo were confirmed by subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. Collectively, the results suggest that exosomes released from cisplatin-resistant OSCC cells transmit miR-21 to induce cisplatin resistance of OSCC cells.

Neoplasia	2017	Treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma with kinase inhibitors has been associated with rapid tumor regression; however, this clinical benefit is short-lived, and most patients relapse. A number of studies suggest that the extracellular environment promotes BRAF inhibitor resistance and tumor progression. Extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, are functional mediators in the extracellular environment. They are small vesicles known to carry a concentrated group of functional cargo and serve as intercellular communicators not only locally but also systemically. Increasingly, it is reported that extracellular vesicles facilitate the development of drug resistance in cancer; however, their role in BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma is unclear. Here we investigated if extracellular vesicles from BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma could influence drug sensitivity in recipient melanoma cells. We demonstrate that the resistance driver, PDGFRβ, can be transferred to recipient melanoma cells via extracellular vesicles, resulting in a dose-dependent activation of PI3K/AKT signaling and escape from MAPK pathway BRAF inhibition. These data suggest that the BRAF inhibitor-sensitive phenotype of metastatic melanoma can be altered by delivery of PDGFRβ by extracellular vesicles derived from neighboring drug-resistant melanoma cells.

Placental Nano-vesicles Target to Specific Organs and Modulate Vascular Tone In Vivo.	Hum Reprod	2017	STUDY QUESTION: How do nano-vesicles extruded from normal first trimester human placentae affect maternal vascular function? SUMMARY ANSWER: Placental nano-vesicles affect the ability of systemic mesenteric arteries to undergo endothelium- and nitric oxide- (NO-) dependent vasodilation in vivo in pregnant mice. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Dramatic cardiovascular adaptations occur during human pregnancy, including a substantial decrease in total peripheral resistance in the first trimester. The human placenta constantly extrudes extracellular vesicles that can enter the maternal circulation and these vesicles may play an important role in feto-maternal communication. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Human placental nano-vesicles were administered into CD1 mice via a tail vein and their localization and vascular effects at 30 min and 24 h post-injection were investigated. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Nano-vesicles from normal first trimester human placentae were collected and administered into pregnant (D12.5) or non-pregnant female mice. After either 30 min or 24 h of exposure, all major organs were dissected for imaging (n = 7 at each time point) while uterine and mesenteric arteries were dissected for wire myography (n = 6 at each time point). Additional in vitro studies using HMEC-1 endothelial cells were also conducted to investigate the kinetics of interaction between placental nano-vesicles and endothelial cells. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Nano-vesicles from first trimester human placentae localized to the lungs, liver and kidneys 24 h after injection into pregnant mice (n = 7). Exposure of pregnant mice to placental nano-vesicles for 30 min in vivo increased the vasodilatory response of mesenteric arteries to acetylcholine, while exposure for 24 h had the opposite effect (P < 0.05, n = 6). These responses were prevented by L-NAME, an NO synthase inhibitor. Placental nano-vesicles did not affect the function of uterine arteries or mesenteric arteries from non-pregnant mice. Placental nano-vesicles rapidly interacted with endothelial cells via a combination of phagocytosis, endocytosis and cell surface binding in vitro. LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: As it is not ethical to administer labelled placental nano-vesicles to pregnant women, pregnant CD1 mice were used as a model of pregnancy. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first study to report the localization of placental nano-vesicles and their vascular effects in vivo. This work provides new insight into how the dramatic maternal cardiovascular adaptations to pregnancy may occur and indicates that placental extracellular vesicles may be important mediators of feto-maternal communication in a healthy pregnancy.

Nat Commun	2017	Metastatic cancers produce exosomes that condition pre-metastatic niches in remote microenvironments to favor metastasis. In contrast, here we show that exosomes from poorly metastatic melanoma cells can potently inhibit metastasis to the lung. These "non-metastatic" exosomes stimulate an innate immune response through the expansion of Ly6Clow patrolling monocytes (PMo) in the bone marrow, which then cause cancer cell clearance at the pre-metastatic niche, via the recruitment of NK cells and TRAIL-dependent killing of melanoma cells by macrophages. These events require the induction of the Nr4a1 transcription factor and are dependent on pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) on the outer surface of exosomes. Importantly, exosomes isolated from patients with non-metastatic primary melanomas have a similar ability to suppress lung metastasis. This study thus demonstrates that pre-metastatic tumors produce exosomes, which elicit a broad range of PMo-reliant innate immune responses via trigger(s) of immune surveillance, causing cancer cell clearance at the pre-metastatic niche.

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2018	Seminal plasma (SP) is considered as a vehicle to carry sperm into female reproductive tract, of which functions have not been completely understood. This study aimed to identify the function of seminal exosomes on porcine endometrium. Exosomes were isolated from the sperm-rich fraction of boar semen and were confirmed by the expression of exosome marker HSP70 and size distribution using nano-sight tracking analysis. Porcine endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) were then treated with seminal exosomes, and RNA extracted were subjected to global expression analysis. Transcripts related to "immune response", "inflammatory response" and their associated signaling pathways were up-regulated in EECs treated with seminal exosome, whereas those associated with "steroid biosynthesis", "metabolic pathways" and "T cell differentiation" were down-regulated. The decrease in PMVK, SC5D, INSIG1, HSD17B7, NSDHL, HMGCR, SQLE and FDFT1, and increase in CCL20, TNFSF15, AMCFII, CXCL2 and CXCL8 were also found in the endometrium from the naturally mated pigs. Moreover, changes in exosome-induced CYP24A1, EBP, CCL20, AMCFII and IL1A expression were not regulated by the exosome removed SP. These observations indicated that exosomes present in SP are involved in the immune-related gene regulation in the uterus, which could pave the passage for sperm and possibly fertilized eggs.

Autophagy inhibition promotes SNCA/alpha-synuclein release and transfer via extracellular vesicles with a hybrid autophagosome-exosome-like phenotype.	Autophagy	2018	The autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) regulates intracellular homeostasis of the cytosolic protein SNCA/alpha-synuclein and is impaired in synucleinopathies, including Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Emerging evidence suggests that ALP influences SNCA release, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are not well understood. Several studies identified SNCA in exosome/extracellular vesicle (EV) fractions. EVs are generated in the multivesicular body compartment and either released upon its fusion with the plasma membrane, or cleared via the ALP. We therefore hypothesized that inhibiting ALP clearance 1) enhances SNCA release via EVs by increasing extracellular shuttling of multivesicular body contents, 2) alters EV biochemical profile, and 3) promotes SNCA cell-to-cell transfer. Indeed, ALP inhibition increased the ratio of extra- to intracellular SNCA and upregulated SNCA association with EVs in neuronal cells. Ultrastructural analysis revealed a widespread, fused multivesicular body-autophagosome compartment. Biochemical characterization revealed the presence of autophagosome-related proteins, such as LC3-II and SQSTM1. This distinct "autophagosome-exosome-like" profile was also identified in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) EVs. After a single intracortical injection of SNCA-containing EVs derived from CSF into mice, human SNCA colocalized with endosome and neuronal markers. Prominent SNCA immunoreactivity and a higher number of neuronal SNCA inclusions were observed after DLB patient CSF EV injections. In summary, this study provides compelling evidence that a) ALP inhibition increases SNCA in neuronal EVs, b) distinct ALP components are present in EVs, and c) CSF EVs transfer SNCA from cell to cell in vivo. Thus, macroautophagy/autophagy may regulate EV protein composition and consequently progression in synucleinopathies.	PMC5846507

Exp Cell Res	2018	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are both potent immune-modulators. The aberrant proliferation and function of Tregs plays an important role in the development of asthma. Our previous studies have demonstrated the role of MSCs in promoting proliferation and immune-modulating of Tregs, as well as alleviating airway inflammation of asthmatic mice. In the present study, we isolated exosomes secreted by MSCs and investigated their immunomodulation effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of asthmatic patient. We found that MSC exosomes upregulated IL-10 and TGF-β1 from PBMCs, thus promoting proliferation and immune-suppression capacity of Tregs. Furthermore, antigen presenting cells (APCs) but not CD4+ T cells-dependent pathway was shown to be possible mechanism involved in MSC exosome-mediated regulation. Our data elucidated the key role of exosomes in immune-modulation of MSCs, and suggested the therapeutic potential of MSC exosomes for asthma.

J Transl Med	2018	BACKGROUND: Plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially exosome-like vesicles (ELVs), are being increasingly explored as a source of potential noninvasive disease biomarkers. The discovery of blood-based biomarkers associated with ELVs requires methods that isolate high yields of these EVs without significant contamination with highly abundant plasma proteins and lipoproteins. The rising interest in blood-based EV-associated biomarkers has led to the rapid development of novel EV isolation methods. However, the field suffers from a lack of standardization and often, new techniques are used without critical evaluation. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) has become the method of choice for rapid isolation of relatively pure EVs from plasma, yet it has technical limitations for certain downstream applications. The recently released exoEasy kit (Qiagen) is a new membrane affinity spin column method for the isolation of highly pure EVs from biofluids with the potential to overcome most of the limitations of SEC. METHODS: By using multiple complementary techniques we assessed the performance of the exoEasy kit in isolating ELVs from 2 ml of human plasma and compared it with the SEC qEV column (Izon Science). RESULTS: Our data show that exoEasy kit isolates a heterogenous mixture of particles with a larger median diameter, broader size range and a higher yield than the SEC qEV column. The exclusive presence of small RNAs in the particles and the total RNA yield were comparable to the SEC qEV column. Despite being less prone to low density lipoprotein contamination than the SEC qEV column, the overall purity of exoEasy kit EV preparations was suboptimal. The low particle-protein ratio, significant amount of albumin, very low levels of exosome-associated proteins and propensity to triglyceride-rich lipoprotein contamination suggest isolation of mainly non-ELVs and co-isolation of plasma proteins and certain lipoproteins by the exoEasy kit. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that performance of exoEasy kit for the isolation of ELVs for biomarker discovery is inferior to the SEC qEV column. This comprehensive evaluation of a novel EV isolation method contributes to the acceleration of the discovery of EV-associated biomarkers and the development of EV-based diagnostics.	PMC5761138

Lung-Derived Exosomal miR-483-3p Regulates the Innate Immune Response to Influenza Virus Infection.	J Infect Dis	2018	Exosomes regulate cell-cell communication by transferring functional proteins and RNAs between cells. Here, to clarify the function of exosomes during influenza virus infection, we characterized lung-derived exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs). Among the detected miRNAs, miR-483-3p was present at high levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) exosomes during infection of mice with various strains of influenza virus, and miR-483-3p transfection potentiated gene expression of type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine upon viral infection of MLE-12 cells. RNF5, a regulator of the RIG-I signaling pathway, was identified as a target gene of miR-483-3p. Moreover, we found that CD81, another miR-483-3p target, functions as a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling in MLE-12 cells. Taken together, this study indicates that BALF exosomal miRNAs may mediate the antiviral and inflammatory response to influenza virus infection.

Hypoxia increases amyloid-β level in exosomes by enhancing the interaction between CD147 and Hook1.	Am J Transl Res	2018	Hypoxia promotes the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ), which is related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). CD147 is considered as an additional subunit of γ-secretase regulated by hypoxia, and has been identified in exosomes. Aβ is also found in exosomes that participate in the intercellular communication and amyloids propagation. This study was to investigate the role of CD147 in hypoxia-induced accumulation of Aβ in exosomes. Our results showed that hypoxia increased the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in exosomes and enhanced the interaction between CD147 and Hook1 in SH-SY5YAPP695 cells. Moreover, hypoxia increased the interaction between amyloid precursor protein (APP) and CD147 as well as the expression of CD147 in isolated membrane. After we interfered the interaction between CD147 and Hook1 by decreasing Rab22a expression, the hypoxia induced Aβ accumulation in exosomes was significantly suppressed. In addition, the increased interaction between CD147 and Hook1 was further confirmed in hypoxia exposed C57BL/6 mice. Our findings reveal that hypoxia may increase exosome Aβ level by enhancing the interaction between CD147 and Hook1.	PMC5801354

The involvement of serum exosomal miR-500-3p and miR-770-3p in aging: modulation by calorie restriction.	Oncotarget	2018	Recent studies have shown a role for miRNAs in aging and age-related diseases, and the modulation of miRNA expression by diet attracts attention as a new therapeutic strategy. Here, we focused on identifying specific exosomal miRNAs derived from serum of aged rats and the effect of short-term calorie restriction (CR) on their expression. Exosomes from serum of young (7-month), old (22-month), and old-CR Sprague Dawley rats were isolated and characterized by transmission electron microscopy analyses, dynamic light scattering measurements, and Western blotting. A total of 12 significantly expressed miRNAs in serum exosomes of young and old rats were identified by next generation sequencing. After analysis of qRT-PCR, we found that miR-500-3p and miR-770-3p expression was significantly upregulated by aging and downregulated by CR. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the selected miRNAs represented high accuracy in discriminating old rats from young rats. Finally, PANTHER analysis predicted selected miRNAs targets genes involved in Wnt/chemokines and cytokines -related inflammatory signaling pathway and function as transcription factor. In conclusion, our results suggest that the expression of serum exosomal miR-500-3p and miR-770-3p was significantly increased with aging, whereas these were decreased by CR, and age-/CR-modulated exosomal miR-500-3p and miR-770-3p could potentially be used as informative biomarkers candidates for aging.

Exosomal microRNA predicts and protects against severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely premature infants.	JCI Insight	2018	Premature infants are at high risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), characterized by chronic inflammation and inhibition of lung development, which we have recently identified as being modulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) and alterations in the airway microbiome. Exosomes and exosomal miRNAs may regulate cell differentiation and tissue and organ development. We discovered that tracheal aspirates from infants with severe BPD had increased numbers of, but smaller, exosomes compared with term controls. Similarly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from hyperoxia-exposed mice (an animal model of BPD) and supernatants from hyperoxia-exposed human bronchial epithelial cells (in vitro model of BPD) had increased exosomes compared with air controls. Next, in a prospective cohort study of tracheal aspirates obtained at birth from extremely preterm infants, utilizing independent discovery and validation cohorts, we identified unbiased exosomal miRNA signatures predictive of severe BPD. The strongest signal of reduced miR-876-3p in BPD-susceptible compared with BPD-resistant infants was confirmed in the animal model and in vitro models of BPD. In addition, based on our recent discovery of increased Proteobacteria in the airway microbiome being associated with BPD, we developed potentially novel in vivo and in vitro models for BPD combining Proteobacterial LPS and hyperoxia exposure. Addition of LPS led to a larger reduction in exosomal miR 876-3p in both hyperoxia and normoxia compared with hyperoxia alone, thus indicating a potential mechanism by which alterations in microbiota can suppress miR 876-3p. Gain of function of miR 876-3p improved the alveolar architecture in the in vivo BPD model, demonstrating a causal link between miR 876-3p and BPD. In summary, we provide evidence for the strong predictive biomarker potential of miR 876-3p in severe BPD. We also provide insights on the pathogenesis of neonatal lung disease, as modulated by hyperoxia and microbial product-induced changes in exosomal miRNA 876-3p, which could be targeted for future therapeutic development.

Exosomes from asbestos-exposed cells modulate gene expression in mesothelial cells.	FASEB J	2018	Asbestos exposure is a determinate cause of many diseases, such as mesothelioma, fibrosis, and lung cancer, and poses a major human health hazard. At this time, there are no identified biomarkers to demarcate asbestos exposure before the presentation of disease and symptoms, and there is only limited understanding of the underlying biology that governs asbestos-induced disease. In our study, we used exosomes, 30-140 nm extracellular vesicles, to gain insight into these knowledge gaps. As inhaled asbestos is first encountered by lung epithelial cells and macrophages, we hypothesize that asbestos-exposed cells secrete exosomes with signature proteomic cargo that can alter the gene expression of mesothelial cells, contributing to disease outcomes like mesothelioma. In the present study using lung epithelial cells (BEAS2B) and macrophages (THP-1), we first show that asbestos exposure causes changes in abundance of some proteins in the exosomes secreted from these cells. Furthermore, exposure of human mesothelial cells (HPM3) to these exosomes resulted in gene expression changes related to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and other cancer-related genes. This is the first report to indicate that asbestos-exposed cells secrete exosomes with differentially abundant proteins and that those exosomes have a gene-altering effect on mesothelial cells.-Munson, P., Lam, Y.-W., Dragon, J.

Tumor-Derived Exosomal Long Noncoding RNAs as Promising Diagnostic Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.	Cell Physiol Biochem	2018	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Exosomal circulating long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in blood are emerging as clinically useful and non-invasive biomarkers for tumor diagnosis. However, normal cells can also secrete exosomes, so it is a prerequisite to obtain tumor-derived exosomes for better understanding of their diagnostic impacts in cancer. In this study, a dual-antibody-functionalized immunoaffinity system was established to isolate exosomes and investigate their lncRNAs expression pattern and clinical significance in prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: A commercially available kit was used to isolate total exosomes, which were then purified by a dual-antibody-functionalized immunoaffinity system. RT-qPCR was performed to detect the expression of exosomal lncRNAs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to assess the diagnostic value. RESULTS: Expression levels of two lncRNAs in tumor-derived exosomes were significantly higher than those in total exosomes. The levels of SAP30L-AS1 were upregulated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and SChLAP1 levels were significantly higher in PCa than in BPH and healthy individuals. The area under the ROC curve indicated that SAP30L-AS1 and SChLAP1 had adequate diagnostic value to distinguish PCa from controls. Two lncRNAs separately combined with prostate specific antigen (PSA) possessed a moderate ability for discrimination. SAP30L-AS1 expression level was related to PSA values and tumor invasion. SChLAP1 expression was significantly higher in patients with higher Gleason scores, and was also effective in differentiating between BPH and PCa when the concentration of PSA was in the gray zone. CONCLUSION: The isolation of tumor-derived exosomes by dual-antibody-functionalized immunoaffinity systems and detection of their lncRNAs in plasma may lead to the identification of suitable biomarkers, with potential diagnostic utility.

Extracellular vesicle-encapsulated miR-30e suppresses cholangiocarcinoma cell invasion and migration via inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.	Oncotarget	2018	Early-staged cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is difficult to diagnose due to its high potential for invasion and metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in a process thought to be important for invasion and metastasis in several cancers, including CCA. Although microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several malignancies, their roles to CCA are not clearly understood. Some miRNAs were reported to be included in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and transferred from their donor cells to other cells, modulating recipient cell behaviors. In this study, the involvement and functional roles of EV-contained miRNAs during EMT in human CCA were determined. Expression profiling identified a subset of miRNAs that were reduced by TGF-β in CCA cells. Among these, miR-30e was highly downregulated by TGF-β and predicted to target Snail, which is an EMT-inducible transcription factor. MiR-30e overexpression suppressed cell invasion and migration via inhibiting EMT, whereas miR-30e inhibition promoted EMT, cell invasion and migration. Moreover, miR-30e was enriched in EVs derived from CCA cells after miR-30e overexpression, and miR-30e intercellular transfer through EVs suppressed EMT, cell invasion and migration in recipient CCA cells. Together, our results suggest that EV-mediated miR-30e transfer could inhibit EMT via directly targeting Snail, which subsequently suppresses CCA cell invasion and migration. These findings provide several new insights into regulatory mechanisms of tumor invasion and metastasis in human CCA.	PMC5893249

Electronic address: .	tbrinkle@wakehealth.edu		Detection of the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts in neuronally-derived exosomes in plasma.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2018	Exosomes are nanovesicles that participate in cell-to-cell communication and are secreted by a variety of cells including neurons. Recent studies suggest that neuronally-derived exosomes are detectable in plasma and that their contents likely reflect expression of various biomarkers in brain tissues. The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is increased in brain regions affected by AD. The goal of our project was to determine whether RAGE is present in plasma exosomes, and specifically exosomes derived from neurons. Exosomes were isolated from plasma samples (n = 8) by precipitation (ExoQuick) and ultracentrifugation methods. Neuronally-derived exosomes were isolated using a biotin-tagged L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule (L1CAM) specific antibody and streptavidin-tagged agarose resin. RAGE expression was measured by Western blots and ELISA. Western Blotting showed that RAGE is present in L1CAM-positive exosomes isolated using both methods. Mean (SD) exosomal RAGE levels were 164 (60) pg/ml by ExoQuick and were highly correlated with plasma sRAGE levels (r = 0.87, p = 0.005), which were approximately 7.5-fold higher than exosomal levels. Weak to moderate correlations were found between exosomal RAGE and age, BMI, and cognitive function. These results show for the first time that RAGE is present in neuronally-derived plasma exosomes, and suggest that exosomal RAGE may be a novel biomarker that reflects pathophysiological processes in the brain.

Stem Cell Res Ther	2018	BACKGROUND: The subcellular distribution of prorenin receptor and adaptor protein ATP6AP2 may affect neurogenesis. In this study, we hypothesized that ATP6AP2 expression and subcellular relocalization from caveolae/lipid raft microdomains (CLR-Ms) to intracellular sites may correlate with neuronal differentiation (Neu-Dif) of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs). METHODS: Human ADSCs isolated from 24 healthy donors and 24 patients with neurological disorders (ND) were cultured and induced for Neu-Dif. The mechanism of action of ATP6AP2 and the impact of its localization within the plasma membrane (particularly CLR-Ms) and intracellular sites on several pathways (mitogen-activated protein kinase, Wnt(s) signaling and others) and intracellular calcium and exosome release were evaluated. The impact of CLR-Ms on ATP6AP2 or vice versa was determined by pharmacological disruption of CLR-Ms or siATP6AP2 assays. RESULTS: In patients with ND, loss of ATP6AP2 from CLR-Ms correlated with an inhibition of Neu-Dif and signaling. However, its relocalization in CLR-Ms was positively correlated to induction of Neu-Dif in healthy subjects. An apparent switch from canonical to noncanonical Wnt signaling as well as from caveolin to flotillin occurs concurrently with the increases of ATP6AP2 expression during neurogenesis. Stimulation by renin activates ERK/JNK/CREB/c-Jun but failed to induce β-catenin. Wnt5a enhanced the renin-induced JNK responsiveness. Gα proteins crosslink ATP6AP2 to caveolin where a switch from Gαi to Gαq is necessary for Neu-Dif. In ATP6AP2-enriched CLR-Ms, the release of exosomes was induced dependently from the intracellular Ca2+ and Gαq. Pharmacological disruption of CLR-M formation/stability impairs both ATP6AP2 localization and Neu-Dif in addition to reducing exosome release, indicating an essential role of ATP6AP2 enrichment in CLR-Ms for the induction of Neu-Dif. The mechanism is dependent on CLR-M dynamics, particularly the membrane fluidity. Knockdown of ATP6AP2 inhibited Neu-Dif but increased astrocytic-Dif, depleted ATP6AP2/flotillin/Gαq but accumulated caveolin/Gαi in CLR-Ms, and blocked the activation of JNK/ERK/c-Jun/CREB/exosome release. siATP6AP2 cells treated with sphingomyelinase/methyl-β-cyclodextrin reversed the levels of caveolin/flotillin in CLR-Ms but did not induce Neu-Dif, indicating the crucial relocalization of ATP6AP2 in CLR-Ms for neurogenesis. Treatment of ND-derived cells with nSMase showed reversibility in ATP6AP2 abundance in CLR-Ms and enhanced Neu-Dif. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives evidence of the determinant role of CLR-M ATP6AP2 localization for neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation involving mechanisms of switches from Gαi/caveolin/canonical to Gαq/flotillin/PCP, the ERK/JNK pathway and Ca2+-dependent release of exosomes and as a potential target of drug therapy for neurodegenerative disorders.

Genome alignment, evolution of prokaryotic genome organization, and prediction of gene function using genomic context.	Genome Res	2001	Gene order in prokaryotes is conserved to a much lesser extent than protein sequences. Only several operons, primarily those that code for physically interacting proteins, are conserved in all or most of the bacterial and archaeal genomes. Nevertheless, even the limited conservation of operon organization that is observed can provide valuable evolutionary and functional clues through multiple genome comparisons. A program for constructing gapped local alignments of conserved gene strings in two genomes was developed. The statistical significance of the local alignments was assessed using Monte Carlo simulations. Sets of local alignments were generated for all pairs of completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes, and for each genome a template-anchored multiple alignment was constructed. In most pairwise genome comparisons, <10% of the genes in each genome belonged to conserved gene strings. When closely related pairs of species (i.e., two mycoplasmas) are excluded, the total coverage of genomes by conserved gene strings ranged from <5% for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp to 24% for the minimal genome of Mycoplasma genitalium, and 23% in Thermotoga maritima. The coverage of the archaeal genomes was only slightly lower than that of bacterial genomes. The majority of the conserved gene strings are known operons, with the ribosomal superoperon being the top-scoring string in most genome comparisons. However, in some of the bacterial-archaeal pairs, the superoperon is rearranged to the extent that other operons, primarily those subject to horizontal transfer, show the greatest level of conservation, such as the archaeal-type H+-ATPase operon or ABC-type transport cassettes. The level of gene order conservation among prokaryotic genomes was compared to the cooccurrence of genomes in clusters of orthologous genes (COGs) and to the conservation of protein sequences themselves. Only limited correlation was observed between these evolutionary variables. Gene order conservation shows a much lower variance than the cooccurrence of genomes in COGs, which indicates that intragenome homogenization via recombination occurs in evolution much faster than intergenome homogenization via horizontal gene transfer and lineage-specific gene loss. The potential of using template-anchored multiple-genome alignments for predicting functions of uncharacterized genes was quantitatively assessed. Functions were predicted or significantly clarified for approximately 90 COGs (approximately 4% of the total of 2414 analyzed COGs). The most significant predictions were obtained for the poorly characterized archaeal genomes; these include a previously uncharacterized restriction-modification system, a nuclease-helicase combination implicated in DNA repair, and the probable archaeal counterpart of the eukaryotic exosome. Multiple genome alignments are a resource for studies on operon rearrangement and disruption, which is central to our understanding of the evolution of prokaryotic genomes. Because of the rapid evolution of the gene order, the potential of genome alignment for prediction of gene functions is limited, but nevertheless, such predictions information significantly complements the results obtained through protein sequence and structure analysis.

Eur J Immunol	2004	As the human tetraspanin CD81 binds hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope glycoprotein E2, we addressed the role CD81 may play in cellular trafficking of HCV envelope proteins. Studies on HCV life cycle are complicated by the lack of a robust cell culture system; we therefore transfected mammalian cells with HCV E1-E2 cDNA, with or without human CD81 (huCD81) cDNA. In the absence of huCD81, HCV envelope proteins are almost completely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Instead, when huCD81 is present, a fraction of HCV envelope proteins passes through the Golgi apparatus, matures acquiring complex sugars and is found extracellularly associated with exosomes. These are 60-100-nm membrane vesicles enriched in tetraspanins, released into the extracellular milieu by many cell types and having fusogenic activity. We also report that human plasma contains exosomes and that in HCV patients, viral RNA is associated with these circulating vesicles. We propose that the HCV-CD81 complex leaves cells in the form of exosomes, circulates in this form and exploits the fusogenic capabilities of these vesicles to infect cells even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies.

Collection, storage, preservation, and normalization of human urinary exosomes for biomarker discovery.	Kidney Int	2006	Urinary exosomes containing apical membrane and intracellular fluid are normally secreted into the urine from all nephron segments, and may carry protein markers of renal dysfunction and structural injury. We studied methods for collection, storage, and preservation of urinary exosomal proteins. We collected urine from healthy volunteers, added protease inhibitors, and stored urine samples at 4, -20, and -80 degrees C for 1 week or 7 months. Samples were thawed with and without extensive vortexing, and three fractions were isolated: urinary sediment, supernatant, and exosome fraction. Protein concentration, electrophoresis patterns, and abundance of seven exosome-associated proteins were measured. Exosome-associated proteins were not detected in sediment or supernatant fractions. Protease inhibitors prevented degradation of exosome-associated proteins. Freezing at -20 degrees C caused a major loss in exosomes compared to fresh urine. In contrast, recovery after freezing at -80 degrees C was almost complete. Extensive vortexing after thawing markedly increased exosome recovery in urine frozen at -20 or -80 degrees C, even if frozen for 7 months. The recovery from first and second morning urine was similar. The abundance of cytosolic exosome-associated proteins did not decrease during long-term storage. We concluded: (1) protease inhibitors are essential for preservation; (2) storage at -80 degrees C with extensive vortexing after thawing maximizes the recovery of urinary exosomes; (3) the difference between first and second morning urine exosome-associated protein was small, suggesting minimal protein degradation in the urinary tract/bladder; (4) urinary exosomes remain intact during long-term storage. These urine collection, storage, and processing conditions may be useful for future biomarker discovery efforts.	PMC2276656

Anal Biochem	2007	A fast and robust method for the determination of platinum in human subcellular microsamples by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was developed, characterized, and validated. Samples of isolated DNA and exosome fractions from human ovarian (2008) and melanoma (T289) cancer cell lines were used. To keep the sample consumption to approximately 10 microl and obtain a high robustness of the system, a flow injection sample introduction system with a 4.6-microl sample loop was used in combination with a conventional pneumatic nebulizer and a spray chamber. The system was optimized with respect to signal/noise ratio using a multivariate experimental design. The system proved to be well suited for routine analysis of large sample series, and several hundreds of samples could be analyzed without maintenance or downtime. The detection limit of the method was 0.12 pg (26 pg/g) platinum. To avoid systematic errors from nonspectral interferences, it was necessary to use reagent matched calibration standards or isotope dilution analysis. An uncertainty budget was constructed to estimate the total expanded uncertainty of the method, giving a quantification limit of 2.3 pg (0.5 ng/g) platinum in DNA samples. The uncertainty was sufficiently low to study quantitative differences in the formation of Pt-DNA adducts after treatment with cisplatin using different exposure times and concentrations.

Identification of Tim4 as a phosphatidylserine receptor.	Nature	2007	In programmed cell death, a large number of cells undergo apoptosis, and are engulfed by macrophages to avoid the release of noxious materials from the dying cells. In definitive erythropoiesis, nuclei are expelled from erythroid precursor cells and are engulfed by macrophages. Phosphatidylserine is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells and on the nuclei expelled from erythroid precursor cells; it works as an 'eat me' signal for phagocytes. Phosphatidylserine is also expressed on the surface of exosomes involved in intercellular signalling. Here we established a library of hamster monoclonal antibodies against mouse peritoneal macrophages, and found an antibody that strongly inhibited the phosphatidylserine-dependent engulfment of apoptotic cells. The antigen recognized by the antibody was identified by expression cloning as a type I transmembrane protein called Tim4 (T-cell immunoglobulin- and mucin-domain-containing molecule; also known as Timd4). Tim4 was expressed in Mac1+ cells in various mouse tissues, including spleen, lymph nodes and fetal liver. Tim4 bound apoptotic cells by recognizing phosphatidylserine via its immunoglobulin domain. The expression of Tim4 in fibroblasts enhanced their ability to engulf apoptotic cells. When the anti-Tim4 monoclonal antibody was administered into mice, the engulfment of apoptotic cells by thymic macrophages was significantly blocked, and the mice developed autoantibodies. Among the other Tim family members, Tim1, but neither Tim2 nor Tim3, specifically bound phosphatidylserine. Tim1- or Tim4-expressing Ba/F3 B cells were bound by exosomes via phosphatidylserine, and exosomes stimulated the interaction between Tim1 and Tim4. These results indicate that Tim4 and Tim1 are phosphatidylserine receptors for the engulfment of apoptotic cells, and may also be involved in intercellular signalling in which exosomes are involved.

J Cell Biochem	2008	Membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP14) is an efficient extracellular matrix (ECM) degrading enzyme that plays important roles in tissue homeostasis and cell invasion. Like a number of type I membrane proteins, MT1-MMP can be internalized from the cell surface through early and recycling endosomes to late endosomes, and recycled to the plasma membrane. Late endosomes participate in the biogenesis of small (30-100 nm) vesicles, exosomes, which redirect plasma membrane proteins for extracellular secretion. We hypothesized that some of the endosomal MT1-MMP could be directed to exosomes for extracellular release. Using cultured human fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) and melanoma (G361) cells we provide evidence that both the full-length 60 kDa and the proteolytically processed 43 kDa forms of MT1-MMP are secreted in exosomes. The isolated exosomes were identified by their vesicular structure in electron microscopy and by exosomal marker proteins CD9 and tumor susceptibility gene (TSG101). Furthermore, exosomes contained beta1-integrin (CD29). The exosomes were able to activate pro-MMP-2 and degrade type 1 collagen and gelatin, suggesting that the exosomal MT1-MMP was functionally active. The targeting of MT1-MMP in exosomes represents a novel mechanism for cancer cells to secrete membrane type metalloproteolytic activity into the extracellular space.

Induction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells by tumor exosomes.	Int J Cancer	2009	Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) promote tumor progression. The mechanisms of MDSC development during tumor growth remain unknown. Tumor exosomes (T-exosomes) have been implicated to play a role in immune regulation, however the role of exosomes in the induction of MDSCs is unclear. Our previous work demonstrated that exosomes isolated from tumor cells are taken up by bone marrow myeloid cells. Here, we extend those findings showing that exosomes isolated from T-exosomes switch the differentiation pathway of these myeloid cells to the MDSC pathway (CD11b(+)Gr-1(+)). The resulting cells exhibit MDSC phenotypic and functional characteristics including promotion of tumor growth. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in vivo MDSC mediated promotion of tumor progression is dependent on T-exosome prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and TGF-beta molecules. T-exosomes can induce the accumulation of MDSCs expressing Cox2, IL-6, VEGF, and arginase-1. Antibodies against exosomal PGE2 and TGF-beta block the activity of these exosomes on MDSC induction and therefore attenuate MDSC-mediated tumor-promoting ability. Exosomal PGE2 and TGF-beta are enriched in T-exosomes when compared with exosomes isolated from the supernatants of cultured tumor cells (C-exosomes). The tumor microenvironment has an effect on the potency of T-exosome mediated induction of MDSCs by regulating the sorting and the amount of exosomal PGE2 and TGF-beta available. Together, these findings lend themselves to developing specific targetable therapeutic strategies to reduce or eliminate MDSC-induced immunosuppression and hence enhance host antitumor immunotherapy efficacy.

Cellular prion protein in blood platelets associates with both lipid rafts and the cytoskeleton.	Thromb Haemost	2009	The recently shown transmissibility of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion emphasises the need for better understanding of the cellular prion protein (PrPc) in blood. A substantial amount of cell-associated PrPc in blood resides in platelets. Platelet activation leads to up-regulation of PrPc on the platelet surface and its release on exosomes and microparticles. The sub-cellular localisation and function of platelet PrPc, however, is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the association of PrPc with platelet lipid rafts and the platelet cytoskeleton. Immuno-fluorescence microscopy showed that the signals of PrPc and P-selectin, both of which occupy intracellular alpha granules, were separated on the membrane, suggesting organisation in different membrane domains. A flotation assay of platelet lysates demonstrated that a relatively small portion of platelet PrPc floats with lipid rafts, regardless of platelet activation status. This was reversed by depolymerisation of the platelet cytoskeleton, which led to flotation of most platelet PrPc, suggesting that interactions with the cytoskeleton prevent flotation of PrPc rafts. This association of PrPc with the platelet cytoskeleton was confirmed by its presence in both the isolated membrane skeleton and actin cytoskeleton. Platelet activation significantly increased the amount of PrPc associated with the cytoskeleton. Our results indicate that the localisation of PrPc in platelets is complex, with the majority of PrPc present within platelet lipid rafts linked to the platelet cytoskeleton. This localisation places PrPc in a position where it can interact with proteins involved in platelet signalling and eventually with vCJD prions.

New mechanism for Notch signaling to endothelium at a distance by Delta-like 4 incorporation into exosomes.	Blood	2010	Notch signaling is an evolutionary conserved pathway that is mediated by cell-cell contact. It is involved in a variety of developmental processes and has an essential role in vascular development and angiogenesis. Delta-like 4 (Dll4) is a Notch ligand that is up-regulated during angiogenesis. It is expressed in endothelial cells and regulates the differentiation between tip cells and stalk cells of neovasculature. Here, we present evidence that Dll4 is incorporated into endothelial exosomes. It can also be incorporated into the exosomes of tumor cells that overexpress Dll4. These exosomes can transfer the Dll4 protein to other endothelial cells and incorporate it into their cell membrane, which results in an inhibition of Notch signaling and a loss of Notch receptor. Transfer of Dll4 was also shown in vivo from tumor cells to host endothelium. Addition of Dll4 exosomes confers a tip cell phenotype on the endothelial cell, which results in a high Dll4/Notch-receptor ratio, low Notch signaling, and filopodia formation. This was further evidenced by increased branching in a tube-formation assay and in vivo. This reversal in phenotype appears to enhance vessel formation and is a new form of signaling for Notch ligands that expands their signaling potential beyond cell-cell contact.

Commun Integr Biol	2010	Exosomes are specialized membranous nano-sized vesicles derived from endocytic compartments that are released by many cell types. Microvesicles are distinctive from exosomes in that they are produced by shedding of the plasmamembrane and usually larger in size (>1 µm). Exosome biogenesis involves the tightly controlled process of inward budding from the limiting membrane of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). This results in numerous intraluminal vesicles in the lumen of MVBs that contain distinct protein repertoires. It has been suggested that microvesicles shed by certain tumor cells hold functional messenger RNA (mRNA) that may promote tumor progression. We discovered that purified exosomes contain functional microRNAs (miRNAs) and small RNA, but detected little mRNA. Although a clear and decisive distinction between microvesicles and exosomes cannot be made and different subsets of exosomes exist, we speculate that exosomes are specialized in carrying small RNA including the class 22-25 nucleotide regulatory miRNAs. To demonstrate this we developed a co-culture system and found that exosomes are continuously secreted and transferred from Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-infected cells to uninfected neighboring cells. Throughout exosome transfer, the exogenous EBV-encoded miRNAs were delivered to subcellular sites of miRNA-mediated gene repression. Additionally, we found evidence that mature miRNAs are transferred between circulating cells in humans, since we detected EBV-miRNAs in non-infected cells in the peripheral blood of patients that include monocytes and T cells. In this addendum we discuss these findings in the context of recently published papers that advanced our current knowledge of exosome physiology, (mi)RNA function and intercellular RNA transfer. Based on this information we propose that an intercellular (miRNA-based) mode of signal transmission may be well suited in controlling space-confined processes such as the initiation of immune responses in the secondary (peripheral) lymphoid tissues or in a tumor microenvironment. Deciphering the molecular mechanism(s) that control small RNA loading into exosomes and transfer to recipient cells in vitro will provide new evidence for the physiological relevance of vesicle-mediated intercellular communication in vivo.

Cell Signal	2011	Small microvesicles, such as microparticles and exosomes, have been demonstrated to transfer proteins and nucleic acids from a variety of donor to acceptor cells with corresponding (patho)physiological consequences. Recently the in vitro transfer of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins from microvesicles released from large rat adipocytes to intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) of small adipocytes has been shown to be upregulated by physiological (palmitate, H(2)O(2)) and pharmacological (anti-diabetic sulfonylurea drug glimepiride) stimuli and to increase the esterification into as well as to reduce the release of fatty acids from triacylglycerol. Here microvesicles derived from (preferentially large) rat adipocytes or plasma and harboring the GPI-anchored proteins, Gce1 and CD73, were demonstrated to contain specific transcripts and microRNAs that are both transferred into and expressed in acceptor adipocytes and are involved in the upregulation of lipogenesis and cell size. The transferred transcripts were specific for fatty acid esterification (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-3, diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2), lipid droplet biogenesis (FSP27, caveolin-1) and adipokines (leptin, adiponectin). The transfer and lipogenic activity were more efficient for small rather than large acceptor adipocytes and significantly upregulated by palmitate, glimepiride and H(2)O(2). Together the data suggest that microvesicles released from large adipocytes stimulate lipid storage in small adipocytes by mediating horizontal transfer of lipogenic information which is encoded by relevant (micro)RNA and GPI-anchored protein species. Paracrine and endocrine regulation of lipid storage and, in parallel, cell size of white adipocytes by specific (micro)RNAs in GPI-anchored protein-harboring microvesicles may represent a novel target for interference with metabolic diseases, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome.

PLoS One	2011	In natural or experimental oral scrapie infection of sheep, disease associated prion protein (PrP(d)) often first accumulates in Peyer's patch (PP) follicles. The route by which infectivity reaches the follicles is unknown, however, intestinal epithelial cells may participate in intestinal antigenic presentation by delivering exosomes as vehicles of luminal antigens. In a previous study using an intestinal loop model, following inoculation of scrapie brain homogenate, inoculum associated PrP(d) was detected by light microscopy shortly (15 minutes to 3.5 hours) after inoculation in the villous lacteals and sub-mucosal lymphatics. No PrP(d) was located within the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE), sub-FAE domes or the PP follicles. To evaluate this gut loop model and the transportation routes in more detail, we used electron microscopy (EM) to study intestinal tissues exposed to scrapie or control homogenates for 15 minutes to 10 days. In addition, immuno-EM was used to investigate whether exosomes produced in the FAE may possess small amounts of PrP(d) that were not detectable by light microscopy. This study showed that the integrity of the intestinal epithelium was sustained in the intestinal loop model. Despite prominent transcytotic activity and exosome release from the FAE of the ileal PP in sheep, these structures were not associated with transportation of PrP(d) across the mucosa. The study did not determine how infectivity reaches the follicles of PPs. The possibility that the infectious agent is transported across the FAE remains a possibility if it occurs in a form that is undetectable by the methods used in this study. Infectivity may also be transported via lymph to the blood and further to all other lymphoid tissues including the PP follicles, but the early presence of PrP(d) in the PP follicles during scrapie infection argues against such a mechanism.

Exosomes as extrapulmonary signaling conveyors for nanoparticle-induced systemic immune activation.	Small	2012	Evaluation of systemic biosafety of nanomaterials urgently demands a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of the undesirable interference and systemic signaling that arises between man-made nanomaterials and biological systems. It is shown that exosomes may act as signal conveyors for nanoparticle-induced systemic immune responses. Exosomes are extracellularly secreted membrane vesicles which act as Trojan horses for the dissemination and intercellular communication of natural nanosized particles (like viruses). Upon exposure to magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONs), it is possible to dose-dependently generate a significant number of exosomes in the alveolar region of BALB/c mice. These exosomes are quickly eliminated from alveoli into systemic circulation and largely transfer their signals to the immune system. Maturation of dendritic cells and activation of splenic T cells are significantly induced by these exosomes. Furthermore, exosome-induced T-cell activation is more efficient toward sensitized T cells and in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice than in the unsensitized counterparts. Activation of systemic T cells reveals a T helper 1 polarization and aggravated inflammation, which poses potential hazards to the deterioration of allergic diseases in OVA-sensitized mice. The studies suggest that exosomes may act as conveyors for extrapulmonary signal transduction in nanoparticle-induced immune systemic responses, which are the key in vivo processes of manufactured nanoparticles executing either biomedical functions or toxic responses.

Membrane transfer from oocyte to sperm occurs in two CD9-independent ways that do not supply the fertilising ability of Cd9-deleted oocytes.	Reproduction	2012	Spermatozoa undergo regulation of their functions along their lifespan through exchanges via vesicles or interactions with epithelial cells, in the epididymis, in the seminal fluid and in the female genital tract. Two different ways of oocyte membrane transfer to spermatozoa have been described: trogocytosis and exosomes. We here report an analysis of in vitro exchanges between the membranes of unfertilised oocytes and capacitated spermatozoa. We showed that optimum conditions are fulfilled when unfertilised oocytes interact with acrosome-reacted spermatozoa, a scenario mimicking the events occurring when the fertilising spermatozoon is inside the perivitelline space. Although CD9 tetraspanin is an essential molecule for fertilisation, exosome and trogocytosis transfer persists in Cd9-null oocytes in spite of their dramatic fusion failure. These exchanges are CD9 tetraspanin independent. We also confirm that mice sperm express CD9 tetraspanin and that when Cd9-null oocytes were inseminated with sperm covered with oocyte membrane materials, including CD9 tetraspanin, no rescue of the oocytes' fertilisability could be obtained. Thus, the existence of two ways of exchange between gametes during fertilisation suggests that these events could be of a physiological importance in this process.

Prion-infected cells regulate the release of exosomes with distinct ultrastructural features.	FASEB J	2012	Exosomes are small membrane-bound vesicles released from cells and found in vivo in most biological fluids. Functions reported for exosomes include cell-cell communication, roles in modulating immune responses, and roles in the transfer of pathogens such as prions. Here we investigated the molecular characteristics of the structure of exosomes that harbor prion infectivity to determine the native structure of exosomes and whether infected exosomes have a distinct structure. Cryo-electron tomography revealed the previously unidentified ultrastructural detail of exosomes with high resolution. Exosomes were found to be naturally spherical in shape and to have a diverse population that varies in size and internal structure, such as differences in the number of membrane structures. Exosomes isolated from prion-infected cells contained a significantly different population of exosomes with distinct structural features compared to control vesicles from mock-infected cells. Exosomes are highly structured vesicles that can modify their structure on altering their protein cargo. This finding provides further insight into the role that the exosomal protein cargo plays on influencing the structure of the vesicles as well as highlighting the diversity of exosomes and their relationship to biological processes.

We isolated stem cells from the subepithelial layer of the umbilical cord; the cells could be expanded for greater than 90 population doubling and had mesenchymal stem cell characteristics, expressing CD9, SSEA4, CD44, CD90, CD166, CD73, and CD146 but were negative for STRO-1. The cells can be directionally differentiated and undergo osteo-, chondro-, adipo-, and cardiogenesis. In addition, we have identified for the first time that mesenchymal stem cells isolated from umbilical cord can produce microvesicles, termed exosomes. This is the first report describing a stem cell population isolated from the subepithelial layer of the umbilical cord. Given the growth capacity, multilineage potential, and most importantly the low levels of HLA-ABC, we propose that this novel cell isolated from the subepithelial layer of umbilical cord is an ideal candidate for allogeneic cell-based therapy.

Neuronal exosomal miRNA-dependent translational regulation of astroglial glutamate transporter GLT1.	J Biol Chem	2013	Perisynaptic astrocytes express important glutamate transporters, especially excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2, rodent analog GLT1) to regulate extracellular glutamate levels and modulate synaptic activation. In this study, we investigated an exciting new pathway, the exosome-mediated transfer of microRNA (in particular, miR-124a), in neuron-to-astrocyte signaling. Exosomes isolated from neuron-conditioned medium contain abundant microRNAs and small RNAs. These exosomes can be directly internalized into astrocytes and increase astrocyte miR-124a and GLT1 protein levels. Direct miR-124a transfection also significantly and selectively increases protein (but not mRNA) expression levels of GLT1 in cultured astrocytes. Consistent with our in vitro findings, intrastriatal injection of specific antisense against miR-124a into adult mice dramatically reduces GLT1 protein expression and glutamate uptake levels in striatum without reducing GLT1 mRNA levels. MiR-124a-mediated regulation of GLT1 expression appears to be indirect and is not mediated by its suppression of the putative GLT1 inhibitory ligand ephrinA3. Moreover, miR-124a is selectively reduced in the spinal cord tissue of end-stage SOD1 G93A mice, the mouse model of ALS. Subsequent exogenous delivery of miR-124a in vivo through stereotaxic injection significantly prevents further pathological loss of GLT1 proteins, as determined by GLT1 immunoreactivity in SOD1 G93A mice. Together, our study characterized a new neuron-to-astrocyte communication pathway and identified miRNAs that modulate GLT1 protein expression in astrocytes in vitro and in vivo.	PMC3591620

Visualization and in vivo tracking of the exosomes of murine melanoma B16-BL6 cells in mice after intravenous injection.	J Biotechnol	2013	The development of exosomes as delivery vehicles requires understanding how and where exogenously administered exosomes are distributed in vivo. In the present study, we designed a fusion protein consisting of Gaussia luciferase and a truncated lactadherin, gLuc-lactadherin, and constructed a plasmid expressing the fusion protein. B16-BL6 murine melanoma cells were transfected with the plasmid, and exosomes released from the cells were collected by ultracentrifugation. Strong luciferase activity was detected in the fraction containing exosomes, indicating their efficient labeling with gLuc-lactadherin. Then, the labeled B16-BL6 exosomes were intravenously injected into mice, and their tissue distribution was evaluated. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the exosome blood concentration-time profile revealed that B16-BL6 exosomes disappeared very quickly from the blood circulation with a half-life of approximately 2min. Little luciferase activity was detected in the serum at 4h after exosome injection, suggesting rapid clearance of B16-BL6 exosomes in vivo. Moreover, sequential in vivo imaging revealed that the B16-BL6 exosome-derived signals distributed first to the liver and then to the lungs. These results indicate that gLuc-lactadherin labeling is useful for tracing exosomes in vivo and that B16-BL6 exosomes are rapidly cleared from the blood circulation after systemic administration.

Identification and analysis of circulating exosomal microRNA in human body fluids.	Methods Mol Biol	2013	Exosomes are 40-100 nm sized vesicles released from cells when multivesicular bodies fuse with the plasma membrane. These vesicles take part in cell-to-cell communication by binding and signalling through membrane receptors on cells or by transferring proteins, RNA, and lipids into the cells. Exosomal RNA in body fluids, such as plasma and urine, has been associated with malignancies, making the exosomal RNA a potential biomarker for early detection of these diseases. This has increased the interest in the field of extracellular RNA and in particular, the interest in exosomal RNA.In this chapter, a well-established exosome isolation method is described, as well as how to characterize the isolated vesicles by electron microscopy. Furthermore, two types of RNA isolation methods are described with a focus on isolating RNA from body fluids, which can be more viscous than cell culture media.

Dev Biol	2013	In the frog Xenopus laevis, dorsal-ventral axis specification involves cytoskeleton-dependent transport of localized transcripts and proteins during the first cell cycle, and activation of the canonical Wnt pathway to locally stabilize translated beta-catenin which, by as early as the 32-cell stage, commits nuclei in prospective dorsal lineages to the subsequent expression of dorsal target genes. Maternal ligands important for activating this dorsal-specific signaling pathway are thought to interact with secreted glypicans and coreceptors in the blastocoel. While diffusion between cells is generally thought of as sufficient to accomplish the distribution of secreted maternal ligands to their appropriate targets, signaling may also involve other potential mechanisms, including direct transfer of morphogens via membrane-bounded entities, such as argosomes, exosomes, or even filopodia. In Xenopus, the blastocoel-facing, basolateral surfaces where signaling interactions ostensibly take place have not been previously examined in detail. Here, we report that the cleavage-stage blastocoel is traversed by hundreds of extremely long cellular protrusions that maintain long-term contacts between nonadjacent blastomeres during expansion of the interstitial space in early embryogenesis. The involvement of these protrusions in early embryonic patterning is suggested by the discoveries that (a) they fragment into microvesicles, whose resorption facilitates considerable exchange of cytoplasm and membrane between blastomeres; and (b) they are active in caveolar endocytosis, a prerequisite for ligand-receptor signaling.

Large oncosomes mediate intercellular transfer of functional microRNA.	Cell Cycle	2013	Prostate cancer cells release atypically large extracellular vesicles (EVs), termed large oncosomes, which may play a role in the tumor microenvironment by transporting bioactive molecules across tissue spaces and through the blood stream. In this study, we applied a novel method for selective isolation of large oncosomes applicable to human platelet-poor plasma, where the presence of caveolin-1-positive large oncosomes identified patients with metastatic disease. This procedure was also used to validate results of a miRNA array performed on heterogeneous populations of EVs isolated from tumorigenic RWPE-2 prostate cells and from isogenic non-tumorigenic RWPE-1 cells. The results showed that distinct classes of miRNAs are expressed at higher levels in EVs derived from the tumorigenic cells in comparison to their non-tumorigenic counterpart. Large oncosomes enhanced migration of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), an effect that was increased by miR-1227, a miRNA abundant in large oncosomes produced by RWPE-2 cells. Our findings suggest that large oncosomes in the circulation report metastatic disease in patients with prostate cancer, and that this class of EV harbors functional molecules that may play a role in conditioning the tumor microenvironment.

Exosomal and Non-Exosomal Transport of Extra-Cellular microRNAs in Follicular Fluid: Implications for Bovine Oocyte Developmental Competence.	PLoS One	2013	Cell-cell communication within the follicle involves many signaling molecules, and this process may be mediated by secretion and uptake of exosomes that contain several bioactive molecules including extra-cellular miRNAs. Follicular fluid and cells from individual follicles of cattle were grouped based on Brilliant Cresyl Blue (BCB) staining of the corresponding oocytes. Both Exoquick precipitation and differential ultracentrifugation were used to separate the exosome and non-exosomal fraction of follicular fluid. Following miRNA isolation from both fractions, the human miRCURY LNA™ Universal RT miRNA PCR array system was used to profile miRNA expression. This analysis found that miRNAs were present in both exosomal and non-exosomal fraction of bovine follicular fluid. We found 25 miRNAs differentially expressed (16 up and 9 down) in exosomes and 30 miRNAs differentially expressed (21 up and 9 down) in non-exosomal fraction of follicular fluid in comparison of BCB- versus BCB+ oocyte groups. Expression of selected miRNAs was detected in theca, granulosa and cumulus oocyte complex. To further explore the potential roles of these follicular fluid derived extra-cellular miRNAs, the potential target genes were predicted, and functional annotation and pathway analysis revealed most of these pathways are known regulators of follicular development and oocyte growth. In order to validate exosome mediated cell-cell communication within follicular microenvironment, we demonstrated uptake of exosomes and resulting increase of endogenous miRNA level and subsequent alteration of mRNA levels in follicular cells in vitro. This study demonstrates for the first time, the presence of exosome or non-exosome mediated transfer of miRNA in the bovine follicular fluid, and oocyte growth dependent variation in extra-cellular miRNA signatures in the follicular environment.

Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells suppress angiogenesis by down-regulating VEGF expression in breast cancer cells.	PLoS One	2013	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles released by a variety of cell types. Exosomes contain genetic materials, such as mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs), implying that they may play a pivotal role in cell-to-cell communication. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which potentially differentiate into multiple cell types, can migrate to the tumor sites and have been reported to exert complex effects on tumor progression. To elucidate the role of MSCs within the tumor microenvironment, previous studies have suggested various mechanisms such as immune modulation and secreted factors of MSCs. However, the paracrine effects of MSC-derived exosomes on the tumor microenvironment remain to be explored. The hypothesis of this study was that MSC-derived exosomes might reprogram tumor behavior by transferring their molecular contents. To test this hypothesis, exosomes from MSCs were isolated and characterized. MSC-derived exosomes exhibited different protein and RNA profiles compared with their donor cells and these vesicles could be internalized by breast cancer cells. The results demonstrated that MSC-derived exosomes significantly down-regulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumor cells, which lead to inhibition of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, miR-16, a miRNA known to target VEGF, was enriched in MSC-derived exosomes and it was partially responsible for the anti-angiogenic effect of MSC-derived exosomes. The collective results suggest that MSC-derived exosomes may serve as a significant mediator of cell-to-cell communication within the tumor microenvironment and suppress angiogenesis by transferring anti-angiogenic molecules.

Lab Chip	2014	Exosomes/microvesicles are known to shuttle biological signals between cells, possibly by transferring biological signal components such as encapsulated RNAs and proteins, plasma membrane proteins, or both. Therefore exosomes are being considered for use as RNA and protein delivery vehicles for various therapeutic applications. However, living cells in nature secrete only a small number of exosomes, and procedures to collect them are complex; these complications impede their use in mass delivery of components to targeted cells. We propose a novel and efficient method that forces cells through hydrophilic microchannels to generate artificial nanovesicles. These mimetic nanovesicles contain mRNAs, intracellular proteins and plasma membrane proteins, and are shaped like cell-secreted exosomes. When recipient cells are exposed to nanovesicles from embryonic stem cells, mRNAs of Oct 3/4 and Nanog are transferred from embryonic stem cells to the target cells. This result suggests that mimetic nanovesicles can be used as vehicles to deliver RNA. This nanovesicle formation method is expected to be used in exosome research and to have applications in drug and RNA-delivery systems.

Lab Chip	2014	Membrane bound vesicles, including microvesicles and exosomes, are secreted by both normal and cancerous cells into the extracellular space and in blood circulation. These circulating extracellular vesicles (cirEVs) and exosomes in particular are recognized as a potential source of disease biomarkers. However, to exploit the use of circulatory exosomes as a biomarker, a rapid, high-throughput and reproducible method is required for their isolation and molecular analysis. We have developed a simple, low cost microfluidic-based platform to isolate cirEVs enriched in exosomes directly from blood serum allowing simultaneous capture and quantification of exosomes in a single device. To capture specific exosomes, we employed "ExoChip", a microfluidic device fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and functionalized with antibodies against CD63, an antigen commonly overexpressed in exosomes. Subsequent staining with a fluorescent carbocyanine dye (DiO) that specifically labels the exosomes, we quantitated exosomes using a standard plate-reader. Ten independent ExoChip experiments performed using serum obtained from five pancreatic cancer patients and five healthy individuals revealed a statistically significant increase (2.34 ± 0.31 fold, p < 0.001) in exosomes captured in cancer patients when compared to healthy individuals. Exosomal origins of ExoChip immobilized vesicles were further confirmed using immuno-electron-microscopy and Western blotting. In addition, we demonstrate the ability of ExoChip to recover exosomes with intact RNA enabling profiling of exosomal-microRNAs through openarray analysis, which has potential applications in biomarker discovery. Based on our findings, ExoChip is a well suited platform to be used as an exosome-based diagnostic and research tool for molecular screening of human cancers.	PMC4134440

Nucleic Acids Res	2014	Semen contains relatively ill-defined regulatory components that likely aid fertilization, but which could also interfere with defense against infection. Each ejaculate contains trillions of exosomes, membrane-enclosed subcellular microvesicles, which have immunosuppressive effects on cells important in the genital mucosa. Exosomes in general are believed to mediate inter-cellular communication, possibly by transferring small RNA molecules. We found that seminal exosome (SE) preparations contain a substantial amount of RNA from 20 to 100 nucleotides (nts) in length. We sequenced 20-40 and 40-100 nt fractions of SE RNA separately from six semen donors. We found various classes of small non-coding RNA, including microRNA (21.7% of the RNA in the 20-40 nt fraction) as well as abundant Y RNAs and tRNAs present in both fractions. Specific RNAs were consistently present in all donors. For example, 10 (of ∼2600 known) microRNAs constituted over 40% of mature microRNA in SE. Additionally, tRNA fragments were strongly enriched for 5'-ends of 18-19 or 30-34 nts in length; such tRNA fragments repress translation. Thus, SE could potentially deliver regulatory signals to the recipient mucosa via transfer of small RNA molecules.	PMC4066774

J Cell Sci	2014	The transfer of exosomes containing both genetic and protein materials is necessary for the control of the cancer cell microenvironment to promote tumor angiogenesis. The nature and function of proteins found in the exosomal cargo, and the mechanism of their action in membrane transport and related signaling events are not clearly understood. In this study, we demonstrate, in human lung cancer A549 cells, that the exosome release mechanism is closely linked to the multifaceted receptor sortilin (also called neurotensin receptor 3). Sortilin is already known to be important for cancer cell function. Here, we report for the first time its role in the assembly of a tyrosine kinase complex and subsequent exosome release. This new complex (termed the TES complex) is found in exosomes and results in the linkage of the two tyrosine kinase receptors TrkB (also known as NTRK2) and EGFR with sortilin. Using in vitro models, we demonstrate that this sortilin-containing complex exhibits a control on endothelial cells and angiogenesis activation through exosome transfer.

Electronic address: .	michele.depalma@epfl.ch		Endogenous RNAs modulate microRNA sorting to exosomes and transfer to acceptor cells.	Cell Rep	2014	MicroRNA (miRNA) transfer via exosomes may mediate cell-to-cell communication. Interestingly, specific miRNAs are enriched in exosomes in a cell-type-dependent fashion. However, the mechanisms whereby miRNAs are sorted to exosomes and the significance of miRNA transfer to acceptor cells are unclear. We used macrophages and endothelial cells (ECs) as a model of heterotypic cell communication in order to investigate both processes. RNA profiling of macrophages and their exosomes shows that miRNA sorting to exosomes is modulated by cell-activation-dependent changes of miRNA target levels in the producer cells. Genetically perturbing the expression of individual miRNAs or their targeted transcripts promotes bidirectional miRNA relocation from the cell cytoplasm/P bodies (sites of miRNA activity) to multivesicular bodies (sites of exosome biogenesis) and controls miRNA sorting to exosomes. Furthermore, the use of Dicer-deficient cells and reporter lentiviral vectors (LVs) for miRNA activity shows that exosomal miRNAs are transferred from macrophages to ECs to detectably repress targeted sequences.

Exosomes from hepatitis C infected patients transmit HCV infection and contain replication competent viral RNA in complex with Ago2-miR122-HSP90.	PLoS Pathog	2014	Antibodies targeting receptor-mediated entry of HCV into hepatocytes confer limited therapeutic benefits. Evidence suggests that exosomes can transfer genetic materials between cells; however, their role in HCV infection remains obscure. Here, we show that exosomes isolated from sera of chronic HCV infected patients or supernatants of J6/JFH1-HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells contained HCV RNA. These exosomes could mediate viral receptor-independent transmission of HCV to hepatocytes. Negative sense HCV RNA, indicative of replication competent viral RNA, was present in exosomes of all HCV infected treatment non-responders and some treatment-naïve individuals. Remarkably, HCV RNA was associated with Ago2, HSP90 and miR-122 in exosomes isolated from HCV-infected individuals or HCV-infected Huh7.5 cell supernatants. Exosome-loading with a miR-122 inhibitor, or inhibition of HSP90, vacuolar H+-ATPases, and proton pumps, significantly suppressed exosome-mediated HCV transmission to naïve cells. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence for HCV transmission by blood-derived exosomes and highlight potential therapeutic strategies.	PMC4183590

Gastroenterology	2015	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) make up a large proportion of the nonparenchymal cells in the liver. LSECs are involved in induction of immune tolerance, but little is known about their functions during hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. METHODS: Primary human LSECs (HLSECs) and immortalized liver endothelial cells (TMNK-1) were exposed to various forms of HCV, including full-length transmitted/founder virus, sucrose-purified Japanese fulminant hepatitis-1 (JFH-1), a virus encoding a luciferase reporter, and the HCV-specific pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules. Cells were analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence, immunohistochemical, and polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: HLSECs internalized HCV, independent of cell-cell contacts; HCV RNA was translated but not replicated. Through pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like receptor 7 and retinoic acid-inducible gene 1), HCV RNA induced consistent and broad transcription of multiple interferons (IFNs); supernatants from primary HLSECs transfected with HCV-specific pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules increased induction of IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes in HLSECs. Recombinant type I and type III IFNs strongly up-regulated HLSEC transcription of IFN λ3 (IFNL3) and viperin (RSAD2), which inhibit replication of HCV. Compared with CD8(+) T cells, HLSECs suppressed HCV replication within Huh7.5.1 cells, also inducing IFN-stimulated genes in co-culture. Conditioned media from IFN-stimulated HLSECs induced expression of antiviral genes by uninfected primary human hepatocytes. Exosomes, derived from HLSECs after stimulation with either type I or type III IFNs, controlled HCV replication in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Cultured HLSECs produce factors that mediate immunity against HCV. HLSECs induce self-amplifying IFN-mediated responses and release of exosomes with antiviral activity.	PMC4765499

Highly skewed distribution of miRNAs and proteins between colorectal cancer cells and their exosomes following Cetuximab treatment: biomolecular, genetic and translational implications.	Oncoscience	2014	Exchange of molecules via exosomes is a means of eukaryotic intercellular communication, especially within tumour microenvironments. However, no data are available on alterations of exosomal molecular cargo by environmental cues (eg, pharmacological treatments). To approach this issue, we compared the abundance of 754 miRNAs and 741 cancer-related proteins in exosomes secreted by Caco-2 (Cetuximab-responsive) and HCT- 116 (Cetuximab-resistant) CRC cells, before and after Cetuximab treatment, with that in their source cells. Cetuximab significantly altered the cargo of Caco-2 exosomes: it increased abundance of miRNAs and proteins activating proliferation and inflammation and reduced miRNAs and proteins related to immune suppression. These alterations did not precisely mirror those in source cells, suggesting a Cetuximab-linked effect. Analogous alterations were detected in HCT-116. Transfection of exosomes from Cetuximab-treated Caco-2 into HCT-116 significantly increased HCT-116 viability; conversely, no viability alteration was detected in Caco-2 transfected with exosomes from Cetuximab-treated HCT-116. Analysis of networks, comprising targets of differentially expressed (DE) exosomal miRNAs and DE exosomal proteins, demonstrates a significant involvement of processes related to proliferation, inflammation, immune response, apoptosis. Our data extend existing knowledge on molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic intercellular communication, especially in oncological processes. Their translation to clinical settings may add new weapons to existing therapeutic repertoires against cancer.	PMC4278285

Improved characterization of EV preparations based on protein to lipid ratio and lipid properties.	PLoS One	2015	In recent years the study of extracellular vesicles has gathered much scientific and clinical interest. As the field is expanding, it is becoming clear that better methods for characterization and quantification of extracellular vesicles as well as better standards to compare studies are warranted. The goal of the present work was to find improved parameters to characterize extracellular vesicle preparations. Here we introduce a simple 96 well plate-based total lipid assay for determination of lipid content and protein to lipid ratios of extracellular vesicle preparations from various myeloid and lymphoid cell lines as well as blood plasma. These preparations included apoptotic bodies, microvesicles/microparticles, and exosomes isolated by size-based fractionation. We also investigated lipid bilayer order of extracellular vesicle subpopulations using Di-4-ANEPPDHQ lipid probe, and lipid composition using affinity reagents to clustered cholesterol (monoclonal anti-cholesterol antibody) and ganglioside GM1 (cholera toxin subunit B). We have consistently found different protein to lipid ratios characteristic for the investigated extracellular vesicle subpopulations which were substantially altered in the case of vesicular damage or protein contamination. Spectral ratiometric imaging and flow cytometric analysis also revealed marked differences between the various vesicle populations in their lipid order and their clustered membrane cholesterol and GM1 content. Our study introduces for the first time a simple and readily available lipid assay to complement the widely used protein assays in order to better characterize extracellular vesicle preparations. Besides differentiating extracellular vesicle subpopulations, the novel parameters introduced in this work (protein to lipid ratio, lipid bilayer order, and lipid composition), may prove useful for quality control of extracellular vesicle related basic and clinical studies.

Identification of distinct circulating exosomes in Parkinson's disease.	Ann Clin Transl Neurol	2015	OBJECTIVE: Whether circulating microvesicles convey bioactive signals in neurodegenerative diseases remains currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the biochemical composition and biological function of exosomes isolated from sera of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Proteomic analysis was performed on microvesicle preparations from grouped samples of patients with genetic and sporadic forms of PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and healthy subjects. Nanoparticle-tracking analysis was used to assess the number and size of exosomes between patient groups. To interrogate their biological effect, microvesicles were added to primary rat cortical neurons subjected to either nutrient deprivation or sodium arsenite. RESULTS: Among 1033 proteins identified, 23 exosome-associated proteins were differentially abundant in PD, including the regulator of exosome biogenesis syntenin 1. These protein changes were detected despite similar exosome numbers across groups suggesting that they may reflect exosome subpopulations with distinct functions. Accordingly, we showed in models of neuronal stress that Parkinson's-derived microvesicles have a protective effect. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, these data suggest for the first time that immunophenotyping of circulating exosome subpopulations in PD may lead to a better understanding of the systemic response to neurodegeneration and the development of novel therapeutics.

Nephrol Dial Transplant	2015	BACKGROUND: Despite overall improvement in prognosis, 10-30% of patients with lupus nephritis (LN) will develop end-stage renal disease. To date, renal biopsy is still the 'gold standard' test used to predict renal outcome. However, due to its invasive nature, new non-invasive biomarkers are required. Urinary exosomes, microvesicles released by every epithelial cell facing the urinary space, represent an ideal source of markers for renal dysfunction and injury. Here, we sought to evaluate miR-29c expression levels in urinary exosomes as a novel biomarker of renal fibrosis in LN. METHODS: Urinary exosomes were isolated from 32 samples of patients with biopsy-proven LN, 15 non-lupus chronic kidney diseases and 20 healthy controls. Electronic microscopy and western blot were used to characterize the exosomes. Expression levels of miR-29c were detected by RT-PCR quantitative and correlated with clinical and histological parameters along with the expression levels of Smad2/3, TGF-β and MMP2/9. For comparison, miRNA expression was also evaluated in the urinary pellet. RESULTS: MiR-29c levels in urinary exosomes showed a negatively strong correlation with the histological chronicity index (r = -0.898, P = 0.001) and glomerular sclerosis (r = -0.555, P = 0.007). No correlation with eGFR and creatinine levels was found. MiR-29c expression levels could predict the degree of chronicity in patients with LN with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.946 (P < 0.001) and with high sensitivity and specificity (94% and 82%). Smad3 and MMP2 expression in urinary exosomes correlated negatively with miR-29c expression (r = -0.737 and -0.856, respectively). In the urinary pellet, no miR-29c expression was detected; however, upregulation of Smad3 and MMP2 was observed (3.54- and 5.85-fold increase). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, miR-29c correlated with the degree of renal chronicity but not with renal function, suggesting it could be used as a novel non-invasive marker of early progression to fibrosis in patients with LN.

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	Cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) by default and in response to diverse stimuli for the purpose of cell communication and tissue homeostasis. EVs are present in all body fluids including peripheral blood, and their appearance correlates with specific physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we show that physical activity is associated with the release of nano-sized EVs into the circulation. Healthy individuals were subjected to an incremental exercise protocol of cycling or running until exhaustion, and EVs were isolated from blood plasma samples taken before, immediately after and 90 min after exercise. Small EVs with the size of 100-130 nm, that carried proteins characteristic of exosomes, were significantly increased immediately after cycling exercise and declined again within 90 min at rest. In response to treadmill running, elevation of small EVs was moderate but appeared more sustained. To delineate EV release kinetics, plasma samples were additionally taken at the end of each increment of the cycling exercise protocol. Release of small EVs into the circulation was initiated in an early phase of exercise, before the individual anaerobic threshold, which is marked by the rise of lactate. Taken together, our study revealed that exercise triggers a rapid release of EVs with the characteristic size of exosomes into the circulation, initiated in the aerobic phase of exercise.

The Effect of Glucose on the Release and Bioactivity of Exosomes From First Trimester Trophoblast Cells.	J Clin Endocrinol Metab	2015	CONTEXT: Hyperglycemia and hypoxia are risk factors of metabolic complication during pregnancy. The interactions between oxygen and glucose-sensing pathways that regulate exosome bioactivity from placental cells, however, have not been established. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that exosomal signaling by placental cells (defined as the number of exosomes released per unit time and their bioactivity) is responsive to extracellular glucose concentration. METHODS: First-trimester primary trophoblast cells were incubated with D-glucose (5 mM or 25 mM) under 1%, 3%, or 8% O2 for 48 hours. Exosomes were isolated from cell-conditioned media by differential and buoyant density centrifugation. The total number of exosome vesicles was determined by quantifying immunoreactive exosomal CD63. The effect of exosomes on cytokine (granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6. IL-8, IL-10, interferon-γ, and TNF-α) release from endothelial cells was established by a protein solution array analysis. RESULTS: Glucose (25 mM) significantly increased the release of exosomes from trophoblast cells at all oxygen tensions tested (by approximately 2-fold when compared with controls, P < .001). Exosomes (100 μg/mL exosomal protein) released from trophoblast cells significantly increased (P < .05) the release of all cytokines from human umbilical vein endothelial cells when compared with the control (ie, cells without exosomes), with the exception of IL-2 and IL-10 (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The effects of high glucose on exosomes bioactivity may be recapitulated in vivo and is of clinical relevance in association with maternal insulin resistance (resulting in hyperglycemia) and preeclampsia (associated with placental insufficiency and hypoxia).

The modulation of co-stimulatory molecules by circulating exosomes in primary biliary cirrhosis.	Cell Mol Immunol	2017	Exosomes are nanoparticles of endocytic origin, secreted by a myriad of cell populations that are attracting increased attention by virtue of their ability to modulate cell-to-cell communications. They are also attracting attention in a variety of immunological issues, including autoimmunity and, in particular, their ability to regulate cytokine and chemokine activation. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is considered a model autoimmune disease, which has a highly focused cytotoxic response against biliary epithelial cells. We have isolated exosomes from plasma from 29 patients with PBC and 30 healthy controls (HCs), and studied the effect of these exosomes on co-stimulatory molecule expression and cytokine production in mononuclear cell populations using an ex vivo system. We also identified the microRNA (miRNA) populations in PBC compared to HC exosomes. We report herein that although exosomes do not change cytokine production, they do significantly alter co-stimulatory molecule expression on antigen-presenting populations. Further, we demonstrated that CD86 up-regulated expression on CD14+ monocytes, whereas CD40 up-regulated on CD11c+ dendritic cells by exosomes from patients with PBC. In addition, there were differences of miRNA expression of circulating exosomes in patients with PBC. These data have significant importance based on observations that co-stimulatory molecules play a differential role in the regulation of T-cell activation. Our observation indicated that aberrant exosomes from PBC selectively induce expression of co-stimulatory molecules in different subset of antigen-presenting cells. These alterations may involve in pathogenesis of autoimmune liver disease.Cellular & Molecular Immunology advance online publication, 21 September 2015; doi:10.1038/cmi.2015.86.	PMC5360882

J Hematol Oncol	2015	BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) displays high resistance to conventional chemotherapy. Considering that microRNA-122 (miR-122) performs an essential function to promote chemosensitivity of HCC cells, an effective vehicle-mediated miR-122 delivery may represent a promising strategy for HCC chemotherapy. An increasing interest is focused on the use of exosomes as biological vehicles for microRNAs (miRNA) transfer. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known for their capacity to produce large amounts of exosomes. This study aimed to determine whether adipose tissue-derived MSC (AMSC) exosomes can be used for miR-122 delivery. METHODS: AMSCs were transfected with a miR-122 expression plasmid. At 48 h after transfection, AMSC-derived exosomes (122-Exo) were harvested and added to recipient HCC cells. Expression levels of miR-122 in AMSCs, exosomes, and HCC cells were quantified by real-time PCR. The mRNA and protein levels of miR-122-target genes in recipient HCC cells were quantified by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The effects of 122-Exo on cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle of HCC cells were evaluated by MTT and flow cytometry analysis. Xenograft models were used to determine whether 122-Exo can sensitize HCC cells to sorafenib in vivo. RESULTS: Data showed that miR-122-transfected AMSC can effectively package miR-122 into secreted exosomes, which can mediate miR-122 communication between AMSCs and HCC cells, thereby rendering cancer cells sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents through alteration of miR-122-target gene expression in HCC cells. Moreover, intra-tumor injection of 122-Exo significantly increased the antitumor efficacy of sorafenib on HCC in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the export of miR-122 via AMSC exosomes represents a novel strategy to enhance HCC chemosensitivity.	PMC4627430

J Transl Med	2015	BACKGROUND: Tumour cells release membrane micro(nano)fragments called tumour-derived microvesicles (TMV) that are believed to play an important role in cancer progression. TMV suppress/modify antitumour response of the host, but there is also some evidence for their direct interaction with cancer cells. In cancer patients TMV are present in body fluid and tumour microenvironment. The present study aimed at characterization of whole types/subpopulations, but not only exosomes, of TMV from newly established gastric cancer cell line (called GC1415) and to define their interactions with autologous cells. METHODS: TMV were isolated from cell cultures supernatants by centrifugation at 50,000×g and their phenotype was determined by flow cytometry. The size of TMV was analysed by dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis, while morphology by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Interactions of TMV with cancer cells were visualized using fluorescence-activated cell sorter, confocal and atomic force microscopy, biological effects by xenografts in NOD SCID mice. RESULTS: Isolated TMV showed expression of CD44H, CD44v6 (hyaluronian receptors), CCR6 (chemokine receptor) and HER-2/neu molecules, exhibited different shapes and sizes (range 60-900 nm, highest frequency of particles with size range of 80-120 nm). TMV attached to autologous cancer cells within 2 h and then were internalized by them at 24 h. CD44H, CD44v6 and CCR6 molecules may play a role in attachment of TMV to cancer cells, while HER-2 associated with CD24 be involved in promoting cancer cells growth. Pre-exposure of cancer cells to TMV resulted in enhancement of tumour growth and cancer cell-induced angiogenesis in NOD SCID mice model. CONCLUSIONS: TMV interact directly with cancer cells serving as macro-messengers and molecular cargo transfer between gastric cancer cells resulting in enhancement of tumour growth. TMV should be considered in future as target of anticancer therapy.	PMC4666152

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	BACKGROUND: Exosomes have been implicated in tumour progression and metastatic spread. Little is known of the effect of mechanical and innate immune interactions of malignant cell-derived exosomes on endothelial integrity, which may relate to increased extravasation of circulating tumour cells and, therefore, increased metastatic spread. METHODS: Exosomes isolated from non-malignant immortalized HCV-29 and isogenic malignant non-metastatic T24 and malignant metastatic FL3 bladder cells were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis and quantitative nanomechanical mapping atomic force microscopy (QNM AFM) to determine size and nanomechanical properties. Effect of HCV-29, T24 and FL3 exosomes on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayer integrity was determined by transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements and transport was determined by flow cytometry. Complement activation studies in human serum of malignant and non-malignant cell-derived exosomes were performed. RESULTS: FL3, T24 and HCV-29 cells produced exosomes at similar concentration per cell (6.64, 6.61 and 6.46×10(4) exosomes per cell for FL3, T24 and HCV-29 cells, respectively) and of similar size (120.2 nm for FL3, 127.6 nm for T24 and 117.9 nm for HCV-29, respectively). T24 and FL3 cell-derived exosomes exhibited a markedly reduced stiffness, 95 MPa and 280 MPa, respectively, compared with 1,527 MPa with non-malignant HCV-29 cell-derived exosomes determined by QNM AFM. FL3 and T24 exosomes induced endothelial disruption as measured by a decrease in TEER in HUVEC monolayers, whereas no effect was observed for HCV-29 derived exosomes. FL3 and T24 exosomes traffic more readily (11.6 and 21.4% of applied exosomes, respectively) across HUVEC monolayers than HCV-29 derived exosomes (7.2% of applied exosomes). Malignant cell-derived exosomes activated complement through calcium-sensitive pathways in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant (metastatic and non-metastatic) cell line exosomes display a markedly reduced stiffness and adhesion but an increased complement activation compared to non-malignant cell line exosomes, which may explain the observed increased endothelial monolayer disruption and transendothelial transport of these vesicles.

Am J Physiol Renal Physiol	2016	Although nanosized urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are increasingly used for biomarker discovery, their isolation currently relies on time-consuming techniques hindering high-throughput application. To navigate this problem, we designed an immunoassay to isolate, quantify, and normalize uEV proteins. The uEV immunoassay consists of a biotinylated CD9 antibody to isolate uEVs, an antibody against the protein of interest, and two conjugated antibodies to quantify the protein of interest and CD9. As a proof of principle, the immunoassay was developed to analyze the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC). CD9 was used as a capture antibody because immunoprecipitation showed that anti-CD9 antibody, but not anti-CD63 antibody, isolated AQP2 and NCC. CD9 correlated strongly with urine creatinine, allowing CD9 to be used for normalization of spot urines. The uEV immunoassay detected AQP2 and NCC with high sensitivity, low coefficients of variance, and stability in dilution series. After water loading in healthy subjects, the uEV immunoassay detected decreases in AQP2 and NCC equally well as the traditional method using ultracentrifugation and immunoblot. The uEV immunoassay also reliably detected lower and higher AQP2 or NCC levels in uEVs from patients with pathological water or salt reabsorption, respectively. In summary, we report a novel approach to analyze uEVs that circumvents existing isolation and normalization issues, requires small volumes of urine, and detects anticipated changes in physiological responses and clinical disorders.

J Extracell Vesicles	2016	The surface protein composition of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is related to the originating cell and may play a role in vesicle function. Knowledge of the protein content of individual EVs is still limited because of the technical challenges to analyse small vesicles. Here, we introduce a novel multiplex bead-based platform to investigate up to 39 different surface markers in one sample. The combination of capture antibody beads with fluorescently labelled detection antibodies allows the analysis of EVs that carry surface markers recognized by both antibodies. This new method enables an easy screening of surface markers on populations of EVs. By combining different capture and detection antibodies, additional information on relative expression levels and potential vesicle subpopulations is gained. We also established a protocol to visualize individual EVs by stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. Thereby, markers on single EVs can be detected by fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. We used the multiplex platform and STED microscopy to show for the first time that NK cell-derived EVs and platelet-derived EVs are devoid of CD9 or CD81, respectively, and that EVs isolated from activated B cells comprise different EV subpopulations. We speculate that, according to our STED data, tetraspanins might not be homogenously distributed but may mostly appear as clusters on EV subpopulations. Finally, we demonstrate that EV mixtures can be separated by magnetic beads and analysed subsequently with the multiplex platform. Both the multiplex bead-based platform and STED microscopy revealed subpopulations of EVs that have been indistinguishable by most analysis tools used so far. We expect that an in-depth view on EV heterogeneity will contribute to our understanding of different EVs and functions.	PMC4762227

Int Immunopharmacol	2016	The microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small regulatory non-coding RNA that contributes to the activation of host-pathogen cross-talk during infection. In helminthes, miR-71 is highly conserved and it has recently been detected in nematode exosomes, as well as in the sera and/or fluids of infected humans and mice. However, the role of miR-71 during infection remains poorly characterized. Herein, we show that Ago1 and Ago4, which encode key components of the small RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), were up-regulated in murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells transfected by Echinococcus multilocularis miR-71 (emu-miR-71) mimics. Using a miRNA PCR array, none of the 84 miRNAs involved in inflammation or autoimmunity were significantly up- or down-regulated in the transfected cells (p>0.05). Although it did not influence IL-10 production by the treated cells (p>0.05), the mimics significantly repressed the production of NO 12 h after treatment with LPS and IFN-γ (p<0.01), identifying another potential mechanism whereby parasites can carefully regulate host levels of NO. These findings indicate that the release of parasite-derived miR-71 into hosts can affect the functions of macrophages, and possibly represents an exciting direction for studies of the interplay between parasites and hosts.

Cancer Lett	2016	Mutual communication between multiple myeloma (MM) cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) plays a pivotal role in supporting MM progression. In MM, MSC exhibit a different genomic profile and dysregulated cytokine secretion compared to normal MSC, however the mechanisms involved in these changes are not fully understood. Here, we examined the miRNA changes in human MSC after culture with conditioned medium of MM cells and found 19 dysregulated miRNAs, including upregulated miR-146a. Moreover, exosomes derived from MM cells contained miR-146a and could be transferred into MSC. After overexpressing miR-146a in MSC, secretion of several cytokines and chemokines including CXCL1, IL6, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, and CCL-5 was elevated, resulting in the enhancement of MM cell viability and migration. DAPT, an inhibitor of the endogenous Notch pathway, was able to abrogate the miR-146a-induced increase of cytokines in MSC, suggesting the involvement of the Notch pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrate a positive feedback loop between MM cells and MSC: MM cells promote the increase of miR146a in MSC which leads to more cytokine secretion, which in turn favors MM cell growth and migration.

Sci Rep	2016	An increasing body of literature is addressing the immuno-modulating functions of miRNAs which include paracrine signaling via exosome-mediated intercellular miRNA. In view of the recent evidence of intake and bioavailability of dietary miRNAs in humans and animals we explored the immuno-modulating capacity of plant derived miRNAs. Here we show that transfection of synthetic miRNAs or native miRNA-enriched fractions obtained from a wide range of plant species and organs modifies dendritic cells ability to respond to inflammatory agents by limiting T cell proliferation and consequently dampening inflammation. This immuno-modulatory effect appears associated with binding of plant miRNA on TLR3 with ensuing impairment of TRIF signaling. Similarly, in vivo, plant small RNAs reduce the onset of severity of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelities by limiting dendritic cell migration and dampening Th1 and Th17 responses in a Treg-independent manner. Our results indicate a potential for therapeutic use of plant miRNAs in the prevention of chronic-inflammation related diseases.	PMC4863160

Exosomes mediate hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission and NK-cell dysfunction.	Cell Mol Immunol	2017	Evidence suggests that exosomes can transfer genetic material between cells. However, their roles in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remain unclear. Here, we report that exosomes present in the sera of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients contained both HBV nucleic acids and HBV proteins, and transferred HBV to hepatocytes in an active manner. Notably, HBV nucleic acids were detected in natural killer (NK) cells from both CHB patients and healthy donors after exposure to HBV-positive exosomes. Through real-time fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3',-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfnate salt (DiD)-labeled exosomes were observed to interact with NK cells and to be taken up by NK cells, which was enhanced by transforming growth factor-β treatment. Furthermore, HBV-positive exosomes impaired NK-cell functions, including interferon (IFN)-γ production, cytolytic activity, NK-cell proliferation and survival, as well as the responsiveness of the cells to poly (I:C) stimulation. HBV infection suppressed the expression of pattern-recognition receptors, especially retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), on NK cells, resulting in the dampening of the nuclear factor κB(NF-κB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Our results highlight a previously unappreciated role of exosomes in HBV transmission and NK-cell dysfunction during CHB infection.	PMC5423088

J Thorac Oncol	2016	INTRODUCTION: Exosomes have been suggested as promising biomarkers in NSCLC because they contain proteins from their originating cells and are readily available in plasma. In this study, we explored the potential of exosome protein profiling in diagnosing lung cancers of all stages and various histological subtypes in patients. METHODS: Plasma was isolated from 581 patients (431 with lung cancer and 150 controls). The extracellular vesicle array was used to phenotype exosomes. The extracellular vesicle array contained 49 antibodies for capturing exosomes. Subsequently, a cocktail of biotin-conjugated CD9, CD81, and CD63 antibodies was used to detect and visualize captured exosomes. Multimarker models were made by combining two or more markers. The optimal multimarker model was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and random forests analysis. RESULTS: The markers CD151, CD171, and tetraspanin 8 were the strongest separators of patients with cancer of all histological subtypes versus patients without cancer (CD151: AUC = 0.68, p = 0.0002; CD171: AUC = 0.60, p = 0.0002; and TSPAN8: AUC = 0.60, p = 0.0002). The multimarker models with the largest AUC in the cohort of patients with all lung cancer histological subtypes and in the cohort of patients with adenocarcinoma only covered 10 markers (all cancer: AUC = 0.74 [95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.80]; adenocarcinoma only: AUC = 0.76 [95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.83]). In squamous cell cancer and SCLC, multimarker models did not exceed CD151 as an individual marker in separating patients with cancer from controls. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated exosome protein profiling to be a promising diagnostic tool in lung cancer independently of stage and histological subtype. Multimarker models could make a fair separation of patients, demonstrating the perspectives of exosome protein profiling as a biomarker.

BARHL2 Methylation Using Gastric Wash DNA or Gastric Juice Exosomal DNA is a Useful Marker For Early Detection of Gastric Cancer in an H. pylori-Independent Manner.	Clin Transl Gastroenterol	2016	OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study was to develop a methylation analysis pipeline by using gastric wash-derived DNA and/or gastric juice-derived exosomal DNA (exoDNA), and to evaluate its suitability for the early detection of gastric cancer (GC) in clinical settings. METHODS: We analyzed alterations of BarH-like 2 homeobox protein (BARHL2) in GC cell lines and tissues, as well as in DNA obtained from 128 gastric washes and 30 gastric juice-derived exosomes. GC cell lines were transfected with plasmids encoding BARHL2 and subjected to proliferation, colony formation, and gene expression analyses. RESULTS: High levels of BARHL2 methylation were detected in three of seven GC cell lines; consistent with this, these cell lines expressed low levels of BARHL2. Treatment of these cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored BARHL2 expression. Levels of BARHL2 methylation in 18 normal and 14 atrophic gastritis samples were low irrespective of Helicobacter pylori infection. High levels of BARHL2 methylation were observed in gastric wash-derived DNA obtained from early GC patients before endoscopic resection (ER), but methylation was significantly lower after curative ER. Analysis using gastric juice-derived exoDNA samples revealed that BARHL2 methylation yielded an area under the curve of 0.923 with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity with respect to discriminating GC patients from non-GC controls. BARHL2 nuclear immunoreactivity was found in all normal gastric epithelial cells and in cells from patients with gastritis and adenoma. In contrast, loss of BARHL2 expression was observed in the vast majority of the GC tissues. Finally, transfection of BARHL2 into MKN7 and MKN45 cell lines significantly inhibited their proliferation and ability to form colonies. CONCLUSIONS: Methylation analysis of BARHL2 using gastric wash-derived DNA and/or gastric juice-derived exoDNA could be useful for early detection of GC in clinical settings.	PMC5543484

FASEB J	2016	Efficient intercellular transfer of RNAs, proteins, and lipids as protected exosomal cargo has been demonstrated in the CNS, but distinct physiologic and pathologic roles have not been well defined for this pathway. The capacity to isolate immunochemically human plasma neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs), containing neuron-specific cargo, has permitted characterization of CNS-derived exosomes in living humans. Constituents of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ)42-generating system now are examined in 2 distinct sets of human neural cells by quantification in astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) and NDEs, enriched separately from plasmas of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and matched cognitively normal controls. ADE levels of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1), γ-secretase, soluble Aβ42, soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP)β, sAPPα, glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), P-T181-tau, and P-S396-tau were significantly (3- to 20-fold) higher than levels in NDEs for patients and controls. BACE-1 levels also were a mean of 7-fold higher in ADEs than in NDEs from cultured rat type-specific neural cells. Levels of BACE-1 and sAPPβ were significantly higher and of GDNF significantly lower in ADEs of patients with AD than in those of controls, but not significantly different in patients with FTD than in controls. Abundant proteins of the Aβ42 peptide-generating system in ADEs may sustain levels in neurons. ADE cargo proteins may be useful for studies of mechanisms of cellular interactions and effects of BACE-1 inhibitors in AD.-Goetzl, E. J., Mustapic, M., Kapogiannis, D., Eitan, E., Lobach, I.

Sci Signal	2016	Exosomes are paracrine regulators of the tumor microenvironment and contain complex cargo. We previously reported that exosomes released from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells can suppress residual hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) function indirectly through stromal reprogramming of niche retention factors. We found that the systemic loss of hematopoietic function is also in part a consequence of AML exosome-directed microRNA (miRNA) trafficking to HSPCs. Exosomes isolated from cultured AML or the plasma from mice bearing AML xenografts exhibited enrichment of miR-150 and miR-155. HSPCs cocultured with either of these exosomes exhibited impaired clonogenicity, through the miR-150- and miR-155-mediated suppression of the translation of transcripts encoding c-MYB, a transcription factor involved in HSPC differentiation and proliferation. To discover additional miRNA targets, we captured miR-155 and its target transcripts by coimmunoprecipitation with an attenuated RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-trap, followed by high-throughput sequencing. This approach identified known and previously unknown miR-155 target transcripts. Integration of the miR-155 targets with information from the protein interaction database STRING revealed proteins indirectly affected by AML exosome-derived miRNA. Our findings indicate a direct effect of AML exosomes on HSPCs that, through a stroma-independent mechanism, compromises hematopoiesis. Furthermore, combining miRNA target data with protein-protein interaction data may be a broadly applicable strategy to define the effects of exosome-mediated trafficking of regulatory molecules within the tumor microenvironment.

Cell Transplant	2017	We previously demonstrated that multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) that overexpress microRNA 133b (miR-133b) significantly improve functional recovery in rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) compared with naive MSCs and that exosomes generated from naive MSCs mediate the therapeutic benefits of MSC therapy for stroke. Here we investigated whether exosomes isolated from miR-133b-overexpressing MSCs (Ex-miR-133b+) exert amplified therapeutic effects. Rats subjected to 2 h of MCAO were intra-arterially injected with Ex-miR-133b+, exosomes from MSCs infected by blank vector (Ex-Con), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were sacrificed 28 days after MCAO. Compared with the PBS treatment, both exosome treatment groups exhibited significant improvement of functional recovery. Ex-miR-133b+ treatment significantly increased functional improvement and neurite remodeling/brain plasticity in the ischemic boundary area compared with the Ex-Con treatment. Treatment with Ex-miR-133b+ also significantly increased brain exosome content compared with Ex-Con treatment. To elucidate mechanisms underlying the enhanced therapeutic effects of Ex-miR-133b+, astrocytes cultured under oxygen- and glucose-deprived (OGD) conditions were incubated with exosomes harvested from naive MSCs (Ex-Naive), miR-133b downregulated MSCs (Ex-miR-133b-), and Ex-miR-133b+. Compared with the Ex-Naive treatment, Ex-miR-133b+ significantly increased exosomes released by OGD astrocytes, whereas Ex-miR-133b- significantly decreased the release. Also, exosomes harvested from OGD astrocytes treated with Ex-miR-133b+ significantly increased neurite branching and elongation of cultured cortical embryonic rat neurons compared with the exosomes from OGD astrocytes subjected to Ex-Con. Our data suggest that exosomes harvested from miR-133b-overexpressing MSCs improve neural plasticity and functional recovery after stroke with a contribution from a stimulated secondary release of neurite-promoting exosomes from astrocytes.

J Am Heart Assoc	2016	BACKGROUND: A new mechanism for intercellular communication has recently emerged that involves intercellular transfer of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Several studies have indicated that EVs may play a potential role in cell-to-cell communication between macrophage foam cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in atherosclerotic lesion. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study involved the comparison of circulating EVs from atherosclerotic patients and control participants. The results showed that the circulation of the patients contained more leukocyte-derived EVs and that these EVs promoted more VSMC adhesion and migration than those of healthy participants. We then established a macrophage foam cell model and characterized the EVs from the macrophages. We used flow cytometric analyses and cell migration and adhesion assays and determined that the foam cells generated more EVs than the normal macrophages and that the foam cell-derived EVs were capable of promoting increased levels of VSMC migration and adhesion. Furthermore, we performed a proteomic analysis of the EVs. The data showed that the foam cell-derived EVs may promote VSMC adhesion and migration by regulating the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion pathways. In addition, Western blotting revealed that foam cell-derived EVs could promote the phosphorylation of ERK and Akt in VSMCs in a time-dependent manner. We also found that foam cell-derived EVs could enter the VSMCs and transfer integrins to the surface of these cells. CONCLUSIONS: The data in our present study provide the first evidence that EVs from foam cells could promote VSMC migration and adhesion, which may be mediated by the integration of EVs into VSMCs and the subsequent downstream activation of ERK and Akt.

AAPS J	2017	Although small interfering RNA (siRNA) holds great therapeutic promise, its delivery to the disease site remains a paramount obstacle. In this study, we tested whether brain endothelial cell-derived exosomes could deliver siRNA across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in zebrafish. Natural exosomes were isolated from brain endothelial bEND.3 cell culture media and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) siRNA was loaded in exosomes with the assistance of a transfection reagent. While fluorescence-activated cell flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry staining studies indicated that wild-type exosomes significantly increased the uptake of fluorescence-labeled siRNA in the autologous brain endothelial cells, decreased fluorescence intensity was observed in the cells treated with the tetraspanin CD63 antibody-blocked exosome-delivered formulation (p < 0.05). In the transport study, exosomes also enhanced the permeability of rhodamine 123 in a co-cultured monolayer of brain endothelial bEND.3 cell and astrocyte. Inhibition at the expression of VEGF RNA and protein levels was observed in glioblastoma-astrocytoma U-87 MG cells treated with exosome-delivered siRNAs. Imaging results showed that exosome delivered more siRNAs across the BBB in Tg(fli1:GFP) zebrafish. In a xenotransplanted brain tumor model, exosome-delivered VEGF siRNAs decreased the fluorescence intensity of labeled cancer cells in the brain of zebrafish. Brain endothelial cell-derived exosomes could be potentially used as a natural carrier for the brain delivery of exogenous siRNA.

Nanomedicine	2017	In cancer, extracellular vesicles (EV) contribute to tumor progression by regulating local and systemic effects. Being released into body fluids, EV may be used in nanomedicine as a valuable source for diagnostic biomarkers. In this work, infrared and Raman spectroscopy were used for comprehensive comparative analysis of cancer versus non-cancer EV and patient screening. Two different EV fractions enriched in exosomes and microvesicles were isolated by differential centrifugation from serum and plasma of cancer and non-cancer patients and from serum and plasma of a healthy donor. The EV fractions were then subjected to drop-coating deposition and drying on calcium fluoride substrates. Reduction of alpha-helix-rich proteins and enhancement of beta-sheet-rich proteins as a cancer-specific blood EV signature was determined, and subsequently this feature was applied for a pilot study aiming to detect prostate cancer in a test cohort of patients with high-grade prostate carcinoma and benign hypoplasia.

Stem Cell Rev	2017	Several studies have suggested that extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may mediate MSC paracrine action on kidney regeneration. This activity has been, at least in part, ascribed to the transfer of proteins/transcription factors and different RNA species. Information on the RNA/protein content of different MSC EV subpopulations and the correlation with their biological activity is currently incomplete. The aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular composition and the functional properties on renal target cells of MSC EV sub-populations separated by gradient floatation. The results demonstrated heterogeneity in quantity and composition of MSC EVs. Two peaks of diameter were observed (90-110 and 170-190 nm). The distribution of exosomal markers and miRNAs evaluated in the twelve gradient fractions showed an enrichment in fractions with a flotation density of 1.08-1.14 g/mL. Based on this observation, we evaluated the biological activity on renal cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance of low (CF1), medium (CF2) and high (CF3) floatation density fractions. EVs derived from all fractions, were internalized by renal cells, CF1 and CF2 but not CF3 fraction stimulated significant cell proliferation. CF2 also inhibited apoptosis on renal tubular cells submitted to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Comparative miRNomic and proteomic profiles reveal a cluster of miRNAs and proteins common to all three fractions and an enrichment of selected molecules related to renal regeneration in CF2 fraction. In conclusion, the CF2 fraction enriched in exosomal markers was the most active on renal tubular cell proliferation and protection from apoptosis.	PMC5380712

Mol Ther	2017	Inflammation plays an important role in cardiac injuries. Here, we examined the role of miRNA in regulating inflammation and cardiac injury during myocardial infarction. We showed that mir-155 expression was increased in the mouse heart after myocardial infarction. Upregulated mir-155 was primarily presented in macrophages and cardiac fibroblasts of injured hearts, while pri-mir-155 was only expressed in macrophages. mir-155 was also presented in exosomes derived from macrophages, and it can be transferred into cardiac fibroblasts by macrophage-derived exosomes. A mir-155 mimic or mir-155 containing exosomes inhibited cardiac fibroblast proliferation by downregulating Son of Sevenless 1 expression and promoted inflammation by decreasing Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 expression. These effects were reversed by the addition of a mir-155 inhibitor. In vivo, mir-155-deficient mice showed a significant reduction of the incidence of cardiac rupture and an improved cardiac function compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, transfusion of wild-type macrophage exosomes to mir-155-/- mice exacerbated cardiac rupture. Finally, the mir-155-deficient mice exhibited elevated fibroblast proliferation and collagen production, along with reduced cardiac inflammation in injured heart. Taken together, our results demonstrate that activated macrophages secrete mir-155-enriched exosomes and identify macrophage-derived mir-155 as a paracrine regulator for fibroblast proliferation and inflammation; thus, a mir-155 inhibitor (i.e., mir-155 antagomir) has the potential to be a therapeutic agent for reducing acute myocardial-infarction-related adverse events.

Plasma Exosomes Spread and Cluster Around β-Amyloid Plaques in an Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.	Front Aging Neurosci	2017	Exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicle, have been shown to be involved in many disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exosomes may contribute to the spread of misfolded proteins such as amyloid-β (Aβ) and α-synuclein. However, the specific diffusion process of exosomes and their final destination in brain are still unclear. In the present study, we isolated exosomes from peripheral plasma and injected them into the hippocampus of an AD mouse model, and investigated exosome diffusion. We found that injected exosomes can spread from the dentate gyrus (DG) to other regions of hippocampus and to the cortex. Exosomes targeted microglia preferentially; this phenomenon is stable and is not affected by age. In AD mice, microglia take up lower levels of exosomes. More interestingly, plasma exosomes cluster around the Aβ plaques and are engulfed by activated microglia nearby. Our data indicate that exosomes can diffuse throughout the brain and may play a role in the dynamics of amyloid deposition in AD through microglia.	PMC5285341

Vet Parasitol	2017	Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a chronic and complex zoonotic disease. Information on the mechanisms involved in parasite establishment, growth and persistence remain limited. These may be modulated by a crosstalk between extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs including exosomes and microvesicles are able to carry developmental signaling proteins which coordinate growth and establishment of several parasites. Here, an exosome enriched EV fraction was isolated from hydatid fluid (HF) of fertile sheep cysts. A proteomic analysis of this fraction identified a number of parasite-derived vesicle-membrane associated proteins as well as cytosolic proteins. Additionally, the exosomal enriched fraction contained proteins of host origin. Specific proteins -antigen B2 and TSPAN14- in the exosomal fraction were further assayed by immunoblot and transmission electron microscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence of parasite exosomes in fertile hydatid cyst fluid. Further characterization of the exosome cargo will allow the discovery of new markers for the detection of CE in humans and animals, and the treatment of CE patients, and provide new insights regarding the role of these EVs in the establishment and persistence of hydatid cysts.

Electronic address: .	f.stassen@maastrichtuniversity.nl		Cigarette smoke extract induced exosome release is mediated by depletion of exofacial thiols and can be inhibited by thiol-antioxidants.	Free Radic Biol Med	2017	INTRODUCTION: Airway epithelial cells have been described to release extracellular vesicles (EVs) with pathological properties when exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). As CSE causes oxidative stress, we investigated whether its oxidative components are responsible for inducing EV release and whether this could be prevented using the thiol antioxidants N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) or glutathione (GSH). METHODS: BEAS-2B cells were exposed for 24h to CSE, H2O2, acrolein, 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), bacitracin, rutin or the anti-protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) antibody clone RL90; with or without NAC or GSH. EVs in media were measured using CD63+CD81+ bead-coupled flow cytometry or tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS). For characterization by Western Blotting, cryo-transmission electron microscopy and TRPS, EVs were isolated using ultracentrifugation. Glutathione disulfide and GSH in cells were assessed by a GSH reductase cycling assay, and exofacial thiols using Flow cytometry. RESULTS: CSE augmented the release of the EV subtype exosomes, which could be prevented by scavenging thiol-reactive components using NAC or GSH. Among thiol-reactive CSE components, H2O2 had no effect on exosome release, whereas acrolein imitated the NAC-reversible exosome induction. The exosome induction by CSE and acrolein was paralleled by depletion of cell surface thiols. Membrane impermeable thiol blocking agents, but not specific inhibitors of the exofacially located thiol-dependent enzyme PDI, stimulated exosome release. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION: Thiol-reactive compounds like acrolein account for CSE-induced exosome release by reacting with cell surface thiols. As acrolein is produced endogenously during inflammation, it may influence exosome release not only in smokers, but also in ex-smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. NAC and GSH prevent acrolein- and CSE-induced exosome release, which may contribute to the clinical benefits of NAC treatment.

Circulation	2017	BACKGROUND: Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) confer cardioprotection in acute myocardial infarction by distinctive macrophage (Mϕ) polarization. Here we demonstrate that CDC-secreted exosomes (CDCexo) recapitulate the cardioprotective effects of CDC therapy known as cellular postconditioning. METHODS: Rats and pigs underwent myocardial infarction induced by ischemia/reperfusion before intracoronary infusion of CDCexo, inert fibroblast exosomes (Fbexo; control), or vehicle. Two days later, infarct size was quantified. Macrophages were isolated from cardiac tissue or bone marrow for downstream analyses. RNA sequencing was used to determine exosome content and alterations in gene expression profiles in Mϕ. RESULTS: Administration of CDCexo but not Fbexo after reperfusion reduces infarct size in rat and pig models of myocardial infarction. Furthermore, CDCexo reduce the number of CD68+ Mϕ within infarcted tissue and modify the polarization state of Mϕ so as to mimic that induced by CDCs. CDCexo are enriched in several miRNAs (including miR-146a, miR-181b, and miR-126) relative to Fbexo. Reverse pathway analysis of whole-transcriptome data from CDCexo-primed Mϕ implicated miR-181b as a significant (P=1.3x10-21) candidate mediator of CDC-induced Mϕ polarization, and PKCδ (protein kinase C δ) as a downstream target. Otherwise inert Fbexo loaded selectively with miR-181b alter Mϕ phenotype and confer cardioprotective efficacy in a rat model of myocardial infarction. Adoptive transfer of PKCδ-suppressed Mϕ recapitulates cardioprotection. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that exosomal transfer of miR-181b from CDCs into Mϕ reduces PKCδ transcript levels and underlies the cardioprotective effects of CDCs administered after reperfusion.

Electronic address: .	dino.tan@uwa.edu.au		Elevated levels of circulating exosome in COPD patients are associated with systemic inflammation.	Respir Med	2017	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by progressive pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are associated with acute inflammation and infections and increase the rates of morbidity and mortality. Currently, neither the aetiology nor pathogenesis of AECOPD are entirely understood. Exosomes have been reported to regulate immunity and inflammation via specific intercellular communications through an array of macromolecules (e.g. microRNA and proteins) contained within these microvesicles. We evaluated the level of circulating exosomes in relation to systemic inflammation in patients with AECOPD (n = 20) or stable COPD (sCOPD; n = 20) in comparison to non-smoking healthy controls (n = 20). Exosomes in plasma were isolated by precipitation-based method, and quantified using a CD9 expression based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Plasma biomarkers of systemic inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNFR1) and interleukin (IL)-6 were also quantified using ELISA. Levels of plasma exosome were higher in AECOPD patients (p < 0.001) and sCOPD patients (p < 0.05) compared to controls. Plasma levels of CRP and sTNFR1 were highest in AECOPD, followed by sCOPD patients compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Plasma IL-6 was elevated in AECOPD (p < 0.05) and sCOPD patients (p < 0.01) compared to controls. The level of exosome correlated with the levels of CRP, sTNFR1 and IL-6 in plasma. Exosomes may therefore be involved in the inflammatory process of AECOPD. Further studies involving exosomal phenotyping and molecular characterization are required to fully understand their role in the pathophysiology of COPD.

Med Hypotheses	2017	Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder with lifelong morbidity and increased mortality. Currently, the diagnosis of the disorder is based on patient history and clinical examination, but it has a low inter-rater reliability and validity. Various biological variables, such as event related potentials, hormonal levels, brain ventricular volume and hippocampal size, have been put forth as objective markers to diagnose schizophrenia, but none with the desired sensitivity and specificity. It has been shown that microRNAs play a vital role in gene regulation in schizophrenia and have been proposed as possible biomarkers for the disease. When compared to the free microRNAs in the body fluids, exosomal microRNAs are more resistant to degradation and are easier to isolate. There are no studies reporting exosomal microRNAs as biomarkers for schizophrenia, but we hypothesize that exosomal microRNAs will be found to be potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis assessment and medication response to patients with this disease.

MicroRNA-containing extracellular vesicles released from endothelial colony-forming cells modulate angiogenesis during ischaemic retinopathy.	J Cell Mol Med	2017	Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) are a defined subtype of endothelial progenitors that modulate vascular repair and promote perfusion in ischaemic tissues. Their paracrine activity on resident vasculature is ill-defined, but mediated, at least in part, by the transfer of extracellular vesicles (EVs). To evaluate the potential of isolated EVs to provide an alternative to cell-based therapies, we first performed a physical and molecular characterization of those released by ECFCs. Their effects upon endothelial cells in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo in a model of proliferative retinopathy were assessed. The EVs expressed typical markers CD9 and CD63 and formed a heterogeneous population ranging in size from ~60 to 1500 nm by electron microscopy. ECFC EVs were taken up by endothelial cells and increased cell migration. This was reflected by microarray analyses which showed significant changes in expression of genes associated with angiogenesis. Sequencing of small RNAs in ECFCs and their EVs showed that multiple microRNAs are highly expressed and concentrated in EVs. The functional categories significantly enriched for the predicted target genes of these microRNAs included angiogenesis. Intravitreally delivered ECFC EVs were associated with the vasculature and significantly reduced the avascular area in a mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy model. Our findings confirm the potential of isolated EVs to influence endothelial cell function and act as a therapy to modulate angiogenesis. The functions associated with the specific microRNAs detected in ECFC EVs support a role for microRNA transfer in mediating the observed effects.	PMC5706503

Efficacy of vaccination with tumor-exosome loaded dendritic cells combined with cytotoxic drug treatment in pancreatic cancer.	Oncoimmunology	2017	Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) has a dismal prognosis and adjuvant immunotherapy frequently is of low efficacy due to immunosuppressive features of PaCa and PaCa-stroma. We here explored, whether the efficacy of vaccination with tumor-exosome (TEX)-loaded dendritic cells (DC) can be improved by combining with drugs affecting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Experiments were performed with the UNKC6141 PaCa line. UNKC6141 TEX-loaded DC were weekly intravenously injected, mice additionally receiving Gemcitabine (GEM) and/or ATRA and/or Sunitinib (Sun). UNKC6141 grow aggressively after subcutaneous and orthotopic application and are consistently recovered in peripheral blood, bone marrow, lung and frequently liver. Vaccination with DC-TEX significantly prolonged the survival time, the efficacy of DC-TEX exceeding that of the cytotoxic drugs. However, ATRA, Sun and most efficiently GEM, sufficed for a pronounced reduction of MDSC including tumor-infiltrating MDSC, which was accompanied by a decrease in migrating and metastasizing tumor cells. When combined with DC-TEX vaccination, a higher number of activated T cells was recovered in the tumor and the survival time was prolonged compared with only DC-TEX vaccinated mice. As ATRA, GEM and Sun affect MDSC at distinct maturation and activation stages, a stronger support for DC-TEX vaccination was expected by the drug combination. Intrapancreatic tumor growth was prevented beyond the death of control mice. However, tumors developed after a partial breakdown of the immune system by the persisting drug application. Nonetheless, in combination with optimized drug tuning to prevent MDSC maturation and activation, vaccination with TEX-loaded DC appears a most promising option in PaCa therapy.	PMC5486185

Role of TIM-4 in exosome-dependent entry of HIV-1 into human immune cells.	Int J Nanomedicine	2017	Exosomes, 30-200 nm nanostructures secreted from donor cells and internalized by recipient cells, can play an important role in the cellular entry of some viruses. These microvesicles are actively secreted into various body fluids, including blood, urine, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, and breast milk. We successfully isolated exosomes from human breast milk and plasma. The size and concentration of purified exosomes were measured by nanoparticle tracking, while Western blotting confirmed the presence of the exosomal-associated proteins CD9 and CD63, clathrin, and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin proteins (TIMs). Through viral infection assays, we determined that HIV-1 utilizes an exosome-dependent mechanism for entry into human immune cells. The virus contains high amounts of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and may bind PtdSer receptors, such as TIMs. This mechanism is supported by our findings that exosomes from multiple sources increased HIV-1 entry into T cells and macrophages, and viral entry was potently blocked with anti-TIM-4 antibodies.

Effects of storage temperature on airway exosome integrity for diagnostic and functional analyses.	J Extracell Vesicles	2017	Background: Extracellular vesicles contain biological molecules specified by cell-type of origin and modified by microenvironmental changes. To conduct reproducible studies on exosome content and function, storage conditions need to have minimal impact on airway exosome integrity. Aim: We compared surface properties and protein content of airway exosomes that had been freshly isolated vs. those that had been treated with cold storage or freezing. Methods: Mouse bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) exosomes purified by differential ultracentrifugation were analysed immediately or stored at +4°C or -80°C. Exosomal structure was assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and charge density (zeta potential, ζ). Exosomal protein content, including leaking/dissociating proteins, were identified by label-free LC-MS/MS. Results: Freshly isolated BALF exosomes exhibited a mean diameter of 95 nm and characteristic morphology. Storage had significant impact on BALF exosome size and content. Compared to fresh, exosomes stored at +4°C had a 10% increase in diameter, redistribution to polydisperse aggregates and reduced ζ. Storage at -80°C produced an even greater effect, resulting in a 25% increase in diameter, significantly reducing the ζ, resulting in multilamellar structure formation. In fresh exosomes, we identified 1140 high-confidence proteins enriched in 19 genome ontology biological processes. After storage at room temperature, 848 proteins were identified. In preparations stored at +4°C, 224 proteins appeared in the supernatant fraction compared to the wash fractions from freshly prepared exosomes; these proteins represent exosome leakage or dissociation of loosely bound "peri-exosomal" proteins. In preparations stored at -80°C, 194 proteins appeared in the supernatant fraction, suggesting that distinct protein groups leak from exosomes at different storage temperatures. Conclusions: Storage destabilizes the surface characteristics, morphological features and protein content of BALF exosomes. For preservation of the exosome protein content and representative functional analysis, airway exosomes should be analysed immediately after isolation.	PMC5556670

J Exp Clin Cancer Res	2017	BACKGROUND: Horizontal transfer of malignant traits from the primary tumor to distant organs, through blood circulating factors, has recently become a thoroughly studied metastatic pathway to explain cancer dissemination. Recently, we reported that oncosuppressor gene-mutated human cells undergo malignant transformation when exposed to cancer patients' sera. We also observed that oncosuppressor mutated cells would show an increased uptake of cancer-derived exosomes and we suggested that oncosuppressor genes might protect the integrity of the cell genome by blocking integration of cancer-derived exosomes. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that cancer patients' sera-derived exosomes might be responsible for the malignant transformation of target cells and that oncosuppressor mutation would promote their increased uptake. We also sought to unveil the mechanisms behind the hypothesized phenomena. METHODS: We used human BRCA1 knockout (BRCA1-KO) fibroblasts as target cells. Cells were treated in vitro with cancer patients' sera or cancer patients' sera-derived exosomes. Treated cells were injected into NOD-SCID mice. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to determine the differentiation state of the xenotransplants. Mass spectrometry analyses of proteins from cancer exosomes and the BRCA1-KO fibroblasts' membrane were performed to investigate possible de novo expression of molecules involved in vesicles uptake. Blocking of the identified molecules in vitro was performed and in vivo experiments were conducted to confirm the role of these molecules in the malignant transformation carried out by cancer-derived exosomes. RESULTS: Cells treated with exosomes isolated from cancer patients' sera underwent malignant transformation and formed tumors when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. Histological analyses showed that the tumors were carcinomas that differentiated into the same lineage of the primary tumors of blood donors. Oncosuppressor mutation promoted the de novo expression, on the plasma membrane of target cells, of receptors, responsible for the increased uptake of cancer-derived exosomes. The selective blocking of these receptors inhibited the horizontal transfer of malignant traits. CONCLUSION: These findings strengthen the hypothesis that oncogenic factors transferred via circulating cancer exosomes, induce malignant transformation of target cells even at distance. Oncosuppressor genes might protect the integrity of the cell genome by inhibiting the uptake of cancer-derived exosomes.	PMC5577828

Exosome-mediated miR-146a transfer suppresses type I interferon response and facilitates EV71 infection.	PLoS Pathog	2017	Exosomes can transfer genetic materials between cells. Their roles in viral infections are beginning to be appreciated. Researches have shown that exosomes released from virus-infected cells contain a variety of viral and host cellular factors that are able to modulate recipient's cellular response and result in productive infection of the recipient host. Here, we showed that EV71 infection resulted in upregulated exosome secretion and differential packaging of the viral genomic RNA and miR-146a into exosomes. We provided evidence showing that miR-146a was preferentially enriched in exosomes while the viral RNA was not in infected cells. Moreover, the exosomes contained replication-competent EV71 RNA in complex with miR-146a, Ago2, and GW182 and could mediate EV71 transmission independent of virus-specific receptor. The exosomal viral RNA could be transferred to and replicate in a new target cell while the exosomal miR-146a suppressed type I interferon response in the target cell, thus facilitating the viral replication. Additionally, we found that the IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGs), BST-2/tetherin, were involved in regulating EV71-induced upregulation of exosome secretion. Importantly, in vivo study showed that exosomal viral RNA exhibited differential tissue accumulation as compared to the free virus particles. Together, our findings provide evidence that exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells selectively packaged high level miR-146a that can be functionally transferred to and facilitate exosomal EV71 RNA to replicate in the recipient cells by suppressing type I interferon response.

Sci Rep	2017	Radiation is a highly efficient therapy in squamous head and neck carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment. However, local recurrence and metastasis are common complications. Recent evidence shows that cancer-cell-derived exosomes modify tumour cell movement and metastasis. In this study, we link radiation-induced changes of exosomes to their ability to promote migration of recipient HNSCC cells. We demonstrate that exosomes isolated from irradiated donor cells boost the motility of the HNSCC cells BHY and FaDu. Molecular data identified enhanced AKT-signalling, manifested through increased phospho-mTOR, phospho-rpS6 and MMP2/9 protease activity, as underlying mechanism. AKT-inhibition blocked the pro-migratory action, suggesting AKT-signalling as key player in exosome-mediated migration. Proteomic analysis of exosomes isolated from irradiated and non-irradiated BHY donor cells identified 39 up- and 36 downregulated proteins. In line with the observed pro-migratory effect of exosomes isolated from irradiated cells protein function analysis assigned the deregulated exosomal proteins to cell motility and AKT-signalling. Together, our findings demonstrate that exosomes derived from irradiated HNSCC cells confer a migratory phenotype to recipient cancer cells. This is possibly due to radiation-regulated exosomal proteins that increase AKT-signalling. We conclude that exosomes may act as driver of HNSCC progression during radiotherapy and are therefore attractive targets to improve radiation therapy strategies.	PMC5622080

Nat Commun	2017	Recent evidence suggests that the ion channel TRPA1 is implicated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where its role and mechanism of action remain unknown. We have previously established that the membrane receptor FGFR2 drives LUAD progression through aberrant protein-protein interactions mediated via its C-terminal proline-rich motif. Here we report that the N-terminal ankyrin repeats of TRPA1 directly bind to the C-terminal proline-rich motif of FGFR2 inducing the constitutive activation of the receptor, thereby prompting LUAD progression and metastasis. Furthermore, we show that upon metastasis to the brain, TRPA1 gets depleted, an effect triggered by the transfer of TRPA1-targeting exosomal microRNA (miRNA-142-3p) from brain astrocytes to cancer cells. This downregulation, in turn, inhibits TRPA1-mediated activation of FGFR2, hindering the metastatic process. Our study reveals a direct binding event and characterizes the role of TRPA1 ankyrin repeats in regulating FGFR2-driven oncogenic process; a mechanism that is hindered by miRNA-142-3p.TRPA1 has been reported to contribute lung cancer adenocarcinoma (LUAD), but the mechanisms are unclear. Here the authors propose that TRPA1/FGFR2 interaction is functional in LUAD and show that astrocytes oppose brain metastasis by mediating the downregulation of TRPA1 through exosome-delivered miRNA-142-3p.

Exosomal miR-7 Mediates Bystander Autophagy in Lung after Focal Brain Irradiation in Mice.	Int J Biol Sci	2017	This study investigated whether exosomal microRNA-7 (miR-7) mediates lung bystander autophagy after focal brain irradiation in mice. After 10 Gy or sham irradiation of mice brains, lung tissues were extracted for the detection of autophagy markers by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), meanwhile the brains were dissociated, the neuron/astrocyte/microglia/oligodendrocyte were isolated, and the miR-7 expression in each population were detected, respectively. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was developed to identify whether Bcl-2 is a target gene of miR-7. After 10 Gy or sham irradiation of astrocytes, exosomes were extracted, stained with Dil (1,1'-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-Tetramethylindocarbocyanine Perchlorate), and added into non-irradiated astrocytes. Meanwhile, Dil-stained exosomes released from 10 Gy or sham irradiated astrocytes were injected into LC3B-GFP mice via the tail vein. Lung tissues were then extracted for western blotting and qRT-PCR. Irradiation of mouse brains increased the LC3B-II/I ratio, Beclin-1 and miR-7 levels, while decreased the Bcl-2 level in non-irradiated lung tissue. Interestingly, brain irradiation remarkably increased the miR-7 expression in astrocyte and oligodendrocyte. MiR-7 significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of the wild-type Bcl-2-3'-untranslated regions (UTR) reporter vector, but not that of the Bcl-2-3'-UTR mutant vector, indicating that Bcl-2 is directly targeted by miR-7. In in vitro study, the addition of irradiated astrocyte-secreted exosomes increased the LC3B-II/I ratio, Beclin-1 and miR-7 levels, while decreased the Bcl-2 level in non-irradiated astrocytes. Further, the injection of irradiated astrocyte-secreted exosomes through the tail vein increased the lung LC3B-II/I ratio, Beclin-1 and miR-7 level, but decreased the Bcl-2 level in vivo. We concluded that exosomal miR-7 targets Bcl-2 to mediate distant bystander autophagy in the lungs after brain irradiation.	PMC5666527

Electronic address: .	huahan@fmmu.edu.cn		Exosomes derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells promote neural stem cell expansion while maintain their stemness in culture.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2018	The neural stem cell (NSC) niche in subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult mammalian brain contains dense vascular plexus, where endothelial cells (ECs) regulate NSCs by releasing plenty of angiocrine factors. However, the role of ECs-derived exosomes, a novel type of mediators of intercellular communications, in the regulation of NSCs remains unclear. In the current study, primary NSCs isolated from embryonic mouse brains form more neurospheres when cultured in the presence of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The supportive role of ECs in the coculture was significantly attenuated when GW4869, a blocker of exosome formation, was included, suggesting that HUVECs-derived exosomes played a significant role in supporting NSCs. In order to investigate the role of ECs-derived exosomes on NSCs, we collected exosomes from HUVECs. We found that HUVECs-derived exosomes could significantly promote the formation of neurospheres by primary murine NSCs. EdU incorporation and TUNEL assays indicated that the proliferation of NSCs increased while apoptosis decreased when cultured in the presence of HUVECs-derived exosomes. NSCs incubated with the HUVECs-derived exosomes maintained their potential of multi-lineage differentiation potentials. The expression of stemness-related genes was up-regulated. These data suggested that ECs-derived exosomes could play an importantly role in NSC niche, and they might be used as a reagent for ex vivo NSC amplification for medical application.

The effect of tumor-derived exosomes on immune regulation and cancer immunotherapy.	Future Oncol	2017	Tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) carry both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory receptor/ligands that in part mimic the profiles of the parent tumor cells. Operating as an intercellular communication system, TEX deliver protumor or antitumor signals to immune and nonimmune cells reprogramming their functions. Mechanisms responsible for cellular reprogramming include cell surface signaling and/or uptake of TEX by recipient cells. Once internalized, TEX transfer mRNA, miRNA and proteins that promote transcriptional/translational activities. TEX-mediated signaling is contextual and, in the tumor microenvironment, TEX largely mediate suppression. TEX may interfere with immune therapies either by sequestration of therapeutic antibodies or elimination of vaccine-induced or adoptively-transferred immune effector cells. TEX are emerging as an ubiquitous subcellular system regulating immune responses in patients with cancer.	PMC5827821

Placenta	2018	INTRODUCTION: Cultured primary human trophoblasts (PHT), derived from term placentas, are relatively resistant to infection by diverse viruses. The resistance can be conferred to non-trophoblastic cells by pre-exposing them to medium that was conditioned by PHT cells. This antiviral effect is mediated, at least in part, by microRNAs (miRNA) expressed from the chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC). Recently we showed that PHT cells and cells pre-exposed to PHT medium are also resistant to infection by Zika virus (ZIKV), an effect mediated by the constitutive release of the type III interferons (IFN) IFN lambda-1 and IFN lambda-2 in trophoblastic medium. We hypothesized that trophoblastic C19MC miRNA are active against ZIKV, and assessed the interaction of this pathway with IFN lambda-1 - mediated resistance. METHODS: Term PHT cells were cultured using standard techniques. An osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS) was used as non-trophoblastic cells, which were infected with either ZIKV or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Trophoblastic extracellular vesicles (EVs) were produced by gradient ultracentrifugation. RT-qPCR was used to determine viral infection, cellular or medium miRNA levels and the expression of interferon-stimulated genes. RESULTS: We showed that C19MC miRNA attenuate infection of U2OS cells by ZIKV, and that C19MC miRNA or exosomes that contain C19MC miRNA did not influence the type III IFN pathway. Similarly, cell exposure to recombinant IFN lambda-1 had no effect on miRNA expression, and these pathways did not exhibit synergistic interaction. DISCUSSION: PHT cells exert antiviral activity by at least two independent mechanisms, mediated by C19MC miRNA and by type III IFNs.	PMC5745809

Exosomes expressing the self-antigens myosin and vimentin play an important role in syngeneic cardiac transplant rejection induced by antibodies to cardiac myosin.	Am J Transplant	2018	Long-term success of heart transplantation is hindered by humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. We studied preexisting antibodies to cardiac self-antigens, myosin and vimentin, and exosomes induced by antibodies to self-antigens in eliciting immune responses to cardiac grafts. After syngeneic heterotopic murine heart transplantation, rabbit anti-myosin or normal rabbit immunoglobulin was administered at day 0 or 7. Sera were collected after heartbeat cessation, cellular infiltration was analyzed, and exosomes were isolated from sera. Histopathologic examination of the controls' transplanted hearts demonstrated normal architecture, and their sera demonstrated neither antibodies to self-antigens nor exosomes expressing self-antigens. Administration of antibodies to cardiac myosin immediately posttransplantation (day 0) but not on day 7 triggered graft failure on day 7, and histopathologic examination revealed marked cellular infiltration with neutrophils and lymphocytes. Histopathologic examination of rejected hearts also demonstrated myocyte damage as sera had increased antibodies to myosin and vimentin and development of exosomes expressing self-antigens. Administration of exosomes isolated from failed grafts containing self-antigens induced graft dysfunction; exosomes isolated from stable mice did not induce graft failure. Antibodies to self-antigens can induce exosomes containing self-antigens, initiating an immune response and causing graft failure after cardiac transplantation.

Sci Rep	2018	The benefits of adult stem cells for repair of the heart have been attributed to the repertoire of salutary paracrine activities they appear to exert. We previously isolated human W8B2+ cardiac stem cells (CSCs) and found they powerfully influence cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells to collectively promote cardiac repair and regeneration. Here, the complexity of the W8B2+ CSC secretomes was characterised and examined in more detail. Using ion exchange chromatography to separate soluble proteins based on their net surface charge, the secreted factors responsible for the pro-survival activity of W8B2+ CSCs were found within the low and medium cation fractions. In addition to the soluble proteins, extracellular vesicles generated from W8B2+ CSCs not only exhibited pro-survival and pro-angiogenic activities, but also promoted proliferation of neonatal cardiomyocytes. These extracellular vesicles contain a cargo of proteins, mRNA and primary microRNA precursors that are enriched in exosomes and are capable of modulating collectively many of the cellular pathways involved in protein metabolism, cell growth, as well as cellular responses to stress and organisation of the extracellular matrix. Thus the W8B2+ CSC secretome contains a multitude of bioactive paracrine factors we have now characterised, that might well be harnessed for therapeutic application for cardiac repair and regeneration.

Life Sci	2018	BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been demonstrated to play crucial role in tumor growth and metastasis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LncRNA FAL1 has been indicated to promote the progression of various cancers. However, the role of lncRNA FAL1 in HCC was poorly understood. METHODS: The expression levels of lncRNA FAL1 in HCC tissues and cells were determined by RT-qPCR. The roles of lncRNA FAL1 on HCC cells were investigated by MTT, colony formation, transwell, RT-qPCR, and Western blotting. The miRNA binding sites of lncRNA FAL1 was predicted using RegRNA 2.0 and miR-1236 was validated to target lncRNA FAL1 by luciferase reporter assays and RT-qPCR. Finally, the expression levels of lncRNA FAL1 in serum exosome of HCC patients was also investigated and the role of exosome-mediated lncRNA FAL1 was further investigated by co-culturing with HCC cells. RESULTS: This study first showed that lncRNA FAL1 was up-regulated in HCC tissues and functioned as an oncogene in HCC. LncRNA FAL1 could accelerate cell proliferation and metastasis as a ceRNA mechanism by competitively binding to miR-1236. Moreover, lncRNA FAL1 was also up-regulated in serum exosome of HCC patients and could transfer lncRNA FAL1 to HCC cells to increase their abilities of cell proliferation and migration. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this study indicated that lncRNA FAL1 functions as an oncogenic in HCC and may be a novel diagnostic biomarker or a novel target for the treatment of HCC in future.	
29463370	Qiugen Wang				Exchangeability of FITC-SiO₂ Nanoparticles Between Cancer Cells Increases the Range of Drug Delivery.	J Biomed Nanotechnol	2018	Drug delivery system studies aim to improve nanoparticle (NP) formulation to enable efficient delivery of NPs to tumors. However, NPs must be transported by blood or through direct injection. How NPs leave the circulatory system and how NPs diffuse into a tumor remain unclear, and this uncertainty is a limitation of drug delivery systems. The intimate connection between these questions and metabolism may be related to their biosafety in vivo. Thus, in this study, classical carrier SiO2 NPs were used as typical transport NPs, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was used as the representative drug and tracer. As exosome and tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are the most relevant mechanism for NP transportation and considering the local situation in a tumor, we focused on identifying this phenomenon and investigating TNTs. In conclusion, we effectively demonstrated that NPs can be transferred from cell to cell. Nanotubes may play an important role in this process.

Biocompatibility of highly purified bovine milk-derived extracellular vesicles.	J Extracell Vesicles	2018	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) deliver biologically active cargos from donor cells to recipient cells for intercellular communication. Since the existence of RNA cargo was discovered, EVs have been considered to be useful drug-delivery systems. Specifically, EVs from bovine milk (mEV) are one of the most promising platforms, since bovine milk is a scalable source of EVs for mass production. However, it is still difficult to isolate pure EVs from bovine milk owing to the complexity of raw materials. Furthermore, the biocompatibility and immunotoxicity of mEVs are still unclear. In this study, we developed a new method for isolating bovine milk-derived EVs by employing acid treatment and ultracentrifugation. Isolated mEVs are spherical in shape, measure 120 nm in diameter and contain typical EV marker proteins, such as tetraspanins. Compared with the previously reported method, our method can isolate purer mEVs. When mEVs are contacted with the mouse macrophage cell line Raw264.7, mEVs are readily taken up by the cells without a cytotoxic effect, suggesting that mEVs can deliver the cargo molecules into cells. While systemic administration of mEVs into mice resulted in the absence of systemic toxicity, certain types of cytokines were slightly induced. No anaphylaxis effect was observed after serial administration of mEVs in mice. Thus, mEVs isolated using our method are well tolerated in vivo and may be useful for the drug-delivery application.

Nat Commun	2018	Exosomes are cell-derived nanovesicles (50-150 nm), which mediate intercellular communication, and are candidate therapeutic agents. However, inefficiency of exosomal message transfer, such as mRNA, and lack of methods to create designer exosomes have hampered their development into therapeutic interventions. Here, we report a set of EXOsomal transfer into cells (EXOtic) devices that enable efficient, customizable production of designer exosomes in engineered mammalian cells. These genetically encoded devices in exosome producer cells enhance exosome production, specific mRNA packaging, and delivery of the mRNA into the cytosol of target cells, enabling efficient cell-to-cell communication without the need to concentrate exosomes. Further, engineered producer cells implanted in living mice could consistently deliver cargo mRNA to the brain. Therapeutic catalase mRNA delivery by designer exosomes attenuated neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation in in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease, indicating the potential usefulness of the EXOtic devices for RNA delivery-based therapeutic applications.

J Pediatr Surg	2018	PURPOSE: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a devastating disease in premature infants. We previously showed that four stem cell (SC) types equivalently improve experimental NEC. Exosomes are intercellular nanovesicles containing RNA, miRNA, DNA, and protein. Because SC therapy faces challenges, our aim was to determine if the beneficial effects of SC are achievable with cell-free exosomes. METHODS: Exosomes from four SC types were compared: (1) amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal SC (AF-MSC); (2) bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC); (3) amniotic fluid-derived neural SC (AF-NSC); and (4) neonatal enteric NSC (E-NSC). Rat pups exposed to NEC received a varying concentration of a single type of exosome with control pups receiving PBS only. Intestinal damage was graded histologically. RESULTS: The incidence of NEC was 0% in unstressed pups and 60.7% in control pups subjected to NEC. Exosomes (4.0×108) reduced NEC incidence to: AF-MSC 25.0%; BM-MSC 23.1%; AF-NSC 11.1%; E-NSC 27.3%. When administered at a concentration of at least 4.0×108, all groups demonstrated a significant reduction in NEC compared to untreated pups. At this minimum concentration, there was no difference in treatment efficacy between exosomes and the SC from which they were derived. CONCLUSION: Stem cell-derived exosomes reduce the incidence and severity of experimental NEC as effectively as the stem cells from which they are derived, supporting the potential for novel cell-free exosome therapy for NEC.

Human tRNA-Derived Small RNAs Modulate Host-Oral Microbial Interactions.	J Dent Res	2018	Coevolution of the human host and its associated microbiota has led to sophisticated interactions to maintain a delicate homeostasis. Emerging evidence suggests that in addition to small molecules, peptides, and proteins, small regulatory noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) might play an important role in cross-domain interactions. In this study, we revealed the presence of diverse host transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) among human salivary sRNAs. We selected 2 tsRNAs (tsRNA-000794 and tsRNA-020498) for further study based on their high sequence similarity to specific tRNAs from a group of Gram-negative oral bacteria, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, a key oral commensal and opportunistic pathogen. We showed that the presence of F. nucleatum triggers exosome-mediated release of tsRNA-000794 and tsRNA-020498 by human normal oral keratinocyte cells. Furthermore, both tsRNA candidates exerted a growth inhibition effect on F. nucleatum, likely through interference with bacterial protein biosynthesis, but did not affect the growth of Streptococcus mitis, a health-associated oral Gram-positive bacterium whose genome does not carry sequences bearing high similarity to either tsRNA. Our data provide the first line of evidence for the modulatory role of host-derived tsRNAs in the microbial-host interaction.

Melanoma Res	2018	Exosomes are small homogenous membrane vesicles that derive from the exocytosis process of cells and can contain DNA, microRNAs (miRNAs), and/or proteins. Characterization of the content profile of exosomes may reflect the state of the cells that release them, and this could be predictive of disease. In this study, to explore the potential biomarkers for melanoma, we isolated serous exosomes from 30 patients with melanoma and 30 healthy individuals using the ultracentrifugation method. Five miRNAs were subsequently detected in each sample by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR: miRNA-532-5p, miRNA-106b, miRNA-200c, miRNA-199a-5p, and miRNA-210. Only the levels of exo-miRNA-532-5p and exo-miRNA-106b differed between the two groups (Z=-4.17 and -4.57, respectively, P<0.0001). When these two miRNAs were evaluated individually and in combination in 95 melanoma patients and 95 healthy individuals serum samples, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values were 0.867, 0.820, and 0.936, respectively. Furthermore, in blinded tests of samples from 25 melanoma patients and 25 healthy individuals, this panel of miRNAs identified 23/25 patients with melanoma (92.0% sensitivity) and 22/25 healthy individuals (88.0% sensitivity). Our exo-miRNA panel also distinguished patients with metastasis from those without metastasis, patients with stage I-II disease from those with stage III-IV disease, and patients who had received pembrolizumab treatment from those who were untreated. Overall, these results indicate that serum exosomal miRNAs, especially exo-miRNA-532-5p and exo-miRNA-106b, have the potential to be used for monitoring and/or a diagnosis of melanoma in a clinical setting.

Evidence for HSP70-like protein in the RBC membrane of the hereditarily anemic Belgrade laboratory (b/b) rat.	Mol Cell Biochem	1998	We have demonstrated that in normal and b/b rat red blood cells (RBCs) hsp70-like protein (heat shock protein 70-like) is localized in the cytosol and it is exported via exosomes during in vivo reticulocytes maturation. As we have presumed, in the mutant (b/b) rat, hsp70-like protein transfers from cytosol to the RBC membrane. In the normal rat RBCs this happens when those cells are submitted to heat stress conditions. Our study indicates that the presence of hsp70-like protein in the b/b rat RBC plasma membrane is consistent with a primary defect and is not a consequence of life long stress, i.e. hypoxia.

Toxoplasma gondii antigen-pulsed-dendritic cell-derived exosomes induce a protective immune response against T. gondii infection.	Infect Immun	2004	It was previously demonstrated that immunizing mice with spleen dendritic cells (DCs) that had been pulsed ex vivo with Toxoplasma gondii antigens triggers a systemic Th1-biased specific immune response and induces protection against infection. T. gondii can cause severe sequelae in the fetuses of mothers who acquire the infection during pregnancy, as well as life-threatening neuropathy in immunocompromised patients, in particular those with AIDS. Here, we investigate the efficacy of a novel cell-free vaccine composed of DC exosomes, which are secreted antigen-presenting vesicles that express functional major histocompatibility complex class I and II and T-cell-costimulatory molecules. They have already been shown to induce potent antitumor immune responses. We investigated the potential of DC2.4 cell line-derived exosomes to induce protective immunity against toxoplasmosis. Our data show that most adoptively transferred T. gondii-pulsed DC-derived exosomes were transferred to the spleen, elicited a strong systemic Th1-modulated Toxoplasma-specific immune response in vivo, and conferred good protection against infection. These findings support the possibility that DC-derived exosomes can be used for T. gondii immunoprophylaxis and for immunoprophylaxis against many other pathogens.	PMC427397

Exosomes derived from genetically modified DC expressing FasL are anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive.	Mol Ther	2006	We previously have demonstrated the ability of primary murine bone marrow-derived DC (BM-DC), genetically modified by adenoviral infection to express FasL, to inhibit progression of established collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) following systemic delivery. Here we demonstrate that exosomes derived from genetically modified BM-DC expressing FasL are able to inhibit inflammation in a murine footpad model of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). Local administration of exosomes derived from DC expressing FasL (Exo/FasL) as well as the parental DC/FasL resulted in a significant reduction in swelling in both the treated and the untreated distal paw. However, both the DC/FasL and the Exo/FasL were unable to suppress the DTH response in lpr (Fas-deficient) mice. Gene transfer of FasL to BM-DC from gld (FasL-deficient) mice resulted in restoration of the ability of DC as well as DC-derived exosomes to suppress DTH. The ability of DC-derived exosomes and DC to suppress DTH responses was antigen specific and MHC class II dependent, but class I independent. The injected exosomes were found to be internalized into CD11c(+) cells at the site of injection and in the draining popliteal lymph node. Systemic injection of exosome/FasL into mice with established CIA resulted in significant disease amelioration. These results demonstrate that both systemic and local administration of exosomes derived from FasL-expressing DC are able to suppress antigen-specific immune responses through an MHC class II-dependent pathway, resulting in effective and sustained treatment of established collagen-induced arthritis and suppression of the DTH inflammatory response. These results suggest that DC/FasL-derived exosomes could be used clinically for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

Surface anchorage of superantigen SEA promotes induction of specific antitumor immune response by tumor-derived exosomes.	J Mol Med (Berl)	2007	Tumor-derived exosomes have been regarded as a new kind of cancer vaccine; however, their therapeutic efficacy needs to be further improved. Superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA)-coated tumor cells have been shown to potently induce tumor-specific T cell response. To increase efficacy of tumor-derived exosomes to induce antitumor immune response, we modified the exosomes by protein transfer of SEA tailed with a highly hydrophobic transmembrane domain (SEA-TM) and designated those SEA-TM-anchored exosomes as Exo/SEA-TM. We found the exosomes secreted from murine lymphoma E.G7-OVA cell line were round vesicles with the sizes of 40-100 nm limited by a bilayer membrane. Interestingly, the inner structure of the exosomes were visible under the transmission electron microscope; those "honeycomb-like" inner structure has not been described by other labs. Immunization with Exo/SEA-TM inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of the mice challenged with parental tumor cells more significantly than with exosomes (Exo) and even more than with the mixture of exosomes and SEA-TM. The results of mixed lymphocyte-tumor reaction (MLTR) showed that the increased IL-2, IFN-gamma secretion, and specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) could be effectively induced from the splenic lymphocytes of the mice immunized with Exo/SEA-TM. In vivo depletion experiments showed that CD8(+) T cells are the main effector cells, and both CD4(+) T cells and NK cells are also involved in the antitumor effect of Exo/SEA-TM immunization. Therefore, tumor-derived exosomes surface anchored with SEA-TM can efficiently induce tumor-specific CTL thereby resulting in more potent inhibition of tumor growth. Our data provide an efficient and novel approach to tumor immunotherapy by protein modification of tumor-derived exosomes.

Malignant ascites-derived exosomes of ovarian carcinoma patients contain CD24 and EpCAM.	Gynecol Oncol	2007	OBJECTIVE: CD24 is an established marker for poor prognosis in ovarian and other carcinomas. Acquisition of cytoplasmic CD24, as opposed to membranous expression, has been correlated with a higher invasiveness of tumor cells. Exosomes are small vesicles of endosomal origin that are often secreted by tumor cells. Given the emerging role of exosomes in tumor progression, we investigated whether cytoplasmic CD24 expression is correlated with the secretion of CD24 in exosomes. METHODS: We used CD24 transfected carcinoma cell lines, ovarian carcinoma cell lines and malignant ascites fluid of ovarian carcinoma patients. Exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation and sucrose density fractionation and subsequently examined by Western blot analysis and gelatine zymography. In tissue sections CD24 was detected by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: We show that CD24 is released by transfected as well as endogenously expressing cells in vesicles that represent exosomes. CD24 was also identified in exosomes isolated from ascites fluid of ovarian carcinoma patients. In 16 ovarian carcinomas analyzed no correlation between CD24 in tumor tissue sections and the appearance of CD24 in exosomes was detected. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), known to be overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas, is secreted in exosomes. The ascites exosomes contain gelatinolytic enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies CD24 and EpCAM as cargo proteins of exosomes of cultured cell lines and malignant ascites. The exosome-associated proteolytic activity in the tumor vicinity might augment tumor invasion into the stroma.

HIV-1 Nef protein is secreted into vesicles that can fuse with target cells and virions.	Ethn Dis	2008	HIV-1 Nef is a major determinant in HIV-1 pathogenicity. However, its properties have mainly been associated with its biochemical activities within the producer cell. Nef is also secreted from infected and transfected cells. Our primary objective was to determine the nature of secreted Nef protein and its effect on target cells. We determined that HIV-1 Nef is secreted in the form of exosome-like vesicles. Nef protein present in these vesicles is largely protected from protease digestion, which suggests that most of the protein is present on the lumenal side of the vesicles. We observed that HEK293 cells, transfected with a Nef-GFP expression vector, can secrete vesicles containing Nef-GFP fusion protein into the extracellular medium. When the conditioned medium was used to treat Jurkat cells, we found that the cells can take up the Nef fusion protein. The pattern of distribution of the Nef-GFP fusion protein within the target cells is mainly cytoplasmic and results in a punctate staining pattern. We also observed that Nef (-) virions treated with Nef-conditioned medium have their infectivity restored to near wild-type levels. This implies that the Nef contained within vesicles has the ability to fuse with HIV-1 virions and deliver functional Nef to these virions. It also demonstrates that Nef protein delivered in trans can restore infectivity even after virion maturation has occurred.

FASEB J	2009	Airway mucus forms the structural basis of the local innate immune defense mechanism. It is an integrated, active, viscoelastic gel matrix evolved to protect the exposed lung from physical, chemical, and pathological erosion. Exosomes are biologically active vesicles secreted by different cell types including epithelial, hematopoietic, and some tumor cells. They are also present in some biological fluids such as serum, urine, breast milk, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that exosome-like vesicles with antiviral properties are present in human tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cell culture secretions. These vesicles have been isolated by differential centrifugation and are characterized further by mass spectrometry, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and light-scattering methods. HTBE vesicles exhibited characteristic exosomal size (30-100 nm) and morphology (cup-shaped) with a buoyant density in sucrose of 1.12-1.18 g/ml. Biochemical characterization further revealed typical surface, cytoskeletal, and cytoplasmic proteins characteristic of exosomes, including the multivesicular and late endosomal membrane markers Tsg101 and CD63. The presence of RNA was also observed. The epithelial mucins MUC1, MUC4, and MUC16 also contributed to the vesicles' structure. Notably, alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid was associated with these mucin molecules and subsequent functional analysis showed that these vesicles have a neutralizing effect on human influenza virus, which is known to bind sialic acid. Taken together, these findings suggest that airway epithelial cells release exosome-like vesicles and that these structures may be involved in diverse physiological processes in airway biology, including innate mucosal defense.

19786948		Consortium for Translational Research in Advanced Imaging and Nanomedicine (C-TRAIN)			Paracrine induction of endothelium by tumor exosomes.	Lab Invest	2009	Cancers use a nanoscale messenger system known as exosomes to communicate with surrounding tissues and immune cells. However, the functional relationship between tumor exosomes, endothelial signaling, angiogenesis, and metastasis is poorly understood. Herein, we describe a standardized approach for defining the angiogenic potential of isolated exosomes. We created a powerful technique to rapidly and efficiently isolate and track exosomes for study using dynamic light scattering in conjunction with fluorescent exosome labeling. With these methods, melanoma exosomes were observed to interact with and influence endothelial tubule morphology as well as move between endothelial tubule cells by means of tunneling nanotube structures. Melanoma exosomes also were observed to rapidly stimulate the production of endothelial spheroids and endothelial sprouts in a dose-dependent manner. In concert, tumor exosomes simultaneously elicited paracrine endothelial signaling by regulation of certain inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest that, tumor exosomes can promote endothelial angiogenic responses, which could contribute to tumor metastatic potential.	PMC3316485

World J Gastroenterol	2010	AIM: To study the effect of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) on heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), human leucocyte antigen-I (HLA-I) and NY-ESO-1 proteins in exosomes produced by hepatoma cells, HepG2 and Hep3B. METHODS: Exosomes derived from HepG(2) and Hep3B cells treated with or without 5-aza-CdR were isolated and purified by ultrafiltration centrifugation and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The number of exosomes was counted under electron microscope. Concentration of proteins in exosomes was measured by bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Expression of HSP70, HLA-I and NY-ESO-1 proteins in exosomes was detected by Western blotting and immunoelectron microscopy. mRNA expression of p53 gene was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of p53 gene was increased in both hepatoma cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-CdR. The number of exosomes and the concentration of total proteins in exosomes were increased significantly after treatment with 5-aza-CdR (P < 0.05). After treatment with 5-aza-CdR, immunoelectron microscopy and Western blotting showed that the HSP70, HLA-I and NY-ESO-1 proteins were increased in exosomes produced by both hepatoma cell lines. CONCLUSION: 5-Aza-CdR, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, can increase exosomes produced by hepatoma cells and immune-associated protein component of exosomes, which may be mediated by p53 gene up-regulation and 5-aza-CdR demethylation.

Extra-cellular release and blood diffusion of BART viral micro-RNAs produced by EBV-infected nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.	Virol J	2010	BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a human epithelial malignancy consistently associated with the Epstein-Barr virus. The viral genome is contained in the nuclei of all malignant cells with abundant transcription of a family of viral microRNAs called BART miRNAs. MicroRNAs are well known intra-cellular regulatory elements of gene expression. In addition, they are often exported in the extra-cellular space and sometimes transferred in recipient cells distinct from the producer cells. Extra-cellular transport of the microRNAs is facilitated by various processes including association with protective proteins and packaging in secreted nanovesicles called exosomes. Presence of microRNAS produced by malignant cells has been reported in the blood and saliva of tumor-bearing patients, especially patients diagnosed with glioblastoma or ovarian carcinoma. In this context, it was decided to investigate extra-cellular release of BART miRNAs by NPC cells and their possible detection in the blood of NPC patients. To address this question, we investigated by quantitative RT-PCR the status of 5 microRNAs from the BART family in exosomes released by NPC cells in vitro as well as in plasma samples from NPC xenografted nude mice and NPC patients. RESULTS: We report that the BART miRNAs are released in the extra-cellular space by NPC cells being associated, at least to a large extent, with secreted exosomes. They are detected with a good selectivity in plasma samples from NPC xenografted nude mice as well as NPC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Viral BART miRNAs are secreted by NPC cells in vitro and in vivo. They have enough stability to diffuse from the tumor site to the peripheral blood. This study provides a basis to explore their potential as a source of novel tumor biomarkers and their possible role in communications between malignant and non-malignant cells.	PMC2974674
21373966	Muhua Yang	Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Wolf Hall, Newark, DE 19716, USA. 	yangmugua@gmail.com		L1 stimulation of human glioma cell motility correlates with FAK activation.	J Neurooncol	2011	The neural adhesion/recognition protein L1 (L1CAM; CD171) has been shown or implicated to function in stimulation of cell motility in several cancer types, including high-grade gliomas. Our previous work demonstrated the expression and function of L1 protein in stimulation of cell motility in rat glioma cells. However, the mechanism of this stimulation is still unclear. This study further investigated the function of L1 and L1 proteolysis in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell migration and invasion, as well as the mechanism of this stimulation. L1 mRNA was found to be present in human T98G GBM cell line but not in U-118 MG grade III human glioma cell line. L1 protein expression, proteolysis, and release were found in T98G cells and human surgical GBM cells by Western blotting. Exosome-like vesicles released by T98G cells were purified and contained full-length L1. In a scratch assay, T98G cells that migrated into the denuded scratch area exhibited upregulation of ADAM10 protease expression coincident with loss of surface L1. GBM surgical specimen cells exhibited a similar loss of cell surface L1 when xenografted into the chick embryo brain. When lentivirally introduced shRNA was used to attenuate L1 expression, such T98G/shL1 cells exhibited significantly decreased cell motility by time lapse microscopy in our quantitative Super Scratch assay. These cells also showed a decrease in FAK activity and exhibited increased focal complexes. L1 binding integrins which activate FAK were found in T98G and U-118 MG cells. Addition of L1 ectodomain-containing media (1) rescued the decreased cell motility of T98G/shL1 cells and (2) increased cell motility of U-118 MG cells but (3) did not further increase T98G cell motility. Injection of L1-attenuated T98G/shL1 cells into embryonic chick brains resulted in the absence of detectable invasion compared to control cells which invaded brain tissue. These studies support a mechanism where glioma cells at the edge of a cell mass upregulate ADAM10 to proteolyze surface L1 and the resultant ectodomain increases human glioma cell migration and invasion by binding to integrin receptors, activating FAK, and increasing turnover of focal complexes.

Insulinoma-released exosomes or microparticles are immunostimulatory and can activate autoreactive T cells spontaneously developed in nonobese diabetic mice.	J Immunol	2011	Exosomes (EXO) are secreted intracellular microparticles that can trigger inflammation and induce Ag-specific immune responses. To test possible roles of EXO in autoimmunity, we isolated small microparticles, mainly EXO, from mouse insulinoma and examined their activities to stimulate the autoimmune responses in NOD mice, a model for human type 1 diabetes. We demonstrate that the EXO contains strong innate stimuli and expresses candidate diabetes autoantigens. They can induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines through a MyD88-dependent pathway, and activate purified APC and result in T cell proliferation. To address whether EXO or the secreted microparticles are possible autoimmune targets causing islet-specific inflammation, we monitored the T cell responses spontaneously developed in prediabetic NOD mice for their reactivity to the EXO, and compared this reactivity between diabetes-susceptible and -resistant congenic mouse strains. We found that older NOD females, which have advanced islet destruction, accumulated more EXO-reactive, IFN-γ-producing lymphocytes than younger females or age-matched males, and that pancreatic lymph nodes from the prediabetic NOD, but not from the resistant mice, were also enriched with EXO-reactive Th1 cells. In vivo, immunization with the EXO accelerates insulitis development in nonobese diabetes-resistant mice. Thus, EXO or small microparticles can be recognized by the diabetes-associated autoreactive T cells, supporting that EXO might be a possible autoimmune target and/or insulitis trigger in NOD or congenic mouse strains.

Tumor cell cross talk with tumor-associated leukocytes leads to induction of tumor exosomal fibronectin and promotes tumor progression.	Am J Pathol	2012	Exosomes participate in intercellular communication, but most data published are based on exosomes released from in vitro cultured cells that do not communicate with neighboring cells located in the same microenvironment as the exosomal-producing cells in vivo. In this study, our data show that co-culture of leukocytes isolated from breast tumor tissue leads to uptake of fibronectin (FN) on or in the tumor exosomes (Exo(fib+)). The induction of FN and exosomal uptake is tumor tissue derived and leukocyte specific, because leukocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of naïve mice failed to induce FN uptake by tumor exosomes. Furthermore, depletion of both CD25(+) cells and Gr-1(+) cells from tumor-associated leukocytes causes a reduction of Exo(fib+), suggesting that tumor-associated CD25(+) cells and Gr-1(+) cells participate in FN production and uptake by tumor exosomes, resulting in Exo(fib+). As a result of tumor cells absorbing Exo(fib+), two major events are induced: focal adhesion kinase/Src-dependent signaling pathways are activated, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and metalloproteinase 9 is enhanced in response to absorbing exosomes. This, in turn, enhances tumor cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that exosomes released from freshly excised tumor tissue cells that have communicated/interacted with immune cells gain new immune evasion capacity.

Paired helical filaments from Alzheimer disease brain induce intracellular accumulation of Tau protein in aggresomes.	J Biol Chem	2012	Abnormal folding of tau protein leads to the generation of paired helical filaments (PHFs) and neurofibrillary tangles, a key neuropathological feature in Alzheimer disease and tauopathies. A specific anatomical pattern of pathological changes developing in the brain suggests that once tau pathology is initiated it propagates between neighboring neuronal cells, possibly spreading along the axonal network. We studied whether PHFs released from degenerating neurons could be taken up by surrounding cells and promote spreading of tau pathology. Neuronal and non-neuronal cells overexpressing green fluorescent protein-tagged tau (GFP-Tau) were treated with isolated fractions of human Alzheimer disease-derived PHFs for 24 h. We found that cells internalized PHFs through an endocytic mechanism and developed intracellular GFP-Tau aggregates with attributes of aggresomes. This was particularly evident by the perinuclear localization of aggregates and redistribution of the vimentin intermediate filament network and retrograde motor protein dynein. Furthermore, the content of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau, a measure of abnormal tau aggregation, increased 3-fold in PHF-treated cells. An exosome-related mechanism did not appear to be involved in the release of GFP-Tau from untreated cells. The evidence that cells can internalize PHFs, leading to formation of aggresome-like bodies, opens new therapeutic avenues to prevent propagation and spreading of tau pathology.	PMC3370237

Toward tailored exosomes: the exosomal tetraspanin web contributes to target cell selection.	Int J Biochem Cell Biol	2012	Exosomes are discussed as potent therapeutics due to efficient transfer of proteins, mRNA and miRNA in selective targets. However, therapeutic exosome application requires knowledge on target structures to avoid undue delivery. Previous work suggesting exosomal tetraspanin-integrin complexes to be involved in target cell binding, we aimed to control this hypothesis and to define target cell ligands. Exosomes are rich in tetraspanins that associate besides other molecules with integrins. Co-immunoprecipitation of exosome lysates from rat tumor lines that differ only with respect to Tspan8 and beta4 revealed promiscuity of tetraspanin-integrin associations, but also few preferential interactions like that of Tspan8 with alpha4 and beta4 integrin chains. These minor differences in exosomal tetraspanin-complexes strongly influence target cell selection in vitro and in vivo, efficient exosome-uptake being seen in hematopoietic cells and solid organs. Exosomes expressing the Tspan8-alpha4 complex are most readily taken up by endothelial and pancreas cells, CD54 serving as a major ligand. Selectivity of uptake was confirmed with exosomes from an alpha4 cDNA transfected Tspan8(+) lymph node stroma line. Distinct from exosomes from the parental line, the latter preferentially targeted endothelial cells and in vivo the pancreas. Importantly, pulldown experiments provided strong evidence that exosome-uptake occurs in internalization-prone membrane domains. This is the first report on the exosomal tetraspanin web contributing to target cell selection such that predictions can be made on potential targets, which will facilitate tailoring exosomes for drug delivery.

Placenta	2012	OBJECTIVES: To examine whether syncytin-1 has immune regulatory functions and is carried by human placental exosomes. Further, to examine whether corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) can induce the production of syncytin-1. STUDY DESIGN: Human placental exosomes were isolated from placental explant, primary trophoblast and BeWo cell cultures. The presence of exosomes was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and western blotting. Exosomal protein was probed with 3 separate antibodies targeting syncytin-1. Syncytin-1 immunosuppression was tested, using either a syncytin-1 recombinant ectodomain protein or a synthetic peptide with the human syncytin-1 immunosuppressive domain sequence, in an in vitro human blood culture system immune challenged with LPS or PHA. The inhibition of cytokine production by syncytin-1 was determined by ELISA of TNF-α, IFN-γ and CXCL10. BeWo cells were stimulated with CRH or vehicle for 24 h. mRNA and Protein was extracted from the cells for real-time PCR and western blotting analysis while exosomes were extracted from conditioned media for analysis by western blotting. RESULTS: Protein expression of syncytin-1 was detected in exosomes isolated from placental explants, primary trophoblast and BeWo cell cultures. Syncytin-1 recombinant ectodomain was also shown to inhibit the production of the Th1 cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ as well as the chemokine, CXCL10 in human blood cells. Finally, this study showed that syncytin-1 can be stimulated by CRH. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of syncytin-1 in placental exosomes provides a mechanism for syncytin-1 to reach and interact with target cells of the maternal immune system and represents a novel mechanism of endogenous retroviral mediated immunosuppression that may be relevant for maternal immune tolerance.

Transsynaptic modality codes in the brain: possible involvement of synchronized spike timing, microRNAs, exosomes and epigenetic processes.	Front Integr Neurosci	2012	This paper surveys two different mechanisms by which a presynaptic cell can modulate the structure and function of the postsynaptic cell. We first present the evidence that this occurs, and then discuss two mechanisms that could bring this about. The first hypothesis relates to the long lasting effects that the spike patterns of presynaptic axons may exert by modulating activity-inducible programs in postsynaptic cells. The second hypothesis is based on recently obtained evidence that, the afferent neuron at the neuromuscular junction buds off exosomes at its synapse and carries a cargo of Wg and Evi, which are large molecular transsynaptic signaling agents (LMTSAs). Further evidence indicates that many types of neurons bud off exosomes containing payloads of various lipids, proteins, and types of RNA. The evidence suggests that they are transmitted across the synapse and are taken up by the postsynaptic structure either by perisynaptic or exosynaptic mechanisms, thus mediating the transfer of information between neurons. To date, the molecular hypothesis has been limited to local interactions within the synapse of concern. In this paper, we explore the possibility that this represents a mechanism for information transfer involving the postsynaptic neuron as a whole. This entails a review of the known functions of these molecules in neuronal physiology, together with an estimate of the possible types of information they could carry and how they might affect neurocomputations.

The function of these vesicles is to allow cell-to-cell signaling and the horizontal transfer of their cargo molecules.

Methods of analysis of dendritic cell-derived exosome-shuttle microRNA and its horizontal propagation between dendritic cells.	Methods Mol Biol	2013	Exosomes are extremely small (<100 nm) membrane vesicles, generated in the endocytic compartment that are released to the extracellular milieu by living cells. Although the biological function of exosomes in vivo remains unclear, they seem to function as mechanisms of cell-to-cell communication for horizontal transfer of proteins, antigens, prions, morphogens, mRNA, and noncoding regulatory RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) (also known as exosome-shuttle miRNAs). Dendritic cells (DCs), the most potent professional antigen-presenting leukocytes of the immune system, release relatively high levels of exosomes and also interact with free exosomes present in the extracellular space. Therefore, DCs constitute a good model for the analysis of exosome-shuttle miRNAs and their horizontal propagation between cells. This chapter provides basic protocols for purification of exosomes released by mouse bone marrow-derived DCs, analysis of their miRNA content, and assessment of the function of exosome-shuttle miRNAs, once they are transferred to target/acceptor DCs.

Vaccine	2013	The effects of immunization with dendritic cell (DC) exosomes, which had been incubated with a tetraspanin-3 (Tspan-3) blocking antibody (Ab) or with an isotype-matched non-immune IgG, were studied using an experimental model of Eimeria tenella avian coccidiosis. Purified exosomes from cecal tonsil and splenic DCs expressed Tspan-3 protein. Chickens injected with exosomes incubated with the control IgG and derived from cecal tonsil DCs preloaded in vitro with E. tenella Ag had Ag-immunostaining cells in the ceca, but not the spleen. Conversely, Ag-containing cells were found only in the spleen, but not the ceca, of chickens given IgG treated splenic DC exosomes. Interestingly, chickens that received exosomes incubated with Tspan-3 Ab had Ag-containing cells observed in both lymphoid organs following administration of exosomes from either DC population. After injection of exosomes non-incubated with Tspan-3 Ab, greater numbers of cells secreting interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-16, interferon-γ, and E. tenella-reactive Abs were observed in the cecal tonsils of chickens immunized with cecal DC exosomes compared with the spleen. By contrast, more cytokine-and Ab-producing cells were present in the spleen of chickens given splenic DC exosomes compared with the ceca. Incubation with Tspan-3 Ab gave similar numbers of cytokine- and Ab-producing cells in the cecal tonsils and spleen regardless of the source of exosomes. Immunization with E. tenella Ag-loaded cecal tonsil DC exosomes increased in vivo resistance against subsequent E. tenella infection. Increased protection against infection following cecal DC exosome immunization was partially blocked by incubation of exosomes with Tspan-3 Ab. These results suggest that Tspan-3 is involved in the tissue distribution, as well as cytokine and Ab production, following DC exosome administration, and that Tspan-3 contributes to in vivo protection against experimental E. tenella challenge infection following exosomal immunization.

Proteome profiling of neuroblastoma-derived exosomes reveal the expression of proteins potentially involved in tumor progression.	PLoS One	2013	Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood, with grim prognosis in a half of patients. Exosomes are nanometer-sized membrane vesicles derived from the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) of the endocytic pathway and released by normal and neoplastic cells. Tumor-derived exosomes have been shown in different model systems to carry molecules that promote cancer growth and dissemination. In this respect, we have here performed the first characterization and proteomic analysis of exosomes isolated from human NB cell lines by filtration and ultracentrifugation. Electron microscopy demonstrated that NB-derived exosomes exhibited the characteristic cup-shaped morphology. Dynamic light scattering studies showed a bell-shaped curve and a polydispersity factor consistent with those of exosomes. Zeta potential values suggested a good nanoparticle stability. We performed proteomic analysis of NB-derived exosomes by two dimension liquid chromatography separation and mass spectrometry analyses using the multidimensional protein identification technology strategy. We found that the large majority of the proteins identified in NB derived exosomes are present in Exocarta database including tetraspanins, fibronectin, heat shock proteins, MVB proteins, cytoskeleton-related proteins, prominin-1 (CD133), basigin (CD147) and B7-H3 (CD276). Expression of the CD9, CD63 and CD81 tetraspanins, fibronectin, CD133, CD147 and CD276 was validated by flow cytometry. Noteworthy, flow cytometric analysis showed that NB-derived exosomes expressed the GD2 disialoganglioside, the most specific marker of NB. In conclusion, this study shows that NB-derived exosomes express a discrete set of molecules involved in defense response, cell differentiation, cell proliferation and regulation of other important biological process. Thus, NB-derived exosomes may play an important role in the modulation of tumor microenvironment and represent potential tumor biomarkers.	PMC3777909

Electronic address: .	galvarez@fjd.es		Diabetic nephropathy induces changes in the proteome of human urinary exosomes as revealed by label-free comparative analysis.	J Proteomics	2014	Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Exosomes isolated from urine are considered a rich non-invasive source of markers for renal events. Proteinuria associated with DN patients at advanced stages may result in "contamination" of exosomal fraction by co-precipitation of high abundance urine proteins, making it enormously difficult to obtain a reliable comparison of healthy individuals and DN patients and to detect minor proteins. We evaluated different protocols for urinary exosome isolation (ultracentrifugation-based and Exoquick® reagent-based) in combination with an easy and quick depletion procedure of contaminating high abundance proteins (albumin). The optimal methodology was then applied to investigate the proteome of human urinary exosomes in DN and controls using spectral counting LC-MS/MS analysis followed by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) confirmation. A panel of 3 proteins (AMBP, MLL3, and VDAC1) is differentially present in urinary exosomes from DN patients, opening a new field of research focused on improving diagnosis and follow-up of this pathology. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a progressive proteinuric kidney disease, a major complication of diabetes mellitus, and the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. Current markers of disease (i.e. creatinine and urinary albumin excretion) have proven limitations (i.e. some patients regress to normoalbuminuria, kidney damage may be already present in recently diagnoses microalbuminuric patients and renal function may decrease in the absence of significant albuminuria). We show here the first study on human DN proteome of urinary exosomes. Proteinuria associated to DN patients resulting in contamination of exosomal fraction and the associated difficulty to reliably compare healthy and disease conditions, are here overcome. A combined methodology pointed to increase exosomal proteome recovery and depletion of high-abundance proteome was here set-up. A total of 352 proteins were here identified for the first time associated to human urinary exosomes. Label-free quantitative comparison of DN urinary exosomes vs control group and SRM further validation, resulted in the discovery of a panel of three proteins (AMBP, MLL3 and VDAC1) which changes in DN, opening a new field of research focused to improve diagnosis and follow-up of this pathology.

Toxoplasma gondii infection of fibroblasts causes the production of exosome-like vesicles containing a unique array of mRNA and miRNA transcripts compared to serum starvation.	J Extracell Vesicles	2013	BACKGROUND: Until recently thought to be of little significance unless occurring during pregnancy, Toxoplasma gondii infection of human hosts is now known to play a larger role in mental health and is a growing concern in the health care community. We sought to elucidate a possible mechanism by which Toxoplasma infection may cause some of the behavioural pathology now associated with infection. We hypothesized that exosomes may be playing a role. METHODS: We utilized electron microscopy to detect the presence and size of extracellular vesicles in the supernatants of Toxoplasma-infected human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF). We then utilized microarray analysis to discern mRNA and miRNA content of the vesicles isolated from supernatants of Toxoplasma-infected (Toxo) and serum-starved (SS) HFF. RESULTS: We recovered extracellular vesicles with a size consistent with exosomes that we called exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) from the supernatants of SS and Toxo cultures. The mRNA and miRNA content of these ELVs was highly regulated creating specific and unique expression profiles comparing Toxo ELVs, SS ELVs and RNA isolated from whole cell homogenates. Interestingly, among the most enriched mRNA isolated from ELVs of Toxo cells are 4 specific mRNA species that have been described in the literature as having neurologic activity: Rab-13, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1, thymosin beta 4 and LLP homolog. In addition, miRNA species uniquely expressed in Toxo ELVs include miR-23b, a well-known regulator of IL-17. CONCLUSION: While the production of ELVs containing mRNAs that modify behaviour are consistent with reported Toxoplasma pathology, the mechanism of enrichment and ultimate in vivo effect of these mRNA and miRNA containing ELVs remains to be investigated.

BMC Cancer	2014	BACKGROUND: Membrane vesicles released by neoplastic cells into extracellular medium contain potential of carrying arrays of oncogenic molecules including proteins and microRNAs (miRNA). Extracellular (exosome-like) vesicles play a major role in cell-to-cell communication. Thus, the characterization of proteins and miRNAs of exosome-like vesicles is imperative in clarifying intercellular signaling as well as identifying disease markers. METHODS: Exosome-like vesicles were isolated using gradient centrifugation from MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cultures. Proteomic profiling of vesicles using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed different protein profiles of exosome-like vesicles derived from MCF-7 cells (MCF-Exo) than those from MDA-MB 231 cells (MDA-Exo). RESULTS: The protein database search has identified 88 proteins in MDA-Exo and 59 proteins from MCF-Exo. Analysis showed that among all, 27 proteins were common between the two exosome-like vesicle types. Additionally, MDA-Exo contains a higher amount of matrix-metalloproteinases, which might be linked to the enhanced metastatic property of MDA-MB 231 cells. In addition, microarray analysis identified several oncogenic miRNA between the two types vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of the oncogenic factors in exosome-like vesicles is important since such vesicles could convey signals to non-malignant cells and could have an implication in tumor progression and metastasis.

The influence of rotor type and centrifugation time on the yield and purity of extracellular vesicles.	J Extracell Vesicles	2014	BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EV), the collective term for vesicles released from cells, consist of vesicle species ranging in size from 30 nm to 5 µm in diameter. These vesicles are most commonly isolated by differential centrifugations, which pellets particles based on their differential movement through the liquid medium in which they are immersed. Multiple parameters, including the utilization of different rotor types, can influence the yield and purity of isolated vesicles; however, the understanding of how these factors affect is limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we compare the influence of multiple centrifugation parameters, including the use of swinging bucket and fixed angle rotors, as well as different centrifugation times, for the isolation of the smallest EVs, "exosomes." In particular, we determine the yields of exosomal RNA and protein, as well as the nature of the isolated vesicles and possible protein contamination with methods such as electron microscopy, western blot and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our results show that application of a specific g-force or rotation speed by itself does not predict the ability of pelleting exosomes, and that prolonged centrifugation times can achieve greater yields of exosomal RNA and protein, whereas very long centrifugation times result in excessive protein concentrations in the exosome pellet. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, rotor type, g-force and centrifugation times significantly influence exosome yield during centrifugation-based isolation procedures, and current commonly recommended isolation protocols may not be fully optimized for yield and purity of exosomes.

Nucleic Acids Res	2014	miRNAs are 20-22 nt long post-transcriptional regulators in metazoan cells that repress protein expression from their target mRNAs. These tiny regulatory RNAs follow tissue and cell-type specific expression pattern, aberrations of which are associated with various diseases. miR-122 is a liver-specific anti-proliferative miRNA that, we found, can be transferred via exosomes between human hepatoma cells, Huh7 and HepG2, grown in co-culture. Exosomal miR-122, expressed and released by Huh7 cells and taken by miR-122 deficient HepG2 cells, was found to be effective in repression of target mRNAs and to reduce growth and proliferation of recipient HepG2 cells. Interestingly, in a reciprocal process, HepG2 secretes Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1) that decreases miR-122 expression in Huh7 cells. Our observations suggest existence of a reciprocal interaction between two different hepatic cells with distinct miR-122 expression profiles. This interaction is mediated via intercellular exosome-mediated miR-122 transfer and countered by a reciprocal IGF1-dependent anti-miR-122 signal. According to our data, human hepatoma cells use IGF1 to prevent intercellular exosomal transfer of miR-122 to ensure its own proliferation by preventing expression of growth retarding miR-122 in neighbouring cells.

Extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer of long non-coding RNA ROR modulates chemosensitivity in human hepatocellular cancer.	FEBS Open Bio	2014	Hepatocellular cancers (HCC) are highly resistant to chemotherapy. TGFβ has been associated with chemoresistance in some human cancers but the mechanisms involved are unknown. We explored how TGFβ might contribute to altered responses to therapy by assessing the involvement and mechanistic contribution of extracellular vesicle long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in mediating TGFβ-dependent chemoresistance. TGFβ reduced the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib or doxorubicin and altered the release of both extracellular vesicles and of selected lncRNA within these vesicles. Amongst these, lincRNA-ROR (linc-ROR), a stress-responsive lncRNA was highly expressed in HCC cells and enriched within extracellular vesicles derived from tumor cells. Incubation with HCC-derived extracellular vesicles increased linc-ROR expression and reduced chemotherapy-induced cell death in recipient cells. Sorafenib increased linc-ROR expression in both tumor cells and extracellular vesicles, whereas siRNA to linc-ROR increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity. Tumor-initiating cells that express CD133 have an increased resistance to therapy. TGFβ increased expression of CD133+ cells and colony growth in limiting dilution assays, both of which were attenuated by linc-ROR knockdown. These data provide mechanistic insights into primary chemoresistance in HCC by showing that: (a) TGFβ selectively enriches linc-RoR within extracellular vesicles, which has a potential role in intercellular signaling in response to TGFβ; (b) expression and enrichment of linc-ROR during chemotherapeutic stress plays a functional role in chemoresistance; and (c) the effects of TGFβ on chemoresistance in HCC may involve linc-RoR-dependent effects on tumor-initiating cells. These findings implicate extracellular vesicle lncRNA as mediators of the chemotherapeutic response, and support targeting linc-ROR to enhance chemosensitivity in HCC.	PMC4050189

Macrophage immunomodulation by breast cancer-derived exosomes requires Toll-like receptor 2-mediated activation of NF-κB.	Sci Rep	2014	Growing evidence links tumor progression with chronic inflammatory processes and dysregulated activity of various immune cells. In this study, we demonstrate that various types of macrophages internalize microvesicles, called exosomes, secreted by breast cancer and non-cancerous cell lines. Although both types of exosomes targeted macrophages, only cancer-derived exosomes stimulated NF-κB activation in macrophages resulting in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNFα, GCSF, and CCL2. In vivo mouse experiments confirmed that intravenously injected exosomes are efficiently internalized by macrophages in the lung and brain, which correlated with upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. In mice bearing xenografted human breast cancers, tumor-derived exosomes were internalized by macrophages in axillary lymph nodes thereby triggering expression of IL-6. Genetic ablation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or MyD88, a critical signaling adaptor in the NF-κB pathway, completely abolished the effect of tumor-derived exosomes. In contrast, inhibition of TLR4 or endosomal TLRs (TLR3/7/8/9) failed to abrogate NF-κB activation by exosomes. We further found that palmitoylated proteins present on the surface of tumor-secreted exosomes contributed to NF-κB activation. Thus, our results highlight a novel mechanism used by breast cancer cells to induce pro-inflammatory activity of distant macrophages through circulating exosomal vesicles secreted during cancer progression.

Physiol Rep	2014	Cilia, organelles that function as cellular antennae, are central to the pathogenesis of "ciliopathies", including various forms of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). To date, however, the molecular mechanisms controlling ciliogenesis and ciliary function remain incompletely understood. A recently proposed model of cell-cell communication, called "urocrine signaling", hypothesizes that a subset of membrane bound vesicles that are secreted into the urinary stream (termed exosome-like vesicles, or ELVs), carry cilia-specific proteins as cargo, interact with primary cilia, and affect downstream cellular functions. This study was undertaken to determine the role of the exocyst, a highly conserved eight-protein trafficking complex, in the secretion and/or retrieval of ELVs. We used Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing either Sec10-myc (a central component of the exocyst complex) or Smoothened-YFP (a ciliary protein found in ELVs) in experiments utilizing electron gold microscopy and live fluorescent microscopy, respectively. Additionally, human urinary exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation and subjected to mass-spectrometry-based proteomics analysis to determine the composition of ELVs. We found, as determined by EM, that the exocyst localizes to primary cilia, and is present in vesicles attached to the cilium. Furthermore, the entire exocyst complex, as well as most of its known regulatory GTPases, are present in human urinary ELVs. Finally, in living MDCK cells, ELVs appear to interact with primary cilia using spinning disc confocal microscopy. These data suggest that the exocyst complex, in addition to its role in ciliogenesis, is centrally involved in the secretion and/or retrieval of urinary ELVs.	PMC4246586

Prostate tumor-derived exosomes down-regulate NKG2D expression on natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells: mechanism of immune evasion.	PLoS One	2014	Tumor-derived exosomes, which are nanometer-sized extracellular vesicles of endosomal origin, have emerged as promoters of tumor immune evasion but their role in prostate cancer (PC) progression is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the ability of prostate tumor-derived exosomes to downregulate NKG2D expression on natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells. NKG2D is an activating cytotoxicity receptor whose aberrant loss in cancer plays an important role in immune suppression. Using flow cytometry, we found that exosomes produced by human PC cells express ligands for NKG2D on their surface. The NKG2D ligand-expressing prostate tumor-derived exosomes selectively induced downregulation of NKG2D on NK and CD8+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner, leading to impaired cytotoxic function in vitro. Consistent with these findings, patients with castration-resistant PC (CRPC) showed a significant decrease in surface NKG2D expression on circulating NK and CD8+ T cells compared to healthy individuals. Tumor-derived exosomes are likely involved in this NKG2D downregulation, since incubation of healthy lymphocytes with exosomes isolated from serum or plasma of CRPC patients triggered downregulation of NKG2D expression in effector lymphocytes. These data suggest prostate tumor-derived exosomes as down-regulators of the NKG2D-mediated cytotoxic response in PC patients, thus promoting immune suppression and tumor escape.	PMC4182531

J Biol Chem	2015	Exosomes are small vesicles released from cells into extracellular space. We have isolated exosomes from neuroblastoma cells and investigated their influence on the aggregation of α-synuclein, a protein associated with Parkinson disease pathology. Using cryo-transmission electron microscopy of exosomes, we found spherical unilamellar vesicles with a significant protein content, and Western blot analysis revealed that they contain, as expected, the proteins Flotillin-1 and Alix. Using thioflavin T fluorescence to monitor aggregation kinetics, we found that exosomes catalyze the process in a similar manner as a low concentration of preformed α-synuclein fibrils. The exosomes reduce the lag time indicating that they provide catalytic environments for nucleation. The catalytic effects of exosomes derived from naive cells and cells that overexpress α-synuclein do not differ. Vesicles prepared from extracted exosome lipids accelerate aggregation, suggesting that the lipids in exosomes are sufficient for the catalytic effect to arise. Using mass spectrometry, we found several phospholipid classes in the exosomes, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and the gangliosides GM2 and GM3. Within each class, several species with different acyl chains were identified. We then prepared vesicles from corresponding pure lipids or defined mixtures, most of which were found to retard α-synuclein aggregation. As a striking exception, vesicles containing ganglioside lipids GM1 or GM3 accelerate the process. Understanding how α-synuclein interacts with biological membranes to promote neurological disease might lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets.	PMC4317028

J Biol Chem	2015	Exosomes, cell-derived vesicles of endosomal origin, are continuously released in the extracellular environment and play a key role in intercellular crosstalk. In this study, we have investigated whether transfer of integrins through exosomes between prostate cancer (PrCa) cells occurs and whether transferred integrins promote cell adhesion and migration. Among others, we have focused on the αvβ6 integrin, which is not detectable in normal human prostate but is highly expressed in human primary PrCa as well as murine PrCa in Pten(pc-/-) mice. After confirming the fidelity of the exosome preparations by electron microscopy, density gradient, and immunoblotting, we determined that the αvβ6 integrin is actively packaged into exosomes isolated from PC3 and RWPE PrCa cell lines. We also demonstrate that αvβ6 is efficiently transferred via exosomes from a donor cell to an αvβ6-negative recipient cell and localizes to the cell surface. De novo αvβ6 expression in an αvβ6-negative recipient cell is not a result of a change in mRNA levels but is a consequence of exosome-mediated transfer of this integrin between different PrCa cells. Recipient cells incubated with exosomes containing αvβ6 migrate on an αvβ6 specific substrate, latency-associated peptide-TGFβ, to a greater extent than cells treated with exosomes in which αvβ6 is stably or transiently down-regulated by shRNA or siRNA, respectively. Overall, this study shows that exosomes from PrCa cells may contribute to a horizontal propagation of integrin-associated phenotypes, which would promote cell migration, and consequently, metastasis in a paracrine fashion.

Exosomal RNA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-Infected Cells Is Functional in Recipient Macrophages.	Traffic	2015	Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released by cells that carry proteins, lipids and nucleic acids and function in intercellular communication. Previously, we determined that exosomes released from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb)-infected macrophages carry mycobacterial proteins and lipids. However, the RNA composition within these exosomes has not been defined. In this study, we characterized the exosomes released from M.tb-infected macrophages and identified a cohort of mouse messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis showed less abundance of miRNAs in exosomes released from infected compared with uninfected macrophages. Moreover, more than 100 transcripts were found to be enriched or unique to exosomes from infected cells including transcripts involved in regulating an immune response. The exosomal RNA could be transferred and expressed in naïve macrophages and was biologically active, stimulating production of inflammatory mediators and inducing apoptosis in recipient cells. Interestingly, we also identified mycobacterial transcripts in exosomes released from infected macrophages. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify bacterial-derived RNA in exosomes. Our results suggest that exosomal RNA released from M.tb-infected macrophages may have functional and diagnostic potential in the context of a mycobacterial infection.	PMC5735426

Cell Mol Life Sci	2015	The biological phenomenon of cell fusion plays an important role in several physiological processes, like fertilization, placentation, or wound healing/tissue regeneration, as well as pathophysiological processes, such as cancer. Despite this fact, considerably less is still known about the factors and conditions that will induce the merging of two plasma membranes. Inflammation and proliferation has been suggested as a positive trigger for cell fusion, but it remains unclear, which of the factor(s) of the inflamed microenvironment are being involved. To clarify this we developed a reliable assay to quantify the in vitro fusion frequency of cells using a fluorescence double reporter vector (pFDR) containing a LoxP-flanked HcRed/DsRed expression cassette followed by an EGFP expression cassette. Because cell fusion has been implicated in cancer progression four human breast cancer cell lines were stably transfected with a pFDR vector and were co-cultured with the stably Cre-expressing human breast epithelial cell line. Cell fusion is associated with a Cre-mediated recombination resulting in induction of EGFP expression in hybrid cells, which can be quantified by flow cytometry. By testing a panel of different cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and other compounds, including exosomes, under normoxic and hypoxic conditions our data indicate that the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α together with hypoxia is a strong inducer of cell fusion in human MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

Sci Rep	2015	Circulating miRNAs can be found in extracellular vesicles (EV) and could be involved in intercellular communication. Here, we report the biodistribution of EV associated miR-155 using miR-155 KO mouse model. Administration of exosomes loaded with synthetic miR-155 mimic into miR-155 KO mice resulted in a rapid accumulation and clearance of miR-155 in the plasma with subsequent distribution in the liver, adipose tissue, lung, muscle and kidney (highest to lowest, respectively). miR-155 expression was detected in isolated hepatocytes and liver mononuclear cells of recipient KO mice suggesting its cellular uptake. In vitro, exosome-mediated restoration of miR-155 in Kupffer cells from miR-155 deficient mice augmented their LPS-induced MCP1 mRNA increase. The systemic delivery of wild type plasma to miR-155 KO mice also resulted in a rapid accumulation of miR-155 in the circulation and distribution to the liver and adipose tissue. In summary, our results demonstrate tissue biodistribution and biologic function of EV-associated miR-155.	PMC4448655

Coordinate regulation of residual bone marrow function by paracrine trafficking of AML exosomes.	Leukemia	2015	We recently demonstrated that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and patient-derived blasts release exosomes that carry RNA and protein; following an in vitro transfer, AML exosomes produce proangiogenic changes in bystander cells. We reasoned that paracrine exosome trafficking may have a broader role in shaping the leukemic niche. In a series of in vitro studies and murine xenografts, we demonstrate that AML exosomes downregulate critical retention factors (Scf, Cxcl12) in stromal cells, leading to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) mobilization from the bone marrow. Exosome trafficking also regulates HSPC directly, and we demonstrate declining clonogenicity, loss of CXCR4 and c-Kit expression, and the consistent repression of several hematopoietic transcription factors, including c-Myb, Cebp-β and Hoxa-9. Additional experiments using a model of extramedullary AML or direct intrafemoral injection of purified exosomes reveal that the erosion of HSPC function can occur independent of direct cell-cell contact with leukemia cells. Finally, using a novel multiplex proteomics technique, we identified candidate pathways involved in the direct exosome-mediated modulation of HSPC function. In aggregate, this work suggests that AML exosomes participate in the suppression of residual hematopoietic function that precedes widespread leukemic invasion of the bone marrow directly and indirectly via stromal components.

Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol	2015	A hallmark of liver fibrosis is the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which results in their production of fibrotic molecules, a process that is largely regulated by connective tissue growth factor (CCN2). CCN2 is increasingly expressed during HSC activation because of diminished expression of microRNA-214 (miR-214), a product of dynamin 3 opposite strand (DNM3os) that directly suppresses CCN2 mRNA. We show that an E-box in the miR-214 promoter binds the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Twist1, which drives miR-214 expression and results in CCN2 suppression. Twist1 expression was suppressed in HSC of fibrotic livers or in cultured HSC undergoing activation in vitro or after treatment with ethanol. Furthermore, Twist1 decreasingly interacted with DNM3os as HSC underwent activation in vitro. Nanovesicular exosomes secreted by quiescent but not activated HSC contained high levels of Twist1, thus reflecting the suppression of cellular Twist1 during HSC activation. Exosomal Twist1 was intercellularly shuttled between HSC and stimulated expression of miR-214 in the recipient cells, causing expression of CCN2 and its downstream effectors to be suppressed. Additionally, the miR-214 E-box in HSC was also regulated by hepatocyte-derived exosomes, showing that functional transfer of exosomal Twist1 occurs between different cell types. Finally, the levels of Twist1, miR-214, or CCN2 in circulating exosomes from fibrotic mice reflected fibrosis-induced changes in the liver itself, highlighting the potential utility of these and other constituents in serum exosomes as novel circulating biomarkers for liver fibrosis. These findings reveal a unique function for cellular or exosomal Twist1 in CCN2-dependent fibrogenesis.	PMC4572411

Fifteen young healthy volunteers (median age, 21.0 years) and 13 old individuals (median age, 66.0 years) were recruited. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected, salivary exosomes were isolated, and total RNA was extracted. In a microarray, 242 miRNAs were commonly detected in these two mixed samples. Based on the cut-off values of 2- or 0.5-fold changes (FC) and regulatory power for aging process, six candidate miRNAs (miR-24-3p, miR-371a-5p, miR-3175, miR-3162-5p, miR-671-5p, and miR-4667-5p) were selected. After comparing each total RNA obtained by the 15 young and 13 old individuals to validate the FC values using quantitative real-time PCR, miR-24-3p was identified as a novel candidate aging biomarker. This pilot study suggested that salivary exosomal miRNAs could be identified as candidate aging biomarkers. To confirm whether miR-24-3p in salivary exosomes are suitable biomarkers of aging, further validation research is required.	PMC4613253

Exosome-mediated microRNA transfer plays a role in radiation-induced bystander effect.	RNA Biol	2015	Bystander effects can be induced through cellular communication between irradiated cells and non-irradiated cells. The signals that mediate this cellular communication, such as cytokines, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and even microRNAs, can be transferred between cells via gap junctions or extracellular medium. We have previously reported that miR-21, a well described DDR (DNA damage response) microRNA, is involved in radiation-induced bystander effects through a medium-mediated way. However, the mechanisms of the microRNA transfer have not been elucidated in details. In the present study, it was found that exosomes isolated from irradiated conditioned medium could induce bystander effects. Furthermore, we demonstrated plenty of evidences that miR-21, which is up-regulated as a result of mimic transfection or irradiation, can be transferred from donor or irradiated cells into extracellular medium and subsequently get access to the recipient or bystander cells through exosomes to induce bystander effects. Inhibiting the miR-21 expression in advance can offset the bystander effects to some extent. From all of these results, it can be concluded that the exosome-mediated microRNA transfer plays an important role in the radiation-induced bystander effects. These findings provide new insights into the functions of microRNAs and the cellular communication between the directly irradiated cells and the non-irradiated cells.	PMC4829325

J Neurosci	2015	Failure of axonal regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) is mainly attributed to a lack of intrinsic neuronal growth programs and an inhibitory environment from a glial scar. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a major negative regulator of neuronal regeneration and, as such, inhibiting its activity has been considered a therapeutic target for spinal cord (SC) injuries (SCIs). Using a novel model of rat cervical avulsion, we show that treatment with a retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ) agonist results in locomotor and sensory recovery. Axonal regeneration from the severed roots into the SC could be seen by biotinylated dextran amine labeling. Light micrographs of the dorsal root entry zone show the peripheral nervous system (PNS)-CNS transition of regrown axons. RARβ agonist treatment also resulted in the absence of scar formation. Mechanism studies revealed that, in RARβ-agonist-treated neurons, PTEN activity is decreased by cytoplasmic phosphorylation and increased secretion in exosomes. These are taken up by astrocytes, resulting in hampered proliferation and causing them to arrange in a normal-appearing scaffold around the regenerating axons. Attribution of the glial modulation to neuronal PTEN in exosomes was demonstrated by the use of an exosome inhibitor in vivo and PTEN siRNA in vitro assays. The dual effect of RARβ signaling, both neuronal and neuronal-glial, results in axonal regeneration into the SC after dorsal root neurotmesis. Targeting this pathway may open new avenues for the treatment of SCIs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) often result in permanent damage in the adult due to the very limited capacity of axonal regeneration. Intrinsic neuronal programs and the formation of a glial scar are the main obstacles. Here, we identify a single target, neuronal retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ), which modulates these two aspects of the postinjury physiological response. Activation of RARβ in the neuron inactivates phosphatase and tensin homolog and induces its transfer into the astrocytes in small vesicles, where it prevents scar formation. This may open new therapeutic avenues for SCIs.	PMC4659830

J Control Release	2016	Exosomes released from skeletal muscle cells play important roles in myogenesis and muscle development via the transfer of specific signal molecules. In this study, we investigated whether exosomes secreted during myotube differentiation from human skeletal myoblasts (HSkM) could induce a cellular response from human adipose-derived stem cells (HASCs) and enhance muscle regeneration in a muscle laceration mouse model. The exosomes contained various signal molecules including myogenic growth factors related to muscle development, such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), and platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA). Interestingly, exosome-treated HASCs fused with neighboring cells at early time points and exhibited a myotube-like phenotype with increased expression of myogenic proteins (myosin heavy chain and desmin). On day 21, mRNAs of terminal myogenic genes were also up-regulated in exosome-treated HASCs. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrated that exosomes from differentiating HSkM reduced the fibrotic area and increased the number of regenerated myofibers in the injury site, resulting in significant improvement of skeletal muscle regeneration. Our findings suggest that exosomes act as a biochemical cue directing stem cell differentiation and provide a cell-free therapeutic approach for muscle regeneration.

Proteomic profiling of dextran sulfate sodium induced acute ulcerative colitis mice serum exosomes and their immunomodulatory impact on macrophages.	Proteomics	2016	Macrophages are essential for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, and their activation has been proposed to be critical to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there are many recognized mediators of macrophage activation, increasing evidence suggests that macrophages respond to exosome stimulation. Exosomes are 40-150 nm microvesicles released from different cell types and are found in a variety of physiological fluids, including serum. As studies have shown that circulating exosomes participate in intercellular communication and can mediate the immune response, we hypothesized that exosomes may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD though modulation of macrophage activity. In this study, we used the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced acute colitis mice model to investigate the effect of serum exosomes on macrophages and identify exosome proteins potentially involved in macrophage activation. We treated RAW264.7 macrophages with serum exosomes isolated from dextran sulfate sodium induced mice and found that treatment induced phosphorylation of p38 and ERK and production of tumor necrosis factor α when compared to treatment with exosomes isolated from control mice. Subsequent proteomic analysis identified 56 differentially expressed proteins, a majority of which were acute-phase proteins and immunoglobulins. Bioinformatics analysis suggested these proteins were mainly involved in the complement and coagulation cascade, which has been implicated in macrophage activation. Our findings provide new insight into the role of circulating serum exosomes in acute colitis and contribute to the understanding of macrophage activation in the pathogenesis of IBD.

J Gen Physiol	2016	The epithelial Na channel (ENaC) forms a pathway for Na(+) reabsorption in the distal nephron, and regulation of these channels is essential for salt homeostasis. In the rat kidney, ENaC subunits reached the plasma membrane in both immature and fully processed forms, the latter defined by either endoglycosidase H-insensitive glycosylation or proteolytic cleavage. Animals adapted to a low-salt diet have increased ENaC surface expression that is specific for the mature forms of the subunit proteins and is similar (three- to fourfold) for α, β, and γENaC. Kidney membranes were fractionated using differential centrifugation, sucrose-gradient separation, and immunoabsorption. Endoplasmic reticulum membranes, isolated using an antibody against calnexin, expressed immature γENaC, and the content decreased with Na depletion. Golgi membranes, isolated with an antibody against the cis-Golgi protein GM130, expressed both immature and processed γENaC; Na depletion increased the content of processed γENaC in this fraction by 3.8-fold. An endosomal compartment isolated using an antibody against Rab11 contained both immature and processed γENaC; the content of processed subunit increased 2.4-fold with Na depletion. Finally, we assessed the content of γENaC in the late endocytic compartments indirectly using urinary exosomes. All of the γENaC in these exosomes was in the fully cleaved form, and its content increased by 4.5-fold with Na depletion. These results imply that stimulation of ENaC surface expression results at least in part from increased rates of formation of fully processed subunits in the Golgi and subsequent trafficking to the apical membrane.

Identification of extracellular vesicle-borne periostin as a feature of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.	Oncotarget	2016	Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is an aggressive malignancy with high mortality, and heterogeneity in MIBC results in variable clinical outcomes, posing challenges for clinical management. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from MIBC have been shown to promote cancer progression. EVs derived from bladder cell lines were subjected to proteomic analysis, and periostin was chosen for further characterization due to its stage-specific gene expression profile. Knockdown of periostin by RNA interference reduces invasiveness in vitro and produces a rounder morphology. Importantly, treating low grade BC cells with periostin-rich EVs promotes cell aggressiveness and activates ERK oncogenic signals, and periostin suppression reverses these effects. These data suggest that MIBC might transfer periostin in an EV-mediated paracrine manner to promote the disease. To determine the potential of periostin as a bladder cancer indicator, patient urinary EVs were examined and found to have markedly higher levels of periostin than controls. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of a bladder cancer tissue microarray revealed that the presence of periostin in MIBC cells is correlated with worse prognosis. In conclusion, periostin is a component of bladder cancer cells associated with poor clinical outcome, and EVs can transfer oncogenic molecules such as periostin to affect the tumor environment and promote cancer progression.

Electronic address: .	thomas.tzelos@moredun.ac.uk		A preliminary proteomic characterisation of extracellular vesicles released by the ovine parasitic nematode, Teladorsagia circumcincta.	Vet Parasitol	2016	Teladorsagia circumcincta is a major cause of ovine parasitic gastroenteritis in temperate climatic regions. The development of high levels of anthelmintic resistance in this nematode species challenges its future control. Recent research indicates that many parasite species release extracellular vesicles into their environment, many of which have been classified as endocytic in origin, termed exosomes. These vesicles are considered to play important roles in the intercellular communication between parasites and their hosts, and thus represent potentially useful targets for novel control strategies. Here, we demonstrate that exosome-like extracellular vesicles can be isolated from excretory-secretory (ES) products released by T. circumcincta fourth stage larvae (Tci-L4ES). Furthermore, we perform a comparative proteomic analysis of vesicle-enriched and vesicle-free Tci-L4ES. Approximately 73% of the proteins identified in the vesicle-enriched fraction were unique to this fraction, whilst the remaining 27% were present in both vesicle-enriched and vesicle-free fraction. These unique proteins included structural proteins, nuclear proteins, metabolic proteins, proteolytic enzymes and activation-associated secreted proteins. Finally, we demonstrate that molecules present within the vesicles-enriched material are targets of the IgA and IgG response in T. circumcincta infected sheep, and could potentially represent useful targets for future vaccine intervention studies.

Extracellular microvesicle microRNAs in children with sickle cell anaemia with divergent clinical phenotypes.	Br J Haematol	2016	Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is the most frequent genetic haemoglobinopathy, which exhibits a highly variable clinical course characterized by hyper-coagulable and pro-inflammatory states, as well as endothelial dysfunction. Extracellular microvesicles are released into biological fluids and play a role in modifying the functional phenotype of target cells. We hypothesized that potential differences in plasma-derived extracellular microvesicles (EV) function and cargo from SCA patients may underlie divergent clinical trajectories. Plasma EV from SCA patients with mild, intermediate and severe clinical disease course were isolated, and primary endothelial cell cultures were exposed. Endothelial cell activation, monocyte adhesion, barrier disruption and exosome cargo (microRNA microarrays) were assessed. EV disrupted the endothelial barrier and induced expression of adhesion molecules and monocyte adhesion in a SCA severity-dependent manner compared to healthy children. Microarray approaches identified a restricted signature of exosomal microRNAs that readily distinguished severe from mild SCA, as well as from healthy children. The microRNA candidates were further validated using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assays, and revealed putative gene targets. Circulating exosomal microRNAs may play important roles in predicting the clinical course of SCA, and in delineation of individually tailored, mechanistically-based clinical treatment approaches of SCA patients in the near future.

FASEB J	2016	HIV-infected individuals have activated monocytes with an IFNα phenotype and elevated levels of circulating LPS. These individuals also have a risk of premature cardiovascular disease. The effect of activated monocyte exosomes (Exos) on endothelial cells is unknown. To determine whether Exos from immune-activated monocytes could alter endothelial cell expression and contribute to monocyte/macrophage transmigration and adhesion, we isolated Exos from monocytes stimulated with IFNα, LPS, or both (I/L). We show that monocyte Exos contain different inflammatory microRNA cargo depending on stimulation. When LPS Exos or I/L Exos were added to HUVECs, we found a significant increase in adhesion molecule ICAM-1, chemokine ligand (CCL)-2, and cytokine IL-6 mRNAs and proteins compared with cells treated with IFNα Exos or Exos derived from unstimulated monocytes. Inhibition of transcription factor NF-κB, a common inflammatory cytokine pathway, prevented induction of CCL2, IL6, and ICAM1 Inhibition of TLR4 resulted in differential blockage of the targets. Our results demonstrate for the first time that primary human monocyte Exos enter endothelial cells and cause dysfunction via the TLR4 and NF-κB pathways, which may contribute to heart disease in HIV infection and other diseases involving chronic immune activation.-Tang, N., Sun, B., Gupta, A., Rempel, H., Pulliam, L.

Milk miRNAs: simple nutrients or systemic functional regulators?	Nutr Metab (Lond)	2016	Milk is rich in miRNAs that appear to play important roles in the postnatal development of all mammals. Currently, two competing hypotheses exist: the functional hypothesis, which proposes that milk miRNAs are transferred to the offspring and exert physiological regulatory functions, and the nutritional hypothesis, which suggests that these molecules do not reach the systemic circulation of the milk recipient, but merely provide nutrition without conferring active regulatory signals to the offspring. The functional hypothesis is based on indirect evidence and requires further investigation. The nutritional hypothesis is primarily based on three mouse models, which are inherently problematic: 1) miRNA-375 KO mice, 2) miRNA-200c/141 KO mice, and 3) transgenic mice presenting high levels of miRNA-30b in milk. This article presents circumstantial evidence that these mouse models may all be inappropriate to study the physiological traffic of milk miRNAs to the newborn mammal, and calls for new studies using more relevant mouse models or human milk to address the fate and role of milk miRNAs in the offspring and the adult consumer of cow's milk.

Clin Cancer Res	2017	PURPOSE: To define the safety and effectiveness of T cells redirected against follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR)-expressing ovarian cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: FSHR expression was determined by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and qPCR in 77 human ovarian cancer specimens from 6 different histologic subtypes and 20 human healthy tissues. The effectiveness of human T cells targeted with full-length FSH in vivo was determined against a panel of patient-derived xenografts. Safety and effectiveness were confirmed in immunocompetent tumor-bearing mice, using constructs targeting murine FSHR and syngeneic T cells. RESULTS: FSHR is expressed in gynecologic malignancies of different histologic types but not in nonovarian healthy tissues. Accordingly, T cells expressing full-length FSHR-redirected chimeric receptors mediate significant therapeutic effects (including tumor rejection) against a panel of patient-derived tumors in vivo In immunocompetent mice growing syngeneic, orthotopic, and aggressive ovarian tumors, fully murine FSHR-targeted T cells also increased survival without any measurable toxicity. Notably, chimeric receptors enhanced the ability of endogenous tumor-reactive T cells to abrogate malignant progression upon adoptive transfer into naïve recipients subsequently challenged with the same tumor. Interestingly, FSHR-targeted T cells persisted as memory lymphocytes without noticeable PD-1-dependent exhaustion during end-stage disease, in the absence of tumor cell immunoediting. However, exosomes in advanced tumor ascites diverted the effector activity of this and other chimeric receptor-transduced T cells away from targeted tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: T cells redirected against FSHR+ tumor cells with full-length FSH represent a promising therapeutic alternative against a broad range of ovarian malignancies, with negligible toxicity even in the presence of cognate targets in tumor-free ovaries.

Transfus Apher Sci	2016	Blood has been shown to contain disease-associated misfolded prion protein (PrP(TSE)) in animals naturally and experimentally infected with various transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents, and in humans infected with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Recently, we have demonstrated PrP(TSE) in extracellular vesicle preparations (EVs) containing exosomes from plasma of mice infected with mouse-adapted vCJD by Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA). Here we report the detection of PrP(TSE) by PMCA in EVs from plasma of mice infected with Fukuoka-1 (FU), an isolate from a Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease patient. We used Tga20 transgenic mice that over-express mouse cellular prion protein, to assay by intracranial injections the level of infectivity in a FU-infected brain homogenate from wild-type mice (FU-BH), and in blood cellular components (BCC), consisting of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, plasma EVs, and plasma EVs subjected to multiple rounds of PMCA. Only FU-BH and plasma EVs from FU-infected mice subjected to PMCA that contained PrP(TSE) transmitted disease to Tga20 mice. Plasma EVs not subjected to PMCA and BCC from FU-infected mice failed to transmit disease. These findings confirm the high sensitivity of PMCA for PrP(TSE) detection in plasma EVs and the efficiency of this in vitro method to produce highly infectious prions. The results of our study encourage further research to define the role of EVs and, more specifically exosomes, as blood-borne carriers of PrP(TSE).

Int J Parasitol	2016	Recent studies have shown the importance of exosomes in the host-parasite relationship. These vesicles are an important part of the excretory/secretory pathway for proteins with the potential to alter immune responses. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the immunomodulatory role of exosomes in BALB/c mice using Echinostoma caproni as an experimental model of intestinal helminth infection. For this purpose, BALB/c mice were injected twice s.c. with purified exosomes of E. caproni, followed by experimental infection. We report a delay in the development of the parasite in mice immunised with exosomes, a concomitant reduced symptom severity and increased survival upon infection. Immunisations with exosomes evoked systemic antibody responses with high levels of IgM and IgG. IgG1, IgG2b and IgG3 are the subtypes responsible for the IgG increase. These antibodies showed specific recognition of exosomal proteins, indicating that these vesicles carry specific antigens that are involved in the humoral response. The administration of exosomes induced an increase of IFN-γ, IL-4 and TGF-β levels in the spleen of mice prior to infection. The subsequent infection with E. caproni resulted in a further increase of IL-4 and TGF-β, together with an abrupt overproduction of IL-10, suggesting the development of a Th2/Treg immune response. Our results show that the administration of exosomes primes the immune response in the host, which in turn can contribute to tolerance of the invader, reducing the severity of clinical signs in E. caproni infection.

Blood Cells Mol Dis	2016	Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been suggested as a precious source for generating functionally competent endothelial cells (ECs), candidate for various clinical applications. However, the paucity of these progenitor cells and the technical difficulties for their in vitro growth represent a main limitation to their use. In the present study we hypothesized that the paracrine effects of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) may improve endothelial cell generation from cord blood (CB) EPCs. In line with this hypothesis we showed that HUVEC conditioned medium (CM) or co-culture with HUVECs markedly improved the proliferation and differentiation and delayed the senescence of CB EPCs. The endothelial-promoting effect of CM seems to be related to smaller vesicles including exosomes (sEV/exo) contained in this medium and transferred to CB CD34(+) EPCs: in fact, purified preparations of sEV/exo isolated from CM mimicked the effect of CM to sustain endothelial formation. These observations provided the interesting indication that mature ECs exert a stimulatory effect on endothelial cell differentiation from CD34(+) cells.

J Neurooncol	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play key roles in glioblastoma (GBM) biology and represent novel sources of biomarkers that are detectable in the peripheral circulation. Despite this notionally non-invasive approach to assess GBM tumours in situ, a comprehensive GBM EV protein signature has not been described. Here, EVs secreted by six GBM cell lines were isolated and analysed by quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometry. Overall, 844 proteins were identified in the GBM EV proteome, of which 145 proteins were common to EVs secreted by all cell lines examined; included in the curated EV compendium (Vesiclepedia_559; http://microvesicles.org ). Levels of 14 EV proteins significantly correlated with cell invasion (invadopodia production; r2 > 0.5, p < 0.05), including several proteins that interact with molecules responsible for regulating invadopodia formation. Invadopodia, actin-rich membrane protrusions with proteolytic activity, are associated with more aggressive disease and are sites of EV release. Gene levels corresponding to invasion-related EV proteins showed that five genes (annexin A1, actin-related protein 3, integrin-β1, insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor and programmed cell death 6-interacting protein) were significantly higher in GBM tumours compared to normal brain in silico, with common functions relating to actin polymerisation and endosomal sorting. We also show that Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) washings are a novel source of brain tumour-derived EVs, demonstrated by particle tracking analysis, TEM and proteome profiling. Quantitative proteomics corroborated the high levels of proposed invasion-related proteins in EVs enriched from a GBM compared to low-grade astrocytoma tumour. Large-scale clinical follow-up of putative biomarkers, particularly the proposed survival marker annexin A1, is warranted.	PMC5306193

Front Microbiol	2016	Ebola virus (EBOV) is an enveloped, ssRNA virus from the family Filoviridae capable of causing severe hemorrhagic fever with up to 80-90% mortality rates. The most recent outbreak of EBOV in West Africa starting in 2014 resulted in over 11,300 deaths; however, long-lasting persistence and recurrence in survivors has been documented, potentially leading to further transmission of the virus. We have previously shown that exosomes from cells infected with HIV-1, HTLV-1 and Rift Valley Fever virus are able to transfer viral proteins and non-coding RNAs to naïve recipient cells, resulting in an altered cellular activity. In the current manuscript, we examined the effect of Ebola structural proteins VP40, GP, NP and VLPs on recipient immune cells, as well as the effect of exosomes containing these proteins on naïve immune cells. We found that VP40-transfected cells packaged VP40 into exosomes, and that these exosomes were capable of inducing apoptosis in recipient immune cells. Additionally, we show that presence of VP40 within parental cells or in exosomes delivered to naïve cells could result in the regulation of RNAi machinery including Dicer, Drosha, and Ago 1, which may play a role in the induction of cell death in recipient immune cells. Exosome biogenesis was regulated by VP40 in transfected cells by increasing levels of ESCRT-II proteins EAP20 and EAP45, and exosomal marker proteins CD63 and Alix. VP40 was phosphorylated by Cdk2/Cyclin complexes at Serine 233 which could be reversed with r-Roscovitine treatment. The level of VP40-containing exosomes could also be regulated by treated cells with FDA-approved Oxytetracycline. Additionally, we utilized novel nanoparticles to safely capture VP40 and other viral proteins from Ebola VLPs spiked into human samples using SDS/reducing agents, thus minimizing the need for BSL-4 conditions for most downstream assays. Collectively, our data indicates that VP40 packaged into exosomes may be responsible for the deregulation and eventual destruction of the T-cell and myeloid arms of the immune system (bystander lymphocyte apoptosis), allowing the virus to replicate to high titers in the immunocompromised host. Moreover, our results suggest that the use of drugs such as Oxytetracycline to modulate the levels of exosomes exiting EBOV-infected cells may be able to prevent the devastation of the adaptive immune system and allow for an improved rate of survival.

Additionally, platelets play key roles in arterial thrombosis and cancer progression. Given this plethora of functions, there is a strong interest of the role of platelet-derived (extracellular) vesicles (PDEVs) as functional mediators and biomarkers. Moreover, the majority of the blood-borne EVs are thought to originate from either platelets or directly from the platelet precursor cells, the megakaryocytes, which reside in the bone marrow. To circumvent confusion, we use the term PDEVs for both platelet-derived and/or megakaryocyte-derived EVs. PDEVs can be isolated from blood or from isolated platelets after activation. In this chapter, we describe all commonly used PDEV isolation methods from blood and prepurified platelets.

Exosomes as mediators of platinum resistance in ovarian cancer.	Oncotarget	2017	Exosomes have been implicated in the cell-cell transfer of oncogenic proteins and genetic material. We speculated this may be one mechanism by which an intrinsically platinum-resistant population of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells imparts its influence on surrounding tumor cells. To explore this possibility we utilized a platinum-sensitive cell line, A2780 and exosomes derived from its resistant subclones, and an unselected, platinum-resistant EOC line, OVCAR10. A2780 cells demonstrate a ~2-fold increase in viability upon treatment with carboplatin when pre-exposed to exosomes from platinum-resistant cells as compared to controls. This coincided with increased epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). DNA sequencing of EOC cell lines revealed previously unreported somatic mutations in the Mothers Against Decapentaplegic Homolog 4 (SMAD4) within platinum-resistant cells. A2780 cells engineered to exogenously express these SMAD4 mutations demonstrate up-regulation of EMT markers following carboplatin treatment, are more resistant to carboplatin, and release exosomes which impart a ~1.7-fold increase in resistance in naive A2780 recipient cells as compared to controls. These studies provide the first evidence that acquired SMAD4 mutations enhance the chemo-resistance profile of EOC and present a novel mechanism in which exchange of tumor-derived exosomes perpetuates an EMT phenotype, leading to the development of subpopulations of platinum-refractory cells.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts release exosomal microRNAs that dictate an aggressive phenotype in breast cancer.	Oncotarget	2017	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major components of the tumor microenvironment. They may drive tumor progression, although the mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. Exosomes have emerged as important mediators of intercellular communication in cancer. They mediate horizontal transfer of microRNAs (miRs), mRNAs and proteins, thus affecting breast cancer progression. Differential expression profile analysis identified three miRs (miRs -21, -378e, and -143) increased in exosomes from CAFs as compared from normal fibroblasts. Immunofluorescence indicated that exosomes may be transferred from CAFs to breast cancer cells, releasing their cargo miRs. Breast cancer cells (BT549, MDA-MB-231, and T47D lines) exposed to CAF exosomes or transfected with those miRs exhibited a significant increased capacity to form mammospheres, increased stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, and anchorage-independent cell growth. These effects were reverted by transfection with anti-miRs. Similarly to CAF exosomes, normal fibroblast exosomes transfected with miRs -21, -378e, and -143 promoted the stemness and EMT phenotype of breast cancer cells. Thus, we provided evidence for the first time of the role of CAF exosomes and their miRs in the induction of the stemness and EMT phenotype in different breast cancer cell lines. Indeed, CAFs strongly promote the development of an aggressive breast cancer cell phenotype.	PMC5386708

J Pediatr Surg	2017	BACKGROUND: Breast milk administration prevents necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). However, the mechanism remains unclear. Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles highly present in human milk and regulate intercellular signaling, inflammation, and immune response. We hypothesized that milk-derived exosomes beneficially affect intestinal epithelial cells. METHODS: Rat milk was collected, and exosomes were isolated using ExoQuick reagent and visualized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. Protein was extracted from encapsulating exosomes, and concentration was measured. 2×104 intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-18) were treated for five hours with 0.5-μg/μl exosomes, an equal volume of exosome-free milk, or control solution (PBS). IEC-18 viability was measured using a colorimetric assay (MTT), and gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Data were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. RESULTS: Rat milk was collected, and exosome isolation was confirmed. Compared to control, treatment with exosomes significantly increased IEC viability, proliferation, and stem cell activity (all p<0.05). However, administration of exosome-free milk had less significant effects. CONCLUSIONS: Rat milk-derived exosomes promote IEC viability, enhance proliferation, and stimulate intestinal stem cell activity. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of breast milk in the intestines. Exosome administration is a promising prevention method for infants at risk of developing NEC when breastfeeding is not tolerated.

Stem Cell Res Ther	2017	BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease worldwide. In the past decade, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used widely for the treatment of OA. A potential mechanism of MSC-based therapies has been attributed to the paracrine secretion of trophic factors, in which exosomes may play a major role. In this study, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of exosomes secreted by synovial membrane MSCs (SMMSC-Exos) and exosomes secreted by induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MSCs (iMSC-Exos) on the treatment of OA. METHODS: Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MSCs and synovial membrane MSCs were characterized by flow cytometry. iMSC-Exos and SMMSC-Exos were isolated using an ultrafiltration method. Tunable resistive pulse-sensing analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and western blots were used to identify exosomes. iMSC-Exos and SMMSC-Exos were injected intra-articularly in a mouse model of collagenase-induced OA and the efficacy of exosome injections was assessed by macroscopic, histological, and immunohistochemistry analysis. We also evaluated the effects of iMSC-Exos and SMMSC-Exos on proliferation and migration of human chondrocytes by cell-counting and scratch assays, respectively. RESULTS: The majority of iMSC-Exos and SMMSC-Exos were approximately 50-150 nm in diameter and expressed CD9, CD63, and TSG101. The injection of iMSC-Exos and SMMSC-Exos both attenuated OA in the mouse OA model, but iMSC-Exos had a superior therapeutic effect compared with SMMSC-Exos. Similarly, chondrocyte migration and proliferation were stimulated by both iMSC-Exos and SMMSC-Exos, with iMSC-Exos exerting a stronger effect. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that iMSC-Exos have a greater therapeutic effect on OA than SMMSC-Exos. Because autologous iMSCs are theoretically inexhaustible, iMSC-Exos may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of OA.	PMC5345222

Effects of embryo-derived exosomes on the development of bovine cloned embryos.	PLoS One	2017	The developmental competence of in vitro cultured (IVC) embryos is markedly lower than that of their in vivo counterparts, suggesting the need for optimization of IVC protocols. Embryo culture medium is routinely replaced three days after initial culture in bovine, however, whether this protocol is superior to continuous nonrenewal culture method under current conditions remains unclear. Using bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos as the model, our results showed that compared with routine renewal treatment, nonrenewal culture system significantly improved blastocyst formation, blastocyst quality (increased total cell number, decreased stress and apoptosis, enhanced Oct-4 expression and ratio of ICM/TE), as well as following development to term. Existence and function of SCNT embryo-derived exosomes were then investigated to reveal the cause of impaired development induced by culture medium replacement. Exosomes were successfully isolated through differential centrifugation and identified by both electron microscopy and immunostaining against exosomal membrane marker CD9. Supplementation of extracted exosomes into freshly renewed medium significantly rescued not only blastocyst formation and quality (in vitro development), but also following growth to term (in vivo development). Notably, ratio of ICM/TE and calving rate were enhanced to a similar level as that in nonrenewal group. In conclusion, our results for the first time indicate that 1: bovine SCNT embryos can secrete exosomes into chemically defined culture medium during IVC; 2: secreted exosomes are essential for SCNT blastocyst formation, blastocyst quality, and following development to term; 3: removal of exosomes induced by culture medium replacement impairs SCNT embryo development, which can be avoided by nonrenewal culture procedure or markedly recovered by exosome supplementation.

J Exp Clin Cancer Res	2017	BACKGROUND: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is frequently used to treat advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, the resistance often occurs with the mechanisms being not well understood. Recently, emerging evidence indicates that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an important role in chemoresistance of cancer. As the important mediators in intercellular communications, exosomes secreted by host cells mediate the exchange of genetic materials and proteins to be involved in tumor aggressiveness. The aim of the study was to investigate whether exosomes derived from TAMs mediate cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer. METHODS: M2 polarized macrophages were obtained from mouse bone marrow or human PBMCs stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13. Exosomes isolated from M2 macrophages culture medium were characterized, and miRNA expression profiles of M2 derived exosomes (M2-exos) were analyzed using miRNA microarray. In vitro cell coculture was further conducted to investigate M2-exos mediated crosstalk between TAMs and tumor cells. Moreover, the in vivo experiments were performed using a subcutaneous transplantation tumor model in athymic nude mice. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that M2 polarized macrophages promoted cisplatin (DDP) resistance in gastric cancer cells and exosomes derived from M2 macrophages (M2-exos) are involved in mediating the resistance to DDP. Using miRNA profiles assay, we identify significantly higher levels of microRNA-21 (miR21) isomiRNAs in exosomes and cell lysate isolated from M2 polarized macrophage. Functional studies revealed that exosomal miR-21 can be directly transferred from macrophages to the gastric cancer cells, where it suppresses cell apoptosis and enhances activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by down-regulation of PTEN. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that exosomal transfer of tumor-associated macrophages derived miR-21 confer DDP resistance in gastric cancer, and targeting exosome communication may be a promising new therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer patients.

Amyloid β-Exposed Human Astrocytes Overproduce Phospho-Tau and Overrelease It within Exosomes, Effects Suppressed by Calcilytic NPS 2143-Further Implications for Alzheimer's Therapy.	Front Neurosci	2017	The two main drivers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) oligomers, cooperatively accelerate AD progression, but a hot debate is still ongoing about which of the two appears first. Here we present preliminary evidence showing that Tau and p-Tau are expressed by untransformed cortical adult human astrocytes in culture and that exposure of such cells to an Aβ42 proxy, Aβ25-35, which binds the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and activates its signaling, significantly increases intracellular p-Tau levels, an effect CaSR antagonist (calcilytic) NPS 2143 wholly hinders. The astrocytes also release both Tau and p-Tau by means of exosomes into the extracellular medium, an activity that could mediate p-Tau diffusion within the brain. Preliminary data also indicate that exosomal levels of p-Tau increase after Aβ25-35 exposure, but remain unchanged in cells pre-treated for 30-min with NPS 2143 before adding Aβ25-35. Thus, our previous and present findings raise the unifying prospect that Aβ•CaSR signaling plays a crucial role in AD development and progression by simultaneously activating (i) the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor holoprotein, whose upshot is a surplus production and secretion of Aβ42 oligomers, and (ii) the GSK-3β-mediated increased production of p-Tau oligomers which are next released extracellularly inside exosomes. Therefore, as calcilytics suppress both effects on Aβ42 and p-Tau metabolic handling, these highly selective antagonists of pathological Aβ•CaSR signaling would effectively halt AD's progressive spread preserving patients' cognition and life quality.

Electronic address: .	zhangruixx2015@sina.com		Serum long non coding RNA MALAT-1 protected by exosomes is up-regulated and promotes cell proliferation and migration in non-small cell lung cancer.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2017	Circulating lncRNAs have been defined as a novel biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MALAT-1 was first identified lncRNA that was related to lung cancer metastasis. However, the relationship between exosomal lncRNAs and the diagnosis and prognosis of NSCLC was poorly understood. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of serum exosomal MALAT-1 as a biomarker in the metastasis of NSCLC. In this study, we firstly isolated the exosomes from healthy subjects and NSCLC patients. Then we measured the expression levels of MALAT-1 contained in exosomes, and found that exosomal MALAT-1 was highly expressed in NSCLC patients, more importantly, the levels of exosomal MALAT-1 were positively associated with tumor stage and lymphatic metastasis. In addition, we decreased MALAT-1 expression by short hairpin RNA and conducted a series of assays including MTT, cell cycle, colony formation, wound-healing scratch and Annexin/V PI by flow cytometry in human lung cancer cell lines. These in vitro studies demonstrated that serum exosome-derived long noncoding RNA MALAT-1 promoted the tumor growth and migration, and prevented tumor cells from apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines. Taken together, this study shed a light on utilizing MALAT-1 in exosomes as a non-invasive serum-based tumor biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of NSCLC.

Rapid Isolation and Detection of Exosomes and Associated Biomarkers from Plasma.	ACS Nano	2017	Exosomes found in the circulation are a primary source of important cancer-related RNA and protein biomarkers that are expected to lead to early detection, liquid biopsy, and point-of-care diagnostic applications. Unfortunately, due to their small size (50-150 nm) and low density, exosomes are extremely difficult to isolate from plasma. Current isolation methods are time-consuming multistep procedures that are unlikely to translate into diagnostic applications. To address this issue, we demonstrate the ability of an alternating current electrokinetic (ACE) microarray chip device to rapidly isolate and recover glioblastoma exosomes from undiluted human plasma samples. The ACE device requires a small plasma sample (30-50 μL) and is able to concentrate the exosomes into high-field regions around the ACE microelectrodes within 15 min. A simple buffer wash removes bulk plasma materials, leaving the exosomes concentrated on the microelectrodes. The entire isolation process and on-chip fluorescence analysis is completed in less than 30 min which enables subsequent on-chip immunofluorescence detection of exosomal proteins, and provides viable mRNA for RT-PCR analysis. These results demonstrate the ability of the ACE device to streamline the process for isolation and recovery of exosomes, significantly reducing the number of processing steps and time required.

Sci Rep	2017	Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from an autoimmune attack against the insulin-producing ß cells which leads to chronic hyperglycemia. Exosomes are lipid vesicles derived from cellular multivesicular bodies that are enriched in specific miRNAs, potentially providing a disease-specific diagnostic signature. To assess the value of exosome miRNAs as biomarkers for T1DM, miRNA expression in plasma-derived exosomes was measured. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of plasma-derived exosomes (EXOs) isolated by differential centrifugation. Total RNA extracted from plasma-derived EXOs of 12 T1DM and 12 control subjects was hybridized onto Nanostring human v2 miRNA microarray array and expression data were analyzed on nSolver analysis software. We found 7 different miRNAs (1 up-regulated and 6 down-regulated), that were differentially expressed in T1DM. The selected candidate miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR analysis of cohorts of 24 T1DM and 24 control subjects. Most of the deregulated miRNAs are involved in progression of T1DM. These findings highlight the potential of EXOs miRNA profiling in the diagnosis as well as new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in T1DM.	PMC5519761

Clinical implications of carcinoembryonic antigen distribution in serum exosomal fraction-Measurement by ELISA.	PLoS One	2017	BACKGROUND: Serum exosomal proteins have great potential as indicators of disease status in cancer, inflammatory or metabolic diseases. The association of a fraction of various serum proteins such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) with circulating exosomes has been debated. The establishment of a method to measure the exosomal fraction of such proteins might help resolve this controversy. The use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to measure serum exosomal molecules, for example CEA, is rare in research laboratories and totally absent in clinical biology. In this study, we optimized a method for assessment of serum exosomal molecules combining a treatment by volume-excluding polymers to isolate the exosomes, their subsequent solubilization in an assay buffer and ELISA. METHODS: One hundred sixteen consecutive patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled for this study between June 2015 and June 2016 at Wakayama Medical University Hospital (WMUH). Whole blood samples were collected from patients during surgery. Exosomes were isolated using the ExoQuick reagent, solubilized in an assay buffer and subjected to CEA detection by ELISA. The procedure of serum exosome isolation and the formulation of the assay buffer used for the ELISA were optimized in order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. RESULTS: A five-fold increase in the concentration of the exosomes in the assay buffer (using initial serum volume as a reference) and the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) resulted in more accurate measurements of the serum exosomal CEA. The thawing temperature of frozen serum samples before exosome extraction was also optimized. A validation study that included one hundred sixteen patients with colorectal cancer demonstrated that serum exosomal CEA from samples thawed at 25°C exhibited a better AUC value, sensitivity, and specificity as well as a more correct classification than serum CEA. CONCLUSIONS: We optimized an easy and rapid detection method for assessment of serum exosomal CEA. The thawing temperature of frozen serum prior to exosome extraction, the formulation of the assay buffer used for exosome solubilization and the concentration of the exosomes in this buffer were fine-tuned to enable the appropriate and accurate measurement of serum exosomal CEA.

Upregulated exosomic miR‑23b‑3p plays regulatory roles in the progression of pancreatic cancer.	Oncol Rep	2017	Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal malignances. Identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis of PC is a key imperative. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be valuable biomarkers in the context of several cancers. Exosomes refer to vesicles released by the tumor cells at the early stage of disease. Thus, detection of miRNA in exosomes can be used as a potential biomarker for PC. In this study, we profiled serum levels of miRNAs in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and PC; the role of miR‑23b‑3p in PC progression was assessed in vitro. Additionally, we assessed, the expression of miR‑23b‑3p in exosomes isolated from serum samples and assessed the correlation between the expression of miR‑23b‑3p and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). Three serum samples each were randomly selected from healthy controls (n=20), and patients with CP (n=18) and PC (n=16) for miRNA microarray profiling. The dysregulated miRNAs were confirmed using qRT‑PCR. Four dysregulated miRNAs common to patients with CP and PC were identified on miRNA microarray analysis and confirmed by qRT‑PCR. miR‑23b‑3p level was consistently higher in serum samples from PC patients as compared to those from healthy controls and CP patients (p<0.05). Overexpression of miR‑23b‑3p promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion capability of PC cells in vitro (p<0.05). Furthermore, miR‑23b‑3p was upregulated in exosomes of PC serum samples and the supernatant of pancreatic cancer cells (PANC‑1), and the expression levels of miR‑23b‑3p were associated with those of serum CA19-9 levels. This study provides insights into the potential role of miR‑23b‑3p as a novel biomarker and target for treatment of PC.	PMC5652966

UBR2 Enriched in p53 Deficient Mouse Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Exosome Promoted Gastric Cancer Progression via Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway.	Stem Cells	2017	The deficiency or mutation of p53 has been linked to several types of cancers. The mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) is an important component in the tumor microenvironment, and exosomes secreted by MSCs can transfer bioactive molecules, including proteins and nucleic acid, to other cells in the tumor microenvironment to influence the progress of a tumor. However, whether the state of p53 in MSCs can impact the bioactive molecule secretion of exosomes to promote cancer progression and the regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Our study aimed to investigate the regulation of ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 2 (UBR2) enriched in exosomes secreted by p53 deficient mouse bone marrow MSC (p53-/- mBMMSC) in gastric cancer progression in vivo and in vitro. We found that the concentration of exosome was significantly higher in p53-/- mBMMSC than that in p53 wild-type mBMMSC (p53+/+ mBMMSC). In particular, UBR2 was highly expressed in p53-/- mBMMSC cells and exosomes. P53-/- mBMMSC exosomes enriched UBR2 could be internalized into p53+/+ mBMMSC and murine foregastric carcinoma (MFC) cells and induce the overexpression of UBR2 in these cells which elevated cell proliferation, migration, and the expression of stemness-related genes. Mechanistically, the downregulation of UBR2 in p53-/- mBMMSC exosomes could reverse these actions. Moreover, a majority of Wnt family members, β-catenin, and its downstream genes (CD44, CyclinD1, CyclinD3, and C-myc) were significantly decreased in MFC knockdown UBR2 and β-catenin depletion, an additional depletion of UBR2 had no significant difference in the expression of Nanog, OCT4, Vimentin, and E-cadherin. Taken together, our findings indicated that p53-/- mBMMSC exosomes could deliver UBR2 to target cells and promote gastric cancer growth and metastasis by regulating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles from a Plasmodium falciparum Kenyan clinical isolate defines a core parasite secretome.	Wellcome Open Res	2017	BACKGROUND: Many pathogens secrete effector molecules to subvert host immune responses, to acquire nutrients, and/or to prepare host cells for invasion. One of the ways that effector molecules are secreted is through extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes. Recently, the malaria parasite P. falciparum has been shown to produce EVs that can mediate transfer of genetic material between parasites and induce sexual commitment. Characterizing the content of these vesicles may improve our understanding of P. falciparum pathogenesis and virulence. METHODS: Previous studies of P. falciparum EVs have been limited to long-term adapted laboratory isolates. In this study, we isolated EVs from a Kenyan P. falciparum clinical isolate adapted to in vitro culture for a short period and characterized their protein content by mass spectrometry (data are available via ProteomeXchange, with identifier PXD006925). RESULTS: We show that P. falciparum extracellular vesicles ( PfEVs) are enriched in proteins found within the exomembrane compartments of infected erythrocytes such as Maurer's clefts (MCs), as well as the secretory endomembrane compartments in the apical end of the merozoites, suggesting that these proteins play a role in parasite-host interactions. Comparison of this novel clinically relevant dataset with previously published datasets helps to define a core secretome present in Plasmodium EVs. CONCLUSIONS: P. falciparum extracellular vesicles contain virulence-associated parasite proteins. Therefore, analysis of PfEVs contents from a range of clinical isolates, and their functional validation may improve our understanding of the virulence mechanisms of the parasite, and potentially identify targets for interventions or diagnostics.

Stem Cell Rev	2018	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are considered a source of bioactive molecules that modulate their microenvironment by acting on intercellular communication. Either intracellular endosomal machinery or their derived EVs have been considered a relevant system of signal circuits processing. Herein, we show that these features are found in mESCs. Ultrastructural analysis revealed structures and organelles of the endosomal system such as coated pits and endocytosis-related vesicles, prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) containing either few or many intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that could be released as exosomes to extracellular milieu. Besides, budding vesicles shed from the plasma membrane to the extracellular space is suggestive of microvesicle biogenesis in mESCs. mESCs and mouse blastocyst express specific markers of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) system. Ultrastructural analysis and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) of isolated EVs revealed a heterogeneous population of exosomes and microvesicles released by mESCs. These vesicles contain Wnt10b and the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (DLL4) and also the co-chaperone stress inducible protein 1 (STI1) and its partner Hsp90. Wnt10b and Dll4 colocalize with EVs biogenesis markers in mESCs. Overall, the present study supports the function of the mESCs endocytic network and their EVs as players in stem cell biology.

Sci Rep	2017	Exosomes, small (30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from plasma of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) carry leukemia-associated antigens and multiple inhibitory molecules. Circulating exosomes can deliver suppressive cargos to immune recipient cells, inhibiting anti-tumor activities. Pre-therapy plasma of refractory/relapsed AML patients contains elevated levels of immunosuppressive exosomes which interfere with anti-leukemia functions of activated immune cells. We show that exosomes isolated from pre-therapy plasma of the AML patients receiving adoptive NK-92 cell therapy block anti-leukemia cytotoxicity of NK-92 cells and other NK-92 cell functions. NK-92 cells do not internalize AML exosomes. Instead, signaling via surface receptors expressed on NK-92 cells, AML exosomes simultaneously deliver multiple inhibitory ligands to the cognate receptors. The signals are processed downstream and activate multiple suppressive pathways in NK-92 cells. AML exosomes reprogram NK-92 cells, interfering with their anti-leukemia functions and reducing the therapeutic potential of adoptive cell transfers. Plasma-derived exosomes interfere with immune cells used for adoptive cell therapy and may limit expected therapeutic benefits of adoptive cell therapy.	PMC5666018

Sci Rep	2017	Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs), released by a wide variety of cell types, carry donor origin-proteins, cytokines, and nucleic acids, transport these cargos to adjacent or distant specific recipient cells, and thereby regulate gene expression and activation of target cells. In this study, we isolated and identified exosomes in rhesus macaques, and investigated their effects on cell tropism and activation, especially their potential to reactivate HIV latency. The results indicated that plasma-derived exosomes preferentially fuse to TCR-activated T cells and autologous parent cells. Importantly, the uptake of exosomes, derived from IL-2 stimulated CD4+ T cells, effectively promoted reactivation of resting CD4+ T-cell, as indicated by an increased viral transcription rate in these cells. These findings provide premise for the potential application of exosome in the reactivation of HIV latency, in combination its use as functional delivery vehicles with antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2018	Exosomes, extracellular vesicles, are present in uterine flushing fluids (UFs), which are involved in conceptus-endometrial interactions during peri-implantation periods. Despite several studies on intrauterine exosomes conducted, the roles conceptus and endometrial exosomes play during peri-implantation periods have not been well characterized. To investigate the effect of bovine intrauterine exosomes on conceptus implantation, exosomes isolated from bovine UFs during peri-implantation periods were subjected to global protein analysis. The analysis detected 596 exosomal proteins, including ruminants' pregnancy recognition factor IFNT, and 172 differentially expressed proteins with more than 1.5-fold changes in UFs on days 17, 20 and 22 pregnancy (day of conceptus implantation is initiated on days 19-19.5). Treatment of primary bovine endometrial epithelial cells with exosomes from day 17 UFs up-regulated the expression of apoptosis-related genes, and treatment with exosomes from day 20 and 22 UFs up-regulated the expression of adhesion molecule. Based on these findings, intrauterine exosomes should be considered as an essential constituent for successful implantation.

Stem Cell Ophthalmology Treatment Study: bone marrow derived stem cells in the treatment of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).	Stem Cell Investig	2017	Background: Ten patients with bilateral visual loss due to sequential non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) underwent autologous Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cell (BMSC) therapy within the Stem Cell Ophthalmology Treatment Study (SCOTS). SCOTS is an Institutional Review Board approved clinical study utilizing autologous BMSC in the treatment of optic nerve and retinal diseases that meet inclusion criteria. Methods: The average age of the patients treated was 69.8 years. The average duration of visual loss in eyes treated was 9.8 years and ranged from 1 to 35 years. Affected eyes were treated with either retrobulbar, subtenons and intravenous BMSC or, following vitrectomy, intra-optic nerve, subtenons and intravenous BMSC. The primary outcome was visual acuity as measured by Snellen or converted to LogMAR. Results: Following therapy in SCOTS, 80% of patients experienced improvement in Snellen binocular vision (P=0.029) with 20% remaining stable; 73.6% of eyes treated gained vision (P=0.019) and 15.9% remained stable in the post-operative period. There was an average of 3.53 Snellen lines of vision improvement per eye with an average 22.74% and maximum 83.3% improvement in LogMAR acuity per eye. The average LogMAR change in treated eyes was a gain of 0.364 (P=0.0089). Improvements typically manifested no later than 6 months post procedure. Conclusions: The use of BMSC in the Stem Cell Ophthalmology Treatment Study achieved meaningful visual improvements in a significant percentage of the NAION patients reported. Improvements typically manifested no later than 6 months post-procedure. Duration of visual loss did not appear to affect the ability of the eyes to respond to treatment. Possible mechanisms by which visual improvement occurred may include BMSC paracrine secretion of proteins and hormones, transfer of mitochondria, release of messenger RNA or other compounds via exosomes or microvesicles and neuronal transdifferentiation of the stem cells.

Modulation of miR-26a-5p and miR-15b-5p Exosomal Expression Associated with Clopidogrel-Induced Hepatotoxicity in HepG2 Cells.	Front Pharmacol	2017	Clopidogrel is an essential antiplatelet drug used to prevent thrombosis complications associated with atherosclerosis. However, hepatotoxicity is a potential adverse effect related to clopidogrel therapy. Exosome-derived miRNAs may be useful for improved monitoring of drug response and hepatotoxicity risk. In the present study, the expression of several exosomal miRNAs (miR-26a-5p, miR-145-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-4701-3p) and cell-derived mRNA targets (PLOD2, SENP5, EIF4G2, HMGA2, STRADB, and TLK1) were evaluated in HepG2 cells treated with clopidogrel (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μM) for 24 and 48 h. Then, clopidogrel cytotoxicity was evaluated by analyzing DNA fragmentation and the cell cycle profile using flow cytometry. Differential expression of exosome-derived miRNAs and cell-derived mRNAs was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Exposure of HepG2 cells to high concentrations of clopidogrel (50 and 100 μM) for 24 h caused significant DNA fragmentation (17.6 and 44.4%, respectively; p < 0.05) and 48 h (26.8 and 48.9%, respectively; p < 0.05), indicating cellular toxicity. Upregulation of miR-26a-5p and downregulation of miR-15b-5p was observed in cells exposed to 100 μM clopidogrel for 24 and 48 h. The miR-26a-5p target mRNAs HMGA2, EIF4G2, STRADB, and SENP5 were downregulated in HepG2 cells following exposure to cytotoxic concentrations of clopidogrel (50 and 100 μM) for 24 h, and HMGA2 levels remained low after 48 h of treatment. TLK1, a target of miR-15b-5p, was downregulated by 50 and 100 μM clopidogrel at 24 h. In conclusion, our results suggest that exposure to high concentrations of clopidogrel modulates the expression of exosomal miR-26a-5p and miR-15b-5p and their target mRNAs in HepG2 cells. Dysregulation of these miRNAs maybe modulate the regulatory pathways involved in clopidogrel-induced liver injury.	PMC5733064

Dosage and Passage Dependent Neuroprotective Effects of Exosomes Derived from Rat Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells: An In Vitro Analysis.	Curr Gene Ther	2017	BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases comprise a group of disorders for which no treatment is available till date. Stem cell based therapy offers great hope and promise. However, stem cell transplantation is associated with certain disadvantages like poor targeted migration, engraftment and survival of the transplanted cells. MATERIAL & METHOD: Exosomes, a type of extracellular membrane vesicle released by all cell types including stem cells, offer an alternative to stem cell transplantation. Exosome carry a wide array of biomolecules and are implicated in exhibiting substantial benefits in the repair/regeneration of the injured tissue. Thus, exosomes offer an alternative therapeutic approach as a substitute of cell transplantation. In order to utilize exosomes for therapeutic purpose, it is essential to evaluate the appropriate passage number and the dosage to avoid possible cytotoxic effects. Here, we isolated exosomes from different passages of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) and analysed the neuroprotective potential of BM-MSC exosomes in an in vitro model of excitotoxicity. RESULT: Our results demonstrated that the exosomes isolated from early passage of rat BM-MSC exhibited more efficient neuroprotective potential as opposed to later passages derived exosomes. Furthermore, the neuroprotective efficacy of exosome is dosage dependent. i.e. the lower dosage of exosomes was found to be neuroprotective, whereas higher dosage of exosomes (from later passages) was found to be detrimental to neurons. The early passage derived exosomes protected neurons through anti-apoptotic, anti-necrotic and anti-oxidant mechanisms. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that adult stem cells derived exosomes could be a potential therapeutic agent to confer neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease.

Exosomes as secondary inductive signals involved in kidney organogenesis.	J Extracell Vesicles	2018	The subfraction of extracellular vesicles, called exosomes, transfers biological molecular information not only between cells but also between tissues and organs as nanolevel signals. Owing to their unique properties such that they contain several RNA species and proteins implicated in kidney development, exosomes are putative candidates to serve as developmental programming units in embryonic induction and tissue interactions. We used the mammalian metanephric kidney and its nephron-forming mesenchyme containing the nephron progenitor/stem cells as a model to investigate if secreted exosomes could serve as a novel type of inductive signal in a process defined as embryonic induction that controls organogenesis. As judged by several characteristic criteria, exosomes were enriched and purified from a cell line derived from embryonic kidney ureteric bud (UB) and from primary embryonic kidney UB cells, respectively. The cargo of the UB-derived exosomes was analysed by qPCR and proteomics. Several miRNA species that play a role in Wnt pathways and enrichment of proteins involved in pathways regulating the organization of the extracellular matrix as well as tissue homeostasis were identified. When labelled with fluorescent dyes, the uptake of the exosomes by metanephric mesenchyme (MM) cells and the transfer of their cargo to the cells can be observed. Closer inspection revealed that besides entering the cytoplasm, the exosomes were competent to also reach the nucleus. Furthermore, fluorescently labelled exosomal RNA enters into the cytoplasm of the MM cells. Exposure of the embryonic kidney-derived exosomes to the whole MM in an ex vivo organ culture setting did not lead to an induction of nephrogenesis but had an impact on the overall organization of the tissue. We conclude that the exosomes provide a novel signalling system with an apparent role in secondary embryonic induction regulating organogenesis.	PMC5795705

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2018	Exosomes are membrane-bound, virus-sized vesicles present in circulating blood. Tumor cells are avid producers of exosomes, which are thought to mimic molecular features of parent tumor cells. T-cell immunoglobulin- and mucin-domain-containing molecule 3 (Tim-3) is a the next-generation immune checkpoint that can be activated by its ligand Galectin-9 to negatively regulate the anti-tumor immune response. However, the characteristics of plasma exosomal Tim-3 and Galectin-9 (Exo-T/G) in cancer remained unknown. This study was conducted to investigate the expression patterns and clinical value of plasma exosomal total protein (Exo-pro) and Exo-T/G in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Plasma was collected from 103 NSCLC patients including 60 early stages and 43 advanced stages disease samples as well as 56 healthy subjects. Exosomes were isolated from plasma by commercial exosome precipitation solution and identified by western blotting of CD63 and transmission electron microscopy. Exo-pro concentration was measured by the BCA assay. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify Exo-T/G. Additionally, 34 NSCLC samples were applied to directly detect plasma TIM-3 (Plas-T) and Galectin-9 (Plas-G). Our results showed that Exo-pro, Exo-T, and Exo-G were significantly increased in NSCLC plasma compared to that in the healthy samples. High levels of Exo-T and Exo-G were all positively correlated with several malignant parameters, including larger tumor size, advanced stages, and more distant metastasis. High levels of Exo-pro and Exo-T were also correlated with more lymph node metastasis. Additionally, plasma from lung squamous cell carcinoma showed higher Exo-T and Exo-G compared with that from lung adenocarcinoma. ALK-positive patients showed to have decreased Exo-T and Exo-G levels. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between Exo-pro and Exo-T/G, Exo-T and Exo-G, Exo-T and Plas-T, Exo-G and Plas-G, and Plas-T and Plas-G. Together, our data revealed that Exo-pro, especially Exo-T and Exo-G could be potential biomarkers for NSCLC. Further studies focusing on pure tumor-derived exosomes isolated from plasma were needed.

Serum exosomes can restore cellular function in vitro and be used for diagnosis in dysferlinopathy.	Theranostics	2018	Purpose: It is challenging to deliver the full-length dysferlin gene or protein to restore cellular functions of dysferlin-deficient (DYSF-/-) myofibres in dysferlinopathy, a disease caused by the absence of dysferlin, which is currently without effective treatment. Exosomes, efficient membranous nanoscale carriers of biological cargoes, could be useful. Experimental design: Myotube- and human serum-derived exosomes were investigated for their capabilities of restoring dysferlin protein and cellular functions in murine and human DYSF-/- cells. Moreover, dysferlinopathic patient serum- and urine-derived exosomes were assessed for their abilities as diagnostic tools for dysferlinopathy. Results: Here we show that exosomes from dysferlin-expressing myotubes carry abundant dysferlin and enable transfer of full-length dysferlin protein to DYSF-/- myotubes. Exogenous dysferlin correctly localizes on DYSF-/- myotube membranes, enabling membrane resealing in response to injury. Human serum exosomes also carry dysferlin protein and improve membrane repair capabilities of human DYSF-/- myotubes irrespective of mutations. Lack of dysferlin in dysferlinopathic patient serum and urine exosomes enables differentiation between healthy controls and dysferlinopathic patients.

Methods Mol Biol	2018	Exosomes are small (30-150 nm) vesicles of endosomal origin secreted by most cell types. Exosomes contain proteins, lipids, and RNA species including microRNA, mRNA, rRNA, and long noncoding RNAs. The mechanisms associated with exosome synthesis and cargo loading are still poorly understood. A role for exosomes in intercellular communication has been reported in physiological and pathological conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Previous studies have suggested that Schwann cell-derived exosomes regulate neuronal functions, but the mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we describe protocols to establish rat neonatal Schwann cell cultures and to isolate exosomes from the conditioned medium of these cultures by differential ultracentrifugation. To analyze the RNA content of Schwann cell-derived exosomes, we detail protocols for RNA extraction and next-generation sequencing using miRNA and mRNA libraries. The protocol also includes RNA sequencing of Schwann cells, which allows the comparison between RNA content from cells and the secreted exosomes. Identification of RNAs present in Schwann cell-derived exosomes is a valuable tool to understand novel roles of Schwann cells in neuronal function in health and disease.

Mol Ther	2018	Microvascular dysfunction leads to multi-organ failure and mortality in sepsis. Our previous studies demonstrated that administration of exogenous endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) confers protection in sepsis as evidenced by reduced vascular leakage, improved organ function, and increased survival. We hypothesize that EPCs protect the microvasculature through the exosomes-mediated transfer of microRNAs (miRNAs). Mice were rendered septic by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and EPC exosomes were administered intravenously at 4 hr after CLP. EPC exosomes treatment improved survival, suppressing lung and renal vascular leakage, and reducing liver and kidney dysfunction in septic mice. EPC exosomes attenuated sepsis-induced increases in plasma levels of cytokines and chemokine. Moreover, we determined miRNA contents of EPC exosomes with next-generation sequencing and found abundant miR-126-3p and 5p. We demonstrated that exosomal miR-126-5p and 3p suppressed LPS-induced high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) levels, respectively, in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs). Inhibition of microRNA-126-5p and 3p through transfection with microRNA-126-5p and 3p inhibitors abrogated the beneficial effect of EPC exosomes. The inhibition of exosomal microRNA-126 failed to block LPS-induced increase in HMGB1 and VCAM1 protein levels in HMVECs and negated the protective effect of exosomes on sepsis survival. Thus, EPC exosomes prevent microvascular dysfunction and improve sepsis outcomes potentially through the delivery of miR-126.

Electronic address: .	13720086335@163.com		Adipose mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes stimulated by hydrogen peroxide enhanced skin flap recovery in ischemia-reperfusion injury.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2018	BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes have been recognized as new candidates for the treatment of ischemic disease or injury and may be an alternative treatment for cell therapy. This aim of the study was to evaluate whether exosomes derived from adipose mesenchymal stem cell (ADSC) can protect the skin flap during ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and induce neovascularization. METHODS: To investigate the effects of exosomes in the I/R injury of flap transplantation in vivo, flaps were subjected to 6 h of ischemia by ligating the left superficial inferior epigastric vessels (SIEA) followed by blood perfusion. Exosomes derived from normal ADSC (ADSC-exos) and exosomes derived from ADSC preconditioned with H2O2 (H2O2-ADSC-exos) were injected into the flaps. Then, the blood perfusion unit (BPU) of the flaps was measured by Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging (LDPI) and microvessel density was determined by the endothelial with cell marker CD31 with Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Inflammatory cell infiltration of the skin flap and apoptosis were detected by hematoxylin & eosin staining (H&E) and the TdT-mediated biotinylated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) technique. RESULTS: In vivo, exosomes significantly increased flap survival and capillary density compared to I/R on postoperative day 5, and decreased the inflammatory reaction and apoptosis in the skin flap (P < 0.05). Furthermore, H2O2-ADSC-exos had better outcomes compared to normal exosomes (P < 0.05). ADSC-exos could significantly increase human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation (P < 0.05), but no statistic difference was found in exosomes derived from different microenvironments (P > 0.05). HUVEC co-cultured with H2O2-ADSC-exos increased the migration ratio and generated more cord-like structures compared to ADSC-exos and the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ADSC-exos can enhance skin flap survival, promote neovascularization and alleviate the inflammation reaction and apoptosis in the skin flap after I/R injury. The use of a specific microenvironment for in vitro stem cell culture, such as one containing a low concentration of H2O2, will facilitate the development of customized exosomes for cell-free therapeutic applications in skin flap transplantation.

Therapeutic effects of serum extracellular vesicles in liver fibrosis.	J Extracell Vesicles	2018	The lack of approved therapies for hepatic fibrosis seriously limits medical management of patients with chronic liver disease. Since extracellular vesicles (EVs) function as conduits for intercellular molecular transfer, we investigated if EVs from healthy individuals have anti-fibrotic properties. Hepatic fibrogenesis or fibrosis in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)- or thioacetic acid-induced liver injury models in male or female mice were suppressed by serum EVs from normal mice (EVN) but not from fibrotic mice (EVF). CCl4-treated mice undergoing EVN therapy also exhibited reduced levels of hepatocyte death, inflammatory infiltration, circulating AST/ALT levels and hepatic or circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Hepatic histology, liver function tests or circulating proinflammatory cytokine levels were unaltered in control mice receiving EVN. As determined using PKH26-labelled EVN, principal target cells included hepatic stellate cells (HSC; a normally quiescent fibroblastic cell that undergoes injury-induced activation and produces fibrosis during chronic injury) or hepatocytes which showed increased EVN binding after, respectively, activation or exposure to CCl4. In vitro, EVN decreased proliferation and fibrosis-associated molecule expression in activated HSC, while reversing the inhibitory effects of CCl4 or ethanol on hepatocyte proliferation. In mice, microRNA-34c, -151-3p, -483-5p, -532-5p and -687 were more highly expressed in EVN than EVF and mimics of these microRNAs (miRs) individually suppressed fibrogenic gene expression in activated HSC. A role for these miRs in contributing to EVN actions was shown by the ability of their corresponding antagomirs to individually and/or collectively block the therapeutic effects of EVN on activated HSC or injured hepatocytes. Similarly, the activated phenotype of human LX-2 HSC was attenuated by serum EVs from healthy human subjects and contained higher miR-34c, -151-3p, -483-5p or -532-5p than EVs from hepatic fibrosis patients. In conclusion, serum EVs from normal healthy individuals are inherently anti-fibrogenic and anti-fibrotic, and contain microRNAs that have therapeutic actions in activated HSC or injured hepatocytes.

Sci Rep	2018	Exosomes are nanovesicles released from most cell types including immune cells. Prior studies suggest exosomes play a role in HIV pathogenesis, but little is known about exosome cargo in relation to immune responses and oxidative stress. Here, we characterize plasma exosomes in HIV patients and their relationship to immunological and oxidative stress markers. Plasma exosome fractions were isolated from HIV-positive subjects on ART with suppressed viral load and HIV-negative controls. Exosomes were characterized by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking, immunoblotting, and LC-MS/MS proteomics. Plasma exosomes were increased in HIV-positive subjects compared to controls, and correlated with increased oxidative stress markers (cystine, oxidized cys-gly) and decreased PUFA (DHA, EPA, DPA). Untargeted proteomics detected markers of exosomes (CD9, CD63, CD81), immune activation (CD14, CRP, HLA-A, HLA-B), oxidative stress (CAT, PRDX1, PRDX2, TXN), and Notch4 in plasma exosomes. Exosomal Notch4 was increased in HIV-positive subjects versus controls and correlated with immune activation markers. Treatment of THP-1 monocytic cells with patient-derived exosomes induced expression of genes related to interferon responses and immune activation. These results suggest that exosomes in ART-treated HIV patients carry proteins related to immune activation and oxidative stress, have immunomodulatory effects on myeloid cells, and may have pro-inflammatory and redox effects during pathogenesis.

Electronic address: .	wangxh@bjsjth.cn		Development a hydrazide-functionalized thermosensitive polymer based homogeneous system for highly efficient N-glycoprotein/glycopeptide enrichment from human plasma exosome.	Talanta	2018	As one of the most common post-translational modifications, protein N-glycosylation precipitates in many important biological processes and has closely correlations with the occurrence and progression of multiple diseases. Plasma exosomes secreted by cells contain various bioactive N-glycoproteins which may serve as potential biomarkers for early disease diagnosis and treatment. However, the protein N-glycosylation profile in human plasma exosome is largely unknown, due to the technical challenges in glycoprotein identification. Signals of the rare N-glycoproteins/N-glycopeptides are severely suppressed by the abundant coexisting non-glycosylated counterparts in mass spectrometry analysis. Therefore, specific enrichment of N-glycoprotein/glycopeptide is a prerequisite for large scale N-glycosylation profiling. In this work, we developed a hydrazide functionalized thermosensitive polymer for efficient enrichment and in-depth identification of protein N-glycosylation in human plasma exosome by mass spectrometry. The polymer chains completely dissolve in the enrichment system to form a homogeneous solution. Therefore, efficient covalent coupling between the N-glycoprotein/glycopeptide and the polymer chain is achieved, due to the reduced interfacial mass transfer resistance and the densely packed accessible functional groups on the polymer chains. Furthermore, the thermosensitive polymer can be easily precipitated and recovered by simply rising the system temperature to above 34 °C. As a result, 329 N-glycosylation sites corresponding to 180 N-glycoproteins were enriched and identified from plasma exosomes of glioma patients and healthy subjects using the thermosensitive polymer. By quantitative comparison, we found 26 N-glycoproteins significantly changed between the glioma patients and the healthy subjects, demonstrating the potential of this new strategy for N-glycoproteome research of plasma exosome and biomarker discovery.

Blood	1999	Platelet activation leads to secretion of granule contents and to the formation of microvesicles by shedding of membranes from the cell surface. Recently, we have described small internal vesicles in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and alpha-granules, and suggested that these vesicles are secreted during platelet activation, analogous to the secretion of vesicles termed exosomes by other cell types. In the present study we report that two different types of membrane vesicles are released after stimulation of platelets with thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN (TRAP) or alpha-thrombin: microvesicles of 100 nm to 1 microm, and exosomes measuring 40 to 100 nm in diameter, similar in size as the internal vesicles in MVBs and alpha-granules. Microvesicles could be detected by flow cytometry but not the exosomes, probably because of the small size of the latter. Western blot analysis showed that isolated exosomes were selectively enriched in the tetraspan protein CD63. Whole-mount immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) confirmed this observation. Membrane proteins such as the integrin chains alpha(IIb)-beta(3) and beta(1), GPIbalpha, and P-selectin were predominantly present on the microvesicles. IEM of platelet aggregates showed CD63(+) internal vesicles in fusion profiles of MVBs, and in the extracellular space between platelet extensions. Annexin-V binding was mainly restricted to the microvesicles and to a low extent to exosomes. Binding of factor X and prothrombin was observed to the microvesicles but not to exosomes. These observations and the selective presence of CD63 suggest that released platelet exosomes may have an extracellular function other than the procoagulant activity, attributed to platelet microvesicles.

Regulation of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in Saccharomyces: the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, Mga2p, a transcription activator of the OLE1 gene, regulates the stability of the OLE1 mRNA through exosome-mediated mechanisms.	J Biol Chem	2004	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae OLE1 gene encodes a membrane-bound Delta9 fatty-acid desaturase, whose expression is regulated through transcriptional and mRNA stability controls. In wild type cells grown on fatty acid-free medium, OLE1 mRNA has a half-life of 10 +/- 1.5 min (basal stability) that becomes highly unstable when cells are exposed to unsaturated fatty acids (regulated stability). Activation of OLE1 transcription is dependent on N-terminal fragments of two membrane proteins, Mga2p and Spt23p, that are proteolytically released from the membrane by a ubiquitin-mediated mechanism. Surprisingly, disruption of the MGA2 gene also reduces the half-life of the OLE1 transcript and abolishes fatty acid regulated instability. Disruption of its cognate, SPT23, has no effect on the half-life of the mRNA. Mga2p appears to have two distinct functions with respect to the OLE1 mRNA stability: a stabilizing effect in cells grown in fatty acid-free medium and a destabilizing function in cells that are exposed to unsaturated fatty acids. These functions are independent of OLE1 transcription and can confer basal and regulated stability on OLE1 mRNAs that are produced under the control of the unrelated GAL1 promoter. Expression of soluble, N-terminal fragments of Mga2p stabilize the transcript but do not confer fatty acid-regulated instability on the mRNA suggesting that the stabilizing functions of Mga2p do not require membrane processing and that modifications to the protein introduced during proteolysis may play a role in the destabilizing effect. An analysis of mutants that are defective in mRNA degradation indicate that the Mga2p-requiring control mechanism that regulates the fatty acid-mediated instability of the OLE1 transcript acts by activating exosomal 3' --> 5'-exonuclease degradation activity.

HMGB1 is secreted by immunostimulated enterocytes and contributes to cytomix-induced hyperpermeability of Caco-2 monolayers.	Am J Physiol Cell Physiol	2006	High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a cytokine-like proinflammatory protein, is secreted by activated macrophages and released by necrotic cells. We hypothesized that immunostimulated enterocytes might be another source for this mediator. Accordingly, Caco-2 cells or primary mouse intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were incubated with "cytomix" (a mixture of TNF, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma) for various periods. HMGB1 in cell culture supernatants was detected by Western blot analysis and visualized in Caco-2 cells with the use of fluorescence confocal and immunotransmission electron microscopy. Caco-2 cells growing on filters in diffusion chambers were stimulated with cytomix for 48 h in the absence or presence of anti-HMGB1 antibody, and permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (average molecular mass, 4 kDa; FD4) was assessed. Cytomix-stimulated Caco-2 cells secreted HMGB1 into the apical but not the basolateral compartments of diffusion chambers. Although undetectable at 6 and 12 h after the start of incubation with cytomix, HMGB1 was present in supernatants after 24 h of incubation. HMGB1 secretion by Caco-2 monolayers also was induced when the cells were exposed to FSL-1, a Toll-like receptor (Tlr)-2 agonist, or flagellin, a Tlr5 agonist, but not lipopolysaccharide, a Tlr4 agonist. Cytomix also induced HMGB1 secretion by primary IECs. Cytoplasmic HMGB1 is localized within vesicles in Caco-2 cells and is secreted, at least in part, associated with exosomes. Incubating Caco-2 cells with cytomix increased FD4 permeation, but this effect was significantly decreased in the presence of anti-HMGB1 antibody. Collectively, these data support the view that HMGB1 is secreted by immunostimulated enterocytes. This process may exacerbate inflammation-induced epithelial hyperpermeability via an autocrine feedback loop.

Increased induction of antitumor response by exosomes derived from interleukin-2 gene-modified tumor cells.	J Cancer Res Clin Oncol	2007	PURPOSE: Tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) have been proposed as a new kind of cancer vaccine; however, their in vivo antitumor effects are not satisfactory. In order to further improve the efficacy of vaccination with TEX, we investigated whether interleukin-2 (IL-2) genetic modification of tumor cells can make IL-2 presence in the exosomes, thus increasing antitumor effects of the TEX. METHODS: E.G7-OVA tumor cells expressing Ovalbumin (OVA) as a tumor model antigen were used to prepare TEX by serial centrifugation and sucrose gradients ultracentrifugation. To demonstrate their antitumor effects, IL-2-containing exosomes (Exo/IL-2) were injected subcutaneously into C57BL/C mice: either bearing tumor or followed by tumor inoculation. RESULTS: We found IL-2 within those exosomes as detected by both ELISA and Western blot. Vaccination with these Exo/IL-2 could induce antigen-specific Th1-polarized immune response and Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) more efficiently, resulting in more significant inhibition of tumor growth. CD8(+) T cells are the main effector cells, however, CD4(+) T cells, and NK cells are also involved in the induction of antitumor response of this approach. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that IL-2 genetic modification of tumor cells can make the TEX contain IL-2 with the increased antitumor effects, representing a promising way of exosome-based tumor vaccine.

Generation of novel, secreted epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) isoforms via metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding and exosome secretion.	J Cell Biochem	2008	Exosomes are small membrane vesicles derived from intracellular multivescicular bodies (MVBs) that can undergo constitutive and regulated secretion from cells. Exosomes can also secrete soluble proteins through metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding. In this study, we sought to determine whether ErbB1 receptors are present within exosomes isolated from the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, and whether exosome-associated ErbB1 receptors can undergo further proteolytic processing. We show that full-length transmembrane ErbB1 is secreted in HaCaT exosomes. EGF treatment and calcium flux stimulated the release of phosphorylated ErbB1 in exosomes but only ligand-stimulated release was blocked by the ErbB1 kinase inhibitor, AG1478, indicating that ligand-dependent ErbB1 receptor activation can initiate ErbB1 secretion into exosomes. In addition, other immunoreactive but truncated ErbB1 isoforms were detected in exosomes suggestive of additional proteolytic processing. We demonstrate that cellular and exosomal ErbB1 receptors can undergo ectodomain shedding to generate soluble N-terminal ectodomains and membrane-associated C-terminal remnant fragments (CTFs). ErbB1 shedding was activated by calcium flux and the metalloprotease activator APMA (4-aminophenylmercuric acetate) and was blocked by a metalloprotease inhibitor (GM6001). Soluble ErbB1 ectodomains shed into conditioned medium retained the ability to bind exogenous ligand. Our results provide new insights into the proteolysis, trafficking and fate of ErbB1 receptors and suggest that the novel ErbB1 isoforms may have functions distinct from the plasma membrane receptor.

Discrimination between exosomes and HIV-1: purification of both vesicles from cell-free supernatants.	J Immunol Methods	2008	Although enveloped retroviruses bud from the cell surface of T lymphocytes, they use the endocytic pathway and the internal membrane of multivesicular bodies for their assembly and release from macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Exosomes, physiological nanoparticles produced by hematopoietic cells, egress from this same pathway and are similar to retroviruses in terms of size, density, the molecules they incorporate and their ability to activate immune cells. Retroviruses are therefore likely to contaminate in vitro preparations of exosomes and vice versa and sucrose gradients are inefficient at separating them. However, we have found that their sedimentation velocities in an iodixanol (Optiprep) velocity gradient are sufficiently different to allow separation and purification of both vesicles. Using acetylcholinesterase as an exosome marker, we demonstrate that Optiprep velocity gradients are very efficient in separating exosomes from HIV-1 particles produced on 293T cells, primary CD4(+) T cells, macrophages or DCs, with exosomes collecting at 8.4-12% iodixanol and HIV-1 at 15.6%. We also show that immunodepletion with an anti-acetylcholinesterase antibody rapidly produces highly purified preparations of HIV-1 or exosomes. These findings have applications in fundamental research on exosomes and/or AIDS, as well as in clinical applications where exosomes are involved, more specifically in tumour therapy or in gene therapy using exosomes generated from DCs genetically modified by transfection with virus.

J Virol	2009	CD8(+) T cells display a noncytotoxic activity that suppresses transcription of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in an antigen-independent and major histocompatibility complex-unrestricted manner. To date, the precise cellular and molecular factors mediating this CD8(+) T-cell effector function remain unsolved. Despite evidence indicating the dependence of the activity on cell-cell contact, the possibility of a membrane-mediated activity that represses transcription from the viral promoter remains unexplored. We therefore investigated whether this inhibition of HIV-1 transcription might be elicited by a membrane-bound determinant. Using a CD8(+) T-cell line displaying potent noncytotoxic HIV-1 suppression activity, we have identified a membrane-localized HIV-1-suppressing activity that is concomitantly secreted as 30- to 100-nm endosome-derived tetraspanin-rich vesicles known as exosomes. Purified exosomes from CD8(+) T-cell culture supernatant noncytotoxically suppressed CCR5-tropic (R5) and CXCR4-tropic (X4) replication of HIV-1 in vitro through a protein moiety. Similar antiviral activity was also found in exosomes isolated from two HIV-1-infected subjects. The antiviral exosomes specifically inhibited HIV-1 transcription in both acute and chronic models of infection. Our results, for the first time, indicate the existence of an antiviral membrane-bound factor consistent with the hallmarks defining noncytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell suppression of HIV-1.	PMC2668436

ExoCarta: A compendium of exosomal proteins and RNA.	Proteomics	2009	Exosomes, membrane microvesicles (40-100 nm) secreted by most cell types, can be isolated in several ways while characterizing them is heavily based on electron microscopy and, most importantly, the identification of exosome marker proteins. Researchers rely on the identification of certain exosomal marker proteins including Alix, CD9 and CD63 to confirm the presence of exosomes in their preparations. An evolutionary-conserved set of protein molecules have been identified in most exosomes studied to date. However, with the complexity of tissue/cell type-specific proteins being incorporated in the exosomes, some of these so-called exosomal markers are not always present in all the exosomes. The presence of tissue/cell type-specific proteins in exosomes allows researchers to isolate them using immunoaffinity capture methods. A compendium for exosomal proteomes will aid researchers in identifying proteins that were more commonly found in various exosomes (exosome markers) and those that are specific to certain tissue/cell type-derived exosomes. Here, we describe ExoCarta, a compendium for proteins and RNA molecules identified in exosomes. ExoCarta is first of its kind and the resource is freely available to the scientific community through the web (http://exocarta.ludwig.edu.au). We believe that this community resource will be of great biological importance for any future exosome analyses.

Cell-produced alpha-synuclein is secreted in a calcium-dependent manner by exosomes and impacts neuronal survival.	J Neurosci	2010	alpha-Synuclein is central in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Although initially alpha-synuclein was considered a purely intracellular protein, recent data suggest that it can be detected in the plasma and CSF of humans and in the culture media of neuronal cells. To address a role of secreted alpha-synuclein in neuronal homeostasis, we have generated wild-type alpha-synuclein and beta-galactosidase inducible SH-SY5Y cells. Soluble oligomeric and monomeric species of alpha-synuclein are readily detected in the conditioned media (CM) of these cells at concentrations similar to those observed in human CSF. We have found that, in this model, alpha-synuclein is secreted by externalized vesicles in a calcium-dependent manner. Electron microscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry proteomic analysis demonstrate that these vesicles have the characteristic hallmarks of exosomes, secreted intraluminar vesicles of multivesicular bodies. Application of CM containing secreted alpha-synuclein causes cell death of recipient neuronal cells, which can be reversed after alpha-synuclein immunodepletion from the CM. High- and low-molecular-weight alpha-synuclein species, isolated from this CM, significantly decrease cell viability. Importantly, treatment of the CM with oligomer-interfering compounds before application rescues the recipient neuronal cells from the observed toxicity. Our results show for the first time that cell-produced alpha-synuclein is secreted via an exosomal, calcium-dependent mechanism and suggest that alpha-synuclein secretion serves to amplify and propagate Parkinson's disease-related pathology.

Induction of pregnancy during established EAE halts progression of CNS autoimmune injury via pregnancy-specific serum factors.	J Neuroimmunol	2011	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the CNS involving T cell targeting of myelin antigens.

Using murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we recapitulate pregnancy findings in both relapsing and progressive models. Pregnant mice produced less TNF-α, IL-17 and exhibited reduced CNS pathology relative to non-pregnant controls. Microparticles, called exosomes, shed into the blood during pregnancy were isolated and found to significantly suppress T cell activation relative to those from non-pregnant controls.

GP120-specific exosome-targeted T cell-based vaccine capable of stimulating DC- and CD4(+) T-independent CTL responses.	Vaccine	2011	The limitations of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) have necessitated the development of alternative therapeutics. In this study, we generated ovalbumin (OVA)-pulsed and pcDNAgp120-transfected dendritic cell (DC)-released exosomes (EXOova and EXOgp120) and ConA-stimulated C57BL/6 CD8(+) T cells. OVA- and Gp120-Texo vaccines were generated from CD8(+) T cells with uptake of EXOova and EXOgp120, respectively. We demonstrate that OVA-Texo stimulates in vitro and in vivo OVA-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses leading to long-term immunity against OVA-expressing BL6-10(OVA) melanoma. Interestingly, CD8(+) T cell responses are DC and CD4(+) T cell independent. Importantly, Gp120-Texo also stimulates Gp120-specific CTL responses and long-term immunity against Gp120-expressing B16 melanoma. Therefore, this novel HIV-1-specific EXO-targeted Gp120-Texo vaccine may be useful in induction of efficient CTL responses in AIDS patients with DC dysfunction and CD4(+) T cell deficiency.

A filtration-based protocol to isolate human plasma membrane-derived vesicles and exosomes from blood plasma.	J Immunol Methods	2011	The methods of Plasma Membrane-derived Vesicle (PMV) isolation and quantification vary considerably in the literature and a new standard needs to be defined. This study describes a novel filtration method to isolate PMVs in plasma, which avoids high speed centrifugation, and to quantify them using a Becton Dickinson (BD) FACS Calibur™ flow cytometer, as annexin V-positive vesicles, larger than 0.2 μm in diameter. Essentially microvesicles (which comprise a mixture of PMVs and exosomes) from citrate plasma were sonicated to break up clumped exosomes, and filtered using Millipore 0.1 μm pore size Hydrophilic Durapore membranes in Swinnex 13 mm filter holders. Phosphatidylserine-positive PMVs detected with annexin V-PE were quantified using combined labelling and gating strategies in conjunction with Polysciences Polybead Microspheres (0.2 μm) and BDTrucount tubes. The PMV absolute count was calculated on the analysis template using the Trucount tube lot number information and expressed in PMV count/ml. Having estimated a normal reference range (0.51×10(5)-2.82×10(5) PMVs/ml) from a small sample of human donors, using the developed method, the effect of certain variables was investigated. Variations such as freezing of samples and gender status did not significantly alter the PMV absolute count, and with age plasma PMV levels were only marginally reduced. Smokers appeared to have reduced PMV levels. Nicotine, as for calpeptin was shown to dose-dependently (from 10 up to 50 μM) reduce levels of early apoptosis in THP-1 monocytes and to decrease the level of PMV release. Fasting individuals had 2-3 fold higher PMV absolute counts compared to non-fasting subjects.

Urinary exosomal WT1 in childhood nephrotic syndrome.	Pediatr Nephrol	2012	BACKGROUND: Recently, urinary exosomal WT1 has been proposed as a novel biomarker for simple podocyte injury. We investigated urinary exosomal WT1 to confirm its role as a non-invasive biomarker for predicting steroid responsiveness or renal pathological conditions in patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS). CASE DIAGNOSIS: Forty children with active NS were recruited. Twenty-eight (70%) were steroid-sensitive, including 3 with minimal change NS (MCNS) and 1 with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The remaining 12 (30%) were steroid-resistant, including 8 with FSGS and 4 with MCNS. Urinary exosomes were isolated by a differential centrifugation method, and WT1 was measured by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: WT1 was detected in 25 patients (62.5%). There was no significant difference in the proportion of the patients with a detectable amount of WT1 according to steroid responsiveness or renal pathological condition, the amount of WT1 showed no significant difference according to steroid responsiveness or renal pathological condition, and there was no significant difference in the amount of proteinuria between patients with or without detectable WT1. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary exosomal WT1 was detected in some patients with NS. However, its role as an appropriate biomarker in childhood NS was not verified in this study.

PLoS One	2012	BACKGROUND: Shedding microvesicles are membrane released vesicles derived directly from the plasma membrane. Exosomes are released membrane vesicles of late endosomal origin that share structural and biochemical characteristics with prostasomes. Microvesicles/exosomes can mediate messages between cells and affect various cell-related processes in their target cells. We describe newly detected microvesicles/exosomes from cardiomyocytes and depict some of their biological functions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Microvesicles/exosomes from media of cultured cardiomyocytes derived from adult mouse heart were isolated by differential centrifugation including preparative ultracentrifugation and identified by transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry. They were surrounded by a bilayered membrane and flow cytometry revealed presence of both caveolin-3 and flotillin-1 while clathrin and annexin-2 were not detected. Microvesicle/exosome mRNA was identified and out of 1520 detected mRNA, 423 could be directly connected in a biological network. Furthermore, by a specific technique involving TDT polymerase, 343 different chromosomal DNA sequences were identified in the microvesicles/exosomes. Microvesicle/exosomal DNA transfer was possible into target fibroblasts, where exosomes stained for DNA were seen in the fibroblast cytosol and even in the nuclei. The gene expression was affected in fibroblasts transfected by microvesicles/exosomes and among 333 gene expression changes there were 175 upregulations and 158 downregulations compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study suggests that microvesicles/exosomes released from cardiomyocytes, where we propose that exosomes derived from cardiomyocytes could be denoted "cardiosomes", can be involved in a metabolic course of events in target cells by facilitating an array of metabolism-related processes including gene expression changes.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2012	HLA-DO (DO) is a nonclassic class II heterodimer that inhibits the action of the class II peptide exchange catalyst, HLA-DM (DM), and influences DM localization within late endosomes and exosomes. In addition, DM acts as a chaperone for DO and is required for its egress from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These reciprocal functions are based on direct DO/DM binding, but the topology of DO/DM complexes is not known, in part, because of technical limitations stemming from DO instability. We generated two variants of recombinant soluble DO with increased stability [zippered DOαP11A (szDOv) and chimeric sDO-Fc] and confirmed their conformational integrity and ability to inhibit DM. Notably, we found that our constructs, as well as wild-type sDO, are inhibitory in the full pH range where DM is active (4.7 to ∼6.0). To probe the nature of DO/DM complexes, we used intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and mutagenesis and identified a lateral surface spanning the α1 and α2 domains of szDO as the apparent binding site for sDM. We also analyzed several sDM mutants for binding to szDOv and susceptibility to DO inhibition. Results of these assays identified a region of DM important for interaction with DO. Collectively, our data define a putative binding surface and an overall orientation of the szDOv/sDM complex and have implications for the mechanism of DO inhibition of DM.	PMC3396517

Am J Pathol	2012	Oncosomes are tumor-derived microvesicles that transmit signaling complexes between cell and tissue compartments. Herein, we show that amoeboid tumor cells export large (1- to 10-μm diameter) vesicles, derived from bulky cellular protrusions, that contain metalloproteinases, RNA, caveolin-1, and the GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6, and are biologically active toward tumor cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. We describe methods by which large oncosomes can be selectively sorted by flow cytometry and analyzed independently of vesicles <1 μm. Structures resembling large oncosomes were identified in the circulation of different mouse models of prostate cancer, and their abundance correlated with tumor progression. Similar large vesicles were also identified in human tumor tissues, but they were not detected in the benign compartment. They were more abundant in metastases. Our results suggest that tumor microvesicles substantially larger than exosome-sized particles can be visualized and quantified in tissues and in the circulation, and isolated and characterized using clinically adaptable methods. These findings also suggest a mechanism by which migrating tumor cells condition the tumor microenvironment and distant sites, thereby potentiating advanced disease.	PMC3483805

Cardiac progenitor-derived exosomes protect ischemic myocardium from acute ischemia/reperfusion injury.	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2013	BACKGROUND: Cardiac progenitors (CPC) mediate cardioprotection via paracrine effects. To date, most of studies focused on secreted paracrine proteins. Here we investigated the CPC-derived-exosomes on protecting myocardium from acute ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: CPC were isolated from mouse heart using two-step protocol. Exosomes were purified from conditional medium, and confirmed by electron micrograph and Western blot using CD63 as a marker. qRT-PCR shows that CPC-exosomes have high level expression of GATA4-responsive-miR-451. Exosomes were ex vivo labeled with PKH26, We observed exosomes can be uptaken by H9C2 cardiomyoblasts with high efficiency after 12 h incubation. CPC-exosomes protect H9C2 from oxidative stress by inhibiting caspase 3/7 activation invitro. In vivo delivery of CPC-exosomes in an acute mouse myocardial ischemia/reperfusion model inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis by about 53% in comparison with PBS control (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest, for the first time, the CPC-exosomes can be used as a therapeutic vehicle for cardioprotection, and highlights a new perspective for using non-cell exosomes for cardiac disease.

Shedding of endogenous MHC class I-related chain molecules A and B from different human tumor entities: heterogeneous involvement of the "a disintegrin and metalloproteases" 10 and 17.	Int J Cancer	2013	The interaction of the MHC class I-related chain molecules A and B (MICA and MICB) with the corresponding natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) receptor triggers cytotoxic effector activity of natural killer cells and certain T-cell subsets and provides a costimulatory signal for cytokine production. Thus, the presence of MICA/B on transformed cells contributes to tumor immunosurveillance. Consequently, the proteolytic cleavage of MICA/B is regarded as an important immune escape mechanism of various cancer cells. To investigate the molecular machinery responsible for the shedding of endogenous MICA/B, we analyzed different human tumor entities including mammary, pancreatic and prostate carcinomas. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that all tested tumor cells constitutively expressed MICA and MICB on the cell surface and also released NKG2D ligands into the supernatant. We demonstrate that the "a disintegrin and metalloproteases" (ADAMs) 10 and 17 are largely responsible for the generation of soluble MICA/B. Pharmacological inhibition of metalloproteases reduced the level of released MICA/B and increased cell surface expression. Studies using RNA interference not only revealed a prominent role of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in NKG2D ligand shedding but also a tumor cell-specific role of ADAM10 and/or ADAM17 in shedding of MICA or MICB. Moreover, we report that in the prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3, MICA was not shed at all but rather was secreted in exosomes. These data indicate that the release of NKG2D ligands from individual tumor entities is by far more complex than suggested in previously reported MICA/B transfection systems.

Analysis of microRNA and protein transfer by exosomes during an immune synapse.	Methods Mol Biol	2013	Immune cells release microRNA-containing exosomes that can be taken up by recipient cells. Exosomes can thus act as mediators of cell-cell communication through direct exchange of genetic material between cells. Exosome-mediated transfer of miRNAs between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) can take place over long distances. Our work has shown that this transfer is enhanced by the formation of a functional immune synapse. Here we give a detailed description of the isolation of exosomes produced by immune cells by ultracentrifugation, their quantification by flow cytometry, and the analysis of miRNA and protein exchange between T cells and APCs, both at a distance and after the formation of an immune synapse.

Exosomal pMHC-I complex targets T cell-based vaccine to directly stimulate CTL responses leading to antitumor immunity in transgenic FVBneuN and HLA-A2/HER2 mice and eradicating trastuzumab-resistant tumor in athymic nude mice.	Breast Cancer Res Treat	2013	One of the major obstacles in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific trastuzumab antibody immunotherapy of HER2-positive breast cancer is the development of trastuzumab resistance, warranting the search for other therapeutic strategies. Using mouse models, we previously demonstrated that ovalbumin (OVA)-specific dendritic cell (DC)-released exosome (EXOOVA)-targeted CD4(+) T cell-based (OVA-TEXO) vaccine stimulates efficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses via exosomal peptide/major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)-I, exosomal CD80 and endogenous IL-2 signaling; and long-term CTL memory by means of via endogenous CD40L signaling. In this study, using two-photon microscopy, we provide the first visual evidence on targeting OVA-TEXO to cognate CD8(+) T cells in vivo via exosomal pMHC-I complex. We prepared HER2/neu-specific Neu-TEXO and HER2-TEXO vaccines using adenoviral vector (AdVneu and AdVHER2)-transfected DC (DCneu and DCHER2)-released EXOs (EXOneu and EXOHER2), and assessed their stimulatory effects on HER2/neu-specific CTL responses and antitumor immunity. We demonstrate that Neu-TEXO vaccine is capable of stimulating efficient neu-specific CTL responses, leading to protective immunity against neu-expressing Tg1-1 breast cancer in all 6/6 transgenic (Tg) FVBneuN mice with neu-specific self-immune tolerance. We also demonstrate that HER2-TEXO vaccine is capable of inducing HER2-specific CTL responses and protective immunity against transgene HLA-A2(+)HER2(+) BL6-10A2/HER2 B16 melanoma in 2/8 double Tg HLA-A2/HER2 mice with HER2-specific self-immune tolerance. The remaining 6/8 mice had significantly prolonged survival. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HER2-TEXO vaccine stimulates responses of CD8(+) T cells capable of not only inducing killing activity to HLA-A2(+)HER2(+) BL6-10A2/HER2 melanoma and trastuzumab-resistant BT474A2 breast cancer cells in vitro but also eradicating 6-day palpable HER2(+) BT474A2 breast cancer (3-4 mm in diameter) in athymic nude mice. Therefore, the novel T cell-based HER2-TEXO vaccine may provide a new therapeutic alternative for women with HER2(+) breast cancer, especially for trastuzumab-resistant HER2(+) breast cancer patients.

Exp Dermatol	2013	It has long been known that keratinocytes influence cutaneous immunity through secretion of soluble factors. Exosomes, small membrane vesicles of endocytotic origin, have been implicated in intercellular communication processes such as the transfer of tumor cell antigens and the activation of recipient dendritic cells (DC). However, little is known about immunomodulatory functions of keratinocyte-derived exosomes. To address this question, we analysed exosome secretion of the murine keratinocyte cell line MPEK under steady state as well as inflammatory conditions (+/- IFNγ). These exosomes were readily taken up by bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) in vitro resulting in a matured phenotype, as evidenced by increased CD40 expression as well as by the production of large amounts of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12. When the transfer of antigen-specific information through exosomes was investigated, it was found that keratinocytes took up antigen (ovalbumin) and transferred it to their exosomes. However, these antigen-harbouring exosomes failed to induce antigen-specific T cell responses via BMDC. Together, this novel biological function suggests that keratinocytes are able to direct unspecific immune processes but do not elicit specific immune responses.

Electronic address: .	jack.schalken@radboudumc.nl		Prostate cancer biomarker profiles in urinary sediments and exosomes.	J Urol	2014	PURPOSE: Urinary biomarker tests for diagnosing prostate cancer have gained considerable interest. Urine is a complex mixture that can be subfractionated. We evaluated 2 urinary fractions that contain nucleic acids, ie cell pellets and exosomes. The influence of digital rectal examination before urine collection was also studied and the prostate cancer specific biomarkers PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG were assayed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urine samples were prospectively obtained before and after digital rectal examination from 30 men scheduled for prostate biopsy. Cell pellet and exosomes were isolated and used for biomarker analysis. Analytical and diagnostic performance was tested using the Student t-test and ROC curves. RESULTS: Unlike the exosome fraction, urinary sediment gene expression analysis was compromised by amorphous precipitation in 10% of all specimens. Digital rectal examination resulted in increased mRNA levels in each fraction. This was particularly relevant for the exosomal fraction since after digital rectal examination the number of samples decreased in which cancer specific markers were below the analytical detection limit. Biomarker diagnostic performance was comparable to that in large clinical studies. In exosomes the biomarkers had to be normalized for prostate specific antigen mRNA while cell pellet absolute PCA3 levels had diagnostic value. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes have characteristics that enable them to serve as a stable substrate for biomarker analysis. Thus, digital rectal examination enhances the analytical performance of biomarker analysis in exosomes and cell pellets. The diagnostic performance of biomarkers in exosomes differs from that of cell pellets. Clinical usefulness must be prospectively assessed in larger clinical cohorts.

Exosomal ITGA3 interferes with non-cancerous prostate cell functions and is increased in urine exosomes of metastatic prostate cancer patients.	J Extracell Vesicles	2013	BACKGROUND: Cancer cells are able to change the protein expression and behavior of non-cancerous surrounding cells. Exosomes, secreted by prostate cancer (PCa) cells, may have a functional role in cancer metastasis and present a promising source for protein biomarkers. The aim of the present study was to identify which proteins in exosomes can influence non-cancerous cells, and to determine whether we can use urine exosomal proteins to identify high-risk PCa patients. METHOD: Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Migration and invasion were studied by the transwell (invasion) assay. Proteomics was performed by LC-MS/MS and identified proteins were validated by Western blotting. Cellular uptake of fluorescent labeled PKH67-exosomes was measured by FACS. RESULTS: Based on comparative protein profiling by mass spectrometry-based proteomics of LNCaP- and PC3-exosomes, we selected ITGA3 and ITGB1, involved in migration/invasion, for further analyses. Inhibition of exosomal ITGA3 reduced the migration and invasion of non-cancerous prostate epithelial cells (prEC) almost completely. Cellular uptake of exosomes by prEC was higher with PC3-exosomes compared to LNCaP exosomes. Finally, ITGA3 and ITGB1 were more abundant in urine exosomes of metastatic patients (p<0.05), compared to benign prostate hyperplasia or PCa. CONCLUSION: These data indicate exosomal ITGA3 and ITGB1 may play a role in manipulating non-cancerous surrounding cells and that measurement of ITGA3 and ITGB1 in urine exosomes has the potential to identify patients with metastatic PCa in a non-invasive manner.

Electronic address: .	emil-lou@umn.edu		Tumor exosomes induce tunneling nanotubes in lipid raft-enriched regions of human mesothelioma cells.	Exp Cell Res	2014	Tunneling nanotubes (TnTs) are long, non-adherent, actin-based cellular extensions that act as conduits for transport of cellular cargo between connected cells. The mechanisms of nanotube formation and the effects of the tumor microenvironment and cellular signals on TnT formation are unknown. In the present study, we explored exosomes as potential mediators of TnT formation in mesothelioma and the potential relationship of lipid rafts to TnT formation. Mesothelioma cells co-cultured with exogenous mesothelioma-derived exosomes formed more TnTs than cells cultured without exosomes within 24-48 h; and this effect was most prominent in media conditions (low-serum, hyperglycemic medium) that support TnT formation (1.3-1.9-fold difference). Fluorescence and electron microscopy confirmed the purity of isolated exosomes and revealed that they localized predominantly at the base of and within TnTs, in addition to the extracellular environment. Time-lapse microscopic imaging demonstrated uptake of tumor exosomes by TnTs, which facilitated intercellular transfer of these exosomes between connected cells. Mesothelioma cells connected via TnTs were also significantly enriched for lipid rafts at nearly a 2-fold higher number compared with cells not connected by TnTs. Our findings provide supportive evidence of exosomes as potential chemotactic stimuli for TnT formation, and also lipid raft formation as a potential biomarker for TnT-forming cells.	PMC4159162

Nanomedicine	2014	Exosomes, membranous nanovesicles, naturally carry bio-macromolecules and play pivotal roles in both physiological intercellular crosstalk and disease pathogenesis. Here, we showed that B cell-derived exosomes can function as vehicles to deliver exogenous miRNA-155 mimic or inhibitor into hepatocytes or macrophages, respectively. Stimulation of B cells significantly increased exosome production. Unlike in parental cells, baseline level of miRNA-155 was very low in exosomes derived from stimulated B cells. Exosomes loaded with a miRNA-155 mimic significantly increased miRNA-155 levels in primary mouse hepatocytes and the liver of miRNA-155 knockout mice. Treatment of RAW macrophages with miRNA-155 inhibitor loaded exosomes resulted in statistically significant reduction in LPS-induced TNFα production and partially prevented LPS-induced decrease in SOCS1 mRNA levels. Furthermore, exosome-mediated miRNA-155 inhibitor delivery resulted in functionally more efficient inhibition and less cellular toxicity compared to conventional transfection methods. Similar approaches could be useful in modification of target biomolecules in vitro and in vivo. From the clinical editor: In this study, exosome-based delivery of miRNA-155 mimicker or inhibitor was found to have significant biological response in hepatocytes and macrophages. Exosome-based approaches may be useful in the modification of other target biomolecules.	PMC4180003

Electronic address: .	fangg@ucmail.uc.edu		Cardiomyocytes mediate anti-angiogenesis in type 2 diabetic rats through the exosomal transfer of miR-320 into endothelial cells.	J Mol Cell Cardiol	2014	Exosomes, nano-vesicles naturally released from living cells, have been well recognized to play critical roles in mediating cell-to-cell communication. Given that diabetic hearts exhibit insufficient angiogenesis, it is significant to test whether diabetic cardiomyocyte-derived exosomes possess any capacity in regulating angiogenesis. In this study, we first observed that both proliferation and migration of mouse cardiac endothelial cells (MCECs) were inhibited when co-cultured with cardiomyocytes isolated from adult Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, a commonly used animal model of type 2 diabetes. However, GK-myocyte-mediated anti-angiogenic effects were negated upon addition of GW4869, an inhibitor of exosome formation/release, into the co-cultures. Next, exosomes were purified from the myocyte culture supernatants by differential centrifugation. While exosomes derived from GK myocytes (GK-exosomes) displayed similar size and molecular markers (CD63 and CD81) to those originated from the control Wistar rat myocytes (WT-exosomes), their regulatory role in angiogenesis is opposite. We observed that the MCEC proliferation, migration and tube-like formation were inhibited by GK-exosomes, but were promoted by WT-exosomes. Mechanistically, we found that GK-exosomes encapsulated higher levels of miR-320 and lower levels of miR-126 compared to WT-exosomes. Furthermore, GK-exosomes were effectively taken up by MCECs and delivered miR-320. In addition, transportation of miR-320 from myocytes to MCECs could be blocked by GW4869. Importantly, the exosomal miR-320 functionally down-regulated its target genes (IGF-1, Hsp20 and Ets2) in recipient MCECs, and overexpression of miR-320 inhibited MCEC migration and tube formation. GK exosome-mediated inhibitory effects on angiogenesis were removed by knockdown of miR-320. Together, these data indicate that cardiomyocytes exert an anti-angiogenic function in type 2 diabetic rats through exosomal transfer of miR-320 into endothelial cells. Thus, our study provides a novel mechanism underlying diabetes mellitus-induced myocardial vascular deficiency which may be caused by secretion of anti-angiogenic exosomes from cardiomyocyes.

A comparison of the ability of levels of urinary biomarker proteins and exosomal mRNA to predict outcomes after renal transplantation.	PLoS One	2014	BACKGROUND: mRNA for biomarkers of kidney injury extracted from urinary exosomes may reflect or predict levels of the corresponding protein after transplantation and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Urinary exosomes were isolated from patients following renal transplantation, from healthy controls, and patients with CKD. Expression of exosomal mRNA for the injury biomarkers neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin-18 (IL-18), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and cystatin C was compared with the concentrations of corresponding urinary proteins, 18S RNA and serum creatinine. RESULTS: All biomarker protein concentrations increased after transplantation, and urinary NGAL and IL-18 at 24 and 168 h correlated with the day 7 creatinine reduction ratio (CRR). Exosomal18S RNA increased after transplantation, but exosomal mRNA for NGAL, IL-18 and cystatin C did not correlate with the day 7 CRR, or urinary biomarker concentrations at any time after transplantation. Exosomal NGAL mRNA was lower 4 h after transplantation than in control exosomes. In contrast, exosomal mRNA for cystatin C was unchanged after transplantation and in CKD, although urinary cystatin C temporarily increased following transplantation. Urinary KIM-1 increased after transplantation, but exosomal mRNA for KIM-1 remained undetectable. In CKD 18S RNA was raised, and exosomal mRNA for NGAL, IL-18 and cystatin C was detected in all patients. While urinary NGAL was greater in CKD than control subjects, exosomal NGAL mRNA was unchanged. Exosomal IL-18 mRNA was increased in CKD, but not IL-18 protein. CONCLUSIONS: After renal transplantation, urinary NGAL and IL-18 levels reflect the day 7 CRR. However, while mRNA for these biomarkers is present in exosomes, their levels do not reflect or predict urinary biomarker levels or the CRR. This likely reflects the fact that packaging of mRNA in exosomes is selective, and is not necessarily representative of mRNA in the parent cells responsible for biomarker production.	PMC4053318

Immunity	2014	Foxp3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells prevent inflammatory disease but the mechanistic basis of suppression is not understood completely. Gene silencing by RNA interference can act in a cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manner, providing mechanisms of intercellular regulation. Here, we demonstrate that non-cell-autonomous gene silencing, mediated by miRNA-containing exosomes, is a mechanism employed by Treg cells to suppress T-cell-mediated disease. Treg cells transferred microRNAs (miRNA) to various immune cells, including T helper 1 (Th1) cells, suppressing Th1 cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Use of Dicer-deficient or Rab27a and Rab27b double-deficient Treg cells to disrupt miRNA biogenesis or the exosomal pathway, respectively, established a requirement for miRNAs and exosomes for Treg-cell-mediated suppression. Transcriptional analysis and miRNA inhibitor studies showed that exosome-mediated transfer of Let-7d from Treg cell to Th1 cells contributed to suppression and prevention of systemic disease. These studies reveal a mechanism of Treg-cell-mediated suppression mediated by miRNA-containing exosomes.	PMC4104030

Isolation and characterization of platelet-derived extracellular vesicles.	J Extracell Vesicles	2014	BACKGROUND: Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) participate, for example, in haemostasis, immunity and development. Most studies of platelet EVs have targeted microparticles, whereas exosomes and EV characterization under various conditions have been less analyzed. Studies have been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining EVs free from contaminating cells and platelet remnants. Therefore, we optimized an EV isolation protocol and compared the quantity and protein content of EVs induced by different agonists. METHODS: Platelets isolated with iodixanol gradient were activated by thrombin and collagen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Ca(2+) ionophore. Microparticles and exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugations. EVs were quantitated by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and total protein. Size distributions were determined by NTA and electron microscopy. Proteomics was used to characterize the differentially induced EVs. RESULTS: The main EV populations were 100-250 nm and over 90% were <500 nm irrespective of the activation. However, activation pathways differentially regulated the quantity and the quality of EVs, which also formed constitutively. Thrombogenic activation was the most potent physiological EV-generator. LPS was a weak inducer of EVs, which had a selective protein content from the thrombogenic EVs. Ca(2+) ionophore generated a large population of protein-poor and unselectively packed EVs. By proteomic analysis, EVs were highly heterogeneous after the different activations and between the vesicle subpopulations. CONCLUSIONS: Although platelets constitutively release EVs, vesiculation can be increased, and the activation pathway determines the number and the cargo of the formed EVs. These activation-dependent variations render the use of protein content in sample normalization invalid. Since most platelet EVs are 100-250 nm, only a fraction has been analyzed by previously used methods, for example, flow cytometry. As the EV subpopulations could not be distinguished and large vesicle populations may be lost by differential centrifugation, novel methods are required for the isolation and the differentiation of all EVs.

Identification of microRNAs in exosomes isolated from serum and umbilical cord blood, as well as placentomes of gestational day 90 pregnant sheep.	Mol Reprod Dev	2014	Despite reports that circulating levels of maternal serum exosomes increase during pregnancy and that placenta-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in humans, little is known about exosomes and miRNAs during pregnancy in agriculture animals. In this study, we characterized the expression of 94 miRNAs in ovine placentomes at gestation day (GD) 90 by real-time PCR, and then investigated the presence of these miRNAs in exosome samples isolated from maternal jugular blood in non-pregnant ewes and at GD30 and GD90 and in umbilical blood collected at GD90. In maternal jugular exosome samples, 13 miRNAs were present in lower and 12 miRNAs were present in higher amounts at GD90 compared to non-pregnant (GD0) or GD30. Additionally, 12 miRNAs were present in higher amounts in umbilical venous exosomes compared to umbilical arterial exosomes; only miR-132 was lower in exosomes isolated from umbilical venous blood than from umbilical arterial blood. In placentome samples, miR-34c and miR135a abundance was higher in cotyledon tissue than in caruncle, while miR-183 and miR-379 amounts were higher in caruncle than cotyledon tissue. Only miR-379 was differentially expressed in all serum exosomes and placentome samples. Pathway analysis predicted that differentially expressed maternal serum exosomal miRNAs target Cellular Growth and Proliferation and Organ Development pathways, while umbilical serum exosomal and placentomes miRNAs were predicted to target cellular development and organismal/embryonic development.

Mol Cancer	2014	INTRODUCTION: Exosomes are 30-100 nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin, mediating diverse biological functions including tumor cell invasion, cell-cell communication and antigen presentation through transfer of proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs. Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs can be released through ceramide-dependent secretory machinery regulated by neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) enzyme encoded by the smpd3 gene that triggers exosome secretion. However, whether exosome-mediated microRNA transfer plays any role in cell invasion remains poorly understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the exosomal microRNAs involved in breast cancer invasion. METHODS: The expression level of endogenous and exosomal miRNAs were examined by real time PCR and the expression level of target proteins were detected by western blot. Scanning electron and confocal microscopy were used to characterize exosomes and to study its uptake and transfer. Luciferase reporter plasmids and its mutant were used to confirm direct targeting. Furthermore, the functional significance of exosomal miR-10b was estimated by invasion assay. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that microRNA carrying exosomes can be transferred among different cell lines through direct uptake. miR-10b is highly expressed in metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to non-metastatic breast cancer cells or non-malignant breast cells; it is actively secreted into medium via exosomes. In particular, nSMase2 or ceramide promotes the exosome-mediated miR-10b secretion whereas ceramide inhibitor suppresses this secretion. Moreover, upon uptake, miR-10b can suppress the protein level of its target genes such as HOXD10 and KLF4, indicating its functional significance. Finally, treatment with exosomes derived from MDA-MB-231 cells could induce the invasion ability of non-malignant HMLE cells. CONCLUSION: Together, our results suggest that a set of specific microRNAs may play an important role in modulating tumor microenvironment through exosomes. Thus, a better understanding of this process may aid in the development of novel therapeutic agents.	PMC4258287

Gynecol Oncol	2015	OBJECTIVE: Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynaecological cancer. A major contributor to the poor survival rate is the development of chemoresistance to platinum-based therapies such as cisplatin and carboplatin. Here we aimed to test the role of miRNAs in the acquisition of drug resistance in ovarian cancer. METHODS: We used microarrays to measure miRNA levels in the ovarian cancer cell line A2780 and its cisplatin-resistant derivative CP70. The role of miRNAs and the mRNA targets were tested using transfected miRNA mimics and siRNAs, respectively. Potential in vivo significance was investigated by analysing RNA levels in cohorts of ovarian cancer patients. RESULTS: We identified several miRNAs that are increased in cisplatin-resistant cells. We show that most of these do not directly contribute to cisplatin resistance. Interestingly, miR-21-3p, the passenger strand of the known oncomiR, directed increased resistance to cisplatin in a range of ovarian cell lines. This effect was specific to the star strand, as miR-21-5p had the opposite effect and actually increased sensitivity of A2780 cells to cisplatin. We identify NAV3 as a potential target of miR-21-3p and show that knockdown of NAV3 increases resistance. Exosomes released by CP70 cells were also capable of increasing resistance in A2780 cells, although this was independent of miR-21-3p. Finally, we use publically available transcriptomic data to demonstrate that miR-21-3p is raised, while NAV3 is reduced, in ovarian tumours that are resistant to platinum treatment. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that miR-21-3p can induce cisplatin resistance in ovarian tumours, potentially by targeting the NAV3 gene.

J Virol	2015	Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) package and bring into cells an RNase designated virion host shutoff (VHS) RNase. In infected cells, the VHS RNase targets primarily stress response mRNAs characterized by the presence of AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). In uninfected cells, these RNAs are sequestered in exosomes or P bodies by host proteins that bind to the AU-rich elements. In infected cells, the AU-rich RNAs are deadenylated and cleaved close to the AU-rich elements, leading to long-term persistence of nontranslatable RNAs consisting of the 5' portions of the cleavage products. The host proteins that bind to the AU-rich elements are either resident in cells (e.g., TIA-1) or induced (e.g., tristetraprolin). Earlier, this laboratory reported that tristetraprolin binds VHS RNase. To test the hypothesis that tristetraprolin directs VHS RNase to the AU-rich elements, we mapped the domains of VHS and tristetraprolin required for their interactions. We report that VHS binds to the domain of tristetraprolin that enables its interaction with RNA. A single amino acid substitution in that domain abolished the interaction with RNA but did not block the binding to VHS RNase. In transfected cells, the mutant but not the wild-type tristetraprolin precluded the degradation of the AU-rich RNAs by VHS RNase. We conclude that TTP mediates the cleavage of the 3' UTRs of stress response mRNAs by recruiting the VHS RNase to the AU-rich elements. IMPORTANCE: The primary host response to HSV infection is the synthesis of stress response mRNAs characterized by the presence of AU-rich elements in their 3' UTRs. These mRNAs are the targets of the virion host shutoff (VHS) RNase. The VHS RNase binds both to mRNA cap structure and to tristetraprolin, an inducible host protein that sequesters AU-rich mRNAs in exosomes or P bodies. Here we show that tristetraprolin recruits VHS RNase to the AU-rich elements and enables the degradation of the stress response mRNAs.	PMC4442522

J Neurooncol	2015	Analysis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has emerged as a promising biomarker platform for therapeutic monitoring in glioblastoma patients. However, the contents of the various subpopulations of EVs in these clinical specimens remain poorly defined. Here we characterize the relative abundance of miRNA species in EVs derived from the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of glioblastoma patients. EVs were isolated from glioblastoma cell lines as well as the plasma and CSF of glioblastoma patients. The microvesicle subpopulation was isolated by pelleting at 10,000×g for 30 min after cellular debris was cleared by a 2000×g (20 min) spin. The exosome subpopulation was isolated by pelleting the microvesicle supernatant at 120,000×g (120 min). qRT-PCR was performed to examine the distribution of miR-21, miR-103, miR-24, and miR-125. Global miRNA profiling was performed in select glioblastoma CSF samples. In plasma and cell line derived EVs, the relative abundance of miRNAs in exosome and microvesicles were highly variable. In some specimens, the majority of the miRNA species were found in exosomes while in other, they were found in microvesicles. In contrast, CSF exosomes were enriched for miRNAs relative to CSF microvesicles. In CSF, there is an average of one molecule of miRNA per 150-25,000 EVs. Most EVs derived from clinical biofluids are devoid of miRNA content. The relative distribution of miRNA species in plasma exosomes or microvesicles is unpredictable. In contrast, CSF exosomes are the major EV compartment that harbor miRNAs.	PMC4459648

Electronic address: .	mito@tmig.or.jp		Serum exosomal P-glycoprotein is a potential marker to diagnose docetaxel resistance and select a taxoid for patients with prostate cancer.	Urol Oncol	2015	OBJECTIVES: Docetaxel is used as the first-line chemotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but docetaxel resistance occurs in part owing to induction of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) gene. A recently developed taxane-cabazitaxel-has poor affinity for P-gp and is thereby effective in docetaxel-resistant CRPC. It has been recently demonstrated that exosomes in the body fluids could serve as a diagnostic marker because they contain proteins and RNAs specific to the cells from which they are derived. In this study, we aimed to investigate if P-gp in blood exosomes could be a marker to diagnose docetaxel resistance and select a taxoid for patients with CRPC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation from docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer (PC-3) cells (PC-3R) and their parental PC-3 cells and from the serum of patients. Silencing of P-gp was performed by small interfering RNA transfection. Protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis. Viability of cells treated with docetaxel or cabazitaxel was determined by water soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) assay. RESULTS: The level of P-gp was higher in exosomes as well as cell lysates from PC-3R cells than in those from PC-3 cells. Cabazitaxel effectively killed PC-3R cells, and MDR1 knockdown improved the sensitivity of PC-3R cells to docetaxel but not to cabazitaxel. The P-gp level in blood exosomes was relatively higher in clinically docetaxel-resistant patients than in therapy-naïve patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that detection of P-gp in blood exosomes, which is involved in resistance to docetaxel but not to cabazitaxel, could be useful to diagnose docetaxel resistance and select an appropriate taxoid for patients with CRPC-docetaxel or cabazitaxel.

J Cancer Res Clin Oncol	2016	PURPOSE: Oral cancer (OC) patients are at high risk to develop recurrent disease or secondary primary cancers with no available biomarkers to detect these events until a visible lesion is readily present and diagnosed by biopsy. Exosomes secreted by cancer cells are involved in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. We aimed to determine morphological and molecular differences between oral fluid (OF)-derived exosomes of OC patients and those isolated from healthy individuals (HI). METHODS: OF from OC patients (n = 36) and HI (n = 25) was initially assessed by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Following ultracentrifugation, exosomal pellets of OC patients and HI were morphologically examined by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting (WB) were used to analyze the expression of exosomal markers--CD9, CD81 and CD63. RESULTS: NTA showed that OC samples of OF had a significantly higher concentration of nanoparticles/ml (p = 0.01) and modal nanoparticle size (p = 0.002) compared to HI. The difference in size was structurally highlighted by AFM three-dimensional images applied on exosomal pellets. ELISA and WB showed differential expression of exosomal markers in OC exosomes compared to HI: lower expression of CD81 and CD9 in contrast to a higher expression of CD63 (~53 kDa). CONCLUSIONS: OF-derived exosomes from OC patients differ both morphologically and molecularly from exosomes present in HI. This study is a baseline that provides a starting point for finding exosomal biomarkers for early detection of malignant changes in high-risk patients without overt clinical signs/lesions.

Science	2015	Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) detects cytosolic DNA during virus infection and induces an antiviral state. cGAS signals by synthesis of a second messenger, cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING). We show that cGAMP is incorporated into viral particles, including lentivirus and herpesvirus virions, when these are produced in cGAS-expressing cells. Virions transferred cGAMP to newly infected cells and triggered a STING-dependent antiviral program. These effects were independent of exosomes and viral nucleic acids. Our results reveal a way by which a signal for innate immunity is transferred between cells, potentially accelerating and broadening antiviral responses. Moreover, infection of dendritic cells with cGAMP-loaded lentiviruses enhanced their activation. Loading viral vectors with cGAMP therefore holds promise for vaccine development.	PMC4617605

Exogenous DNA Loading into Extracellular Vesicles via Electroporation is Size-Dependent and Enables Limited Gene Delivery.	Mol Pharm	2015	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold immense promise for utilization as biotherapeutics and drug delivery vehicles due to their nature as biological nanoparticles that facilitate intercellular molecular transport. Specifically, EVs have been identified as natural carriers of nucleic acids, sparking interest in their use for gene therapy and RNA interference applications. So far, small RNAs (siRNA and miRNA) have been successfully loaded into EVs for a variety of delivery applications, but the potential use of EVs for DNA delivery has scarcely been explored. Here, we report that exogenous linear DNA can be associated with EVs via electroporation in quantities sufficient to yield an average of hundreds of DNA molecules per vesicle. We determined that loading efficiency and capacity of DNA in EVs is dependent on DNA size, with linear DNA molecules less than 1000 bp in length being more efficiently associated with EVs compared to larger linear DNAs and plasmid DNAs using this approach. We further showed that EV size is also determinant with regard to DNA loading, as larger microvesicles encapsulated more linear and plasmid DNA than smaller, exosome-like EVs. Additionally, we confirmed the ability of EVs to transfer foreign DNA loaded via electroporation into recipient cells, although functional gene delivery was not observed. These results establish critical parameters that inform the potential use of EVs for gene therapy and, in agreement with other recent results, suggest that substantial barriers must be overcome to establish EVs as broadly applicable DNA delivery vehicles.

Appl Biochem Biotechnol	2016	Milk is a natural nutraceutical produced by mammals. The nanovesicles of milk play a role in horizontal gene transfer and confer health-benefits to milk consumers. These nanovesicles contain miRNA, mRNA, and proteins which mediate the intercellular communication. In this work, we isolated and characterized the buffalo milk-derived nanovesicles by dynamic light scattering (DLS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Western probing, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The DLS data suggested a bimodal size distribution with one mode near 50 nm and the other around 200 nm for the nanovesicles. The NTA and SEM data also supported the size of nanovesicles within a range of 50-200 nm. The FTIR measurements of nanovesicles identified some prominent absorption bands attributable to the proteins (1300-1700 cm(-1), amide A and amide B bands), lipids (2800-3100 cm(-1)), polysaccharides, and nucleic acids (900-1200 cm(-1)). The comparative expression profiles of immune miRNA signatures (miR-15b, miR-21, miR-27b, miR-125b, miR-155, and miR-500) in nanovesicles isolated from milk, serum, and urine revealed that these miRNAs are present abundantly (P < 0.05) in milk-derived nanovesicles. Milk miRNAs (miR-21 and 500) that were also found stable under different household storage conditions indicated that these could be biologically available to milk consumers. Overall, nanovesicles are a new class of bioactive compounds from buffalo milk with high proportion of stable immune miRNAs compared to urine and plasma of same animals.

Isolation of exosomes by differential centrifugation: Theoretical analysis of a commonly used protocol.	Sci Rep	2015	Exosomes, small (40-100 nm) extracellular membranous vesicles, attract enormous research interest because they are carriers of disease markers and a prospective delivery system for therapeutic agents. Differential centrifugation, the prevalent method of exosome isolation, frequently produces dissimilar and improper results because of the faulty practice of using a common centrifugation protocol with different rotors. Moreover, as recommended by suppliers, adjusting the centrifugation duration according to rotor K-factors does not work for "fixed-angle" rotors. For both types of rotors--"swinging bucket" and "fixed-angle"--we express the theoretically expected proportion of pelleted vesicles of a given size and the "cut-off" size of completely sedimented vesicles as dependent on the centrifugation force and duration and the sedimentation path-lengths. The proper centrifugation conditions can be selected using relatively simple theoretical estimates of the "cut-off" sizes of vesicles. Experimental verification on exosomes isolated from HT29 cell culture supernatant confirmed the main theoretical statements. Measured by the nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) technique, the concentration and size distribution of the vesicles after centrifugation agree with those theoretically expected. To simplify this "cut-off"-size-based adjustment of centrifugation protocol for any rotor, we developed a web-calculator.	PMC4663484

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2016	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by cells present an attractive strategy for developing new therapies, but progress in the field is limited by several issues: The quality of the EVs varies with the type and physiological status of the producer cells; protocols used to isolate the EVs are difficult to scale up; and assays for efficacy are difficult to develop. In the present report, we have addressed these issues by using human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) that produce EVs when incubated in a protein-free medium, preselecting the preparations of MSCs with a biomarker for their potency in modulating inflammation, incubating the cells in a chemically defined protein-free medium that provided a stable environment, isolating the EVs with a scalable chromatographic procedure, and developing an in vivo assay for efficacy of the cells in suppressing neuroinflammation after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice. In addition, we demonstrate that i.v. infusion of the isolated EVs shortly after induction of TBI rescued pattern separation and spatial learning impairments 1 mo later.	PMC4711859

A non-invasive miRNA based assay to detect bladder cancer in cell-free urine.	Am J Transl Res	2015	RNA from cell-free urine was analyzed in an attempt to identify a microRNA (miRNA) profile that could be used as a non-invasive diagnostic assay to detect the presence of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) and provide a discriminatory signature for different stages of progression. In addition, the presence of specific miRNAs co-isolating with urinary extracellular vesicles/exosomes was investigated. RNA was isolated from cell-free urine of patients diagnosed with UCB (TaG1, T1G3, ≥T2, CIS) and control patients (healthy control and UCB patients with no evidence of disease). MiRNAs were profiled by qRT-PCR array on pooled samples within each group. Validation of the miRNAs was performed on individual samples using qRT-PCR. Extracellular vesicles were isolated via ultracentrifugation. 236 miRNAs were detected in at least one of the pooled samples. Seven of the miRNAs validated on individual samples had significantly higher levels in the cancer group. A panel of miRNAs discriminated between cancer and cancer-free patients with a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 78%, (AUC=88.8%). We recorded a sensitivity of 80% for TaG1, 95% for T1G3, 90% for ≥T2 with specificity of 77% for healthy controls and 80% for no evidence of disease. Select miRNAs were detected in extracellular vesicles of UCB patients and healthy controls, albeit at different levels. Utilizing this non-invasive assay, we identified miRNA capable of detecting UCB and distinguishing different stages of progression, providing evidence that miRNA profiling in cell-free urine holds promise for the development of valuable clinical diagnostic tools.

Hijacking the Cellular Mail: Exosome Mediated Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells.	Stem Cells Int	2016	Bone transplantation is one of the most widely performed clinical procedures. Consequently, bone regeneration using mesenchymal stem cells and tissue engineering strategies is one of the most widely researched fields in regenerative medicine. Recent scientific consensus indicates that a biomimetic approach is required to achieve proper regeneration of any tissue. Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted by cells that act as messengers that influence cell fate. Although exosomal function has been studied with respect to cancer and immunology, the role of exosomes as inducers of stem cell differentiation has not been explored. We hypothesized that exosomes can be used as biomimetic tools for regenerative medicine. In this study we have explored the use of cell-generated exosomes as tools to induce lineage specific differentiation of stem cells. Our results indicate that proosteogenic exosomes isolated from cell cultures can induce lineage specific differentiation of naïve MSCs in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, exosomes can also bind to matrix proteins such as type I collagen and fibronectin enabling them to be tethered to biomaterials. Overall, the results from this study show the potential of cell derived exosomes in bone regenerative medicine and opens up new avenues for future research.	PMC4736778

Am J Physiol Cell Physiol	2016	Encapsulation of microRNAs in exosomes confers protection against degradation and a vehicle for shuttling of microRNAs between cells and tissues, and cellular uptake by endocytosis. Exosomes can be found in foods including milk. Humans absorb cow's milk exosomes and deliver the microRNA cargo to peripheral tissues, consistent with gene regulation by dietary nucleic acids across species boundaries. Here, we tested the hypothesis that human vascular endothelial cells transport milk exosomes by endocytosis, constituting a step crucial for the delivery of dietary exosomes and their cargo to peripheral tissues. We tested this hypothesis by using human umbilical vein endothelial cells and fluorophore-labeled exosomes isolated from cow's milk. Exosome uptake followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Vmax = 0.057 ± 0.004 ng exosome protein × 40,000 cells/h; Km = 17.97 ± 3.84 μg exosomal protein/200 μl media) and decreased by 80% when the incubation temperature was lowered from 37°C to 4°C. When exosome surface proteins were removed by treatment with proteinase K, or transport was measured in the presence of the carbohydrate competitor d-galactose or measured in the presence of excess unlabeled exosomes, transport rates decreased by 45% to 80% compared with controls. Treatment with an inhibitor of endocytosis, cytochalasin D, caused a 50% decrease in transport. When fluorophore-labeled exosomes were administered retro-orbitally, exosomes accumulated in liver, spleen, and lungs in mice. We conclude that human vascular endothelial cells transport bovine exosomes by endocytosis and propose that this is an important step in the delivery of dietary exosomes and their cargo to peripheral tissues.

Low-density lipoprotein mimics blood plasma-derived exosomes and microvesicles during isolation and detection.	Sci Rep	2016	Circulating extracellular vesicles have emerged as potential new biomarkers in a wide variety of diseases. Despite the increasing interest, their isolation and purification from body fluids remains challenging. Here we studied human pre-prandial and 4 hours postprandial platelet-free blood plasma samples as well as human platelet concentrates. Using flow cytometry, we found that the majority of circulating particles within the size range of extracellular vesicles lacked common vesicular markers. We identified most of these particles as lipoproteins (predominantly low-density lipoprotein, LDL) which mimicked the characteristics of extracellular vesicles and also co-purified with them. Based on biophysical properties of LDL this finding was highly unexpected. Current state-of-the-art extracellular vesicle isolation and purification methods did not result in lipoprotein-free vesicle preparations from blood plasma or from platelet concentrates. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy showed an association of LDL with isolated vesicles upon in vitro mixing. This is the first study to show co-purification and in vitro association of LDL with extracellular vesicles and its interference with vesicle analysis. Our data point to the importance of careful study design and data interpretation in studies using blood-derived extracellular vesicles with special focus on potentially co-purified LDL.	PMC4834552

PO-45 - The role of microvesicles in multiple myeloma progression.	Thromb Res	2016	INTRODUCTION: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable, genetically heterogeneous malignancy of plasma cells that secrete non-functioning immunoglobulins and present high proteasome activity. MM is characterized by bone marrow infiltration leading to multiple lytic bone lesions, cytopenia and increased rate of thrombotic events. Microvesicles (MVs) include exosomes (30-100 nm) and microparticles (0.1-1 micron) shed from various cells and expressing antigens reflecting their cellular origin. MVs are involved in thrombosis, inflammation and cancer.However, the effect of MM-MVs on disease progression and their mechanism of action are unclear. We assume that MVs play a role in the interaction between malignant plasma cells and mesenchymal and endothelial cells (EC). AIM: To characterize MM-MVs and investigate their effects on microenvironment cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MVs were isolated from MM cell line RPMI 8226 untreated or treated with bortezomib and from peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of MM patients (n=13) and healthy controls (n=14). MM-MV size, concentration and cell origin were measured by Nanosite and FACS. Protein content was evaluated by protein arrays and ELISA. Coagulation and proteasome activity were assessed using chromogenic assays. Migratory capacity (migration assay), proliferative rate (XTT assay) and cell-signaling effects (Western blot analysis) of MVs on BM-mesenchymal and ECs were analyzed. RESULTS: MM cells exhibited high MV shedding rate, which further increased with the exposure to bortezomib. Significant elevation in MV production was found in MM patients compared to controls. MM-MVs expressed membrane MM markers (syndecan-1/ CD138, CD38), coagulation factor (TF, TFPI, EPCR, TM) and angiogenic factors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and CD31). MM-MVs contained high levels of growth factors (Angiogenin, PDGF-BB and VEGF) and displayed procoagulant and proteasome activity. MM-MVs penetrated cells and affected their function. MVs of untreated cells and patient MVs increased EC and mesenchymal cell migration and EC proliferation, while MVs obtained from bortezomib-treated cells decreased these effects. MVs of untreated cells increased ERK1/2 and c-Jun phosphorylation in ECs (by 6.15 and 1.84 fold) but did not affect MAPKAPK-2. MVs of bortezomib-treated cells reduced c-Jun phosphorylation in ECs. CONCLUSIONS: MM cells are characterized by high shedding rate of MVs. They are pro-coagulants and increase EC thrombogenicity, suggesting their involvement in MM-related thrombosis. MVs contain high levels of angiogenic factors that affect mesenchymal and EC, induce cell migration and proliferation via specific signal transductions. MVs exposed to bortezomib display lower levels of angiogenic factors, which limits proliferation and migration of MVs, reflecting the efficacy of therapy and MM dynamics.

Analyst	2016	Exosomes are secreted nanovesicles shed by almost all kinds of cells. Recently, increased interest has been focused on these extracellular vesicles as natural carriers transporting biological contents for intercellular communication. However, current isolation techniques, such as ultracentrifugation, are not convenient and often require specialized equipment. Herein, we describe a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based approach, which could permit facile, low-cost and effective isolation of exosomes from cell culture supernatant. High-resolution electron microscopes clearly visualized the size and morphology of isolated exosome aggregates, implying the mechanism of PEG-based precipitation. Combined with tandem mass spectrometry analysis, 6299 protein groups encoded by 5120 genes were successfully characterized from HeLa cell culture supernatant, including numerous exosome proteins which could overlap 97% of the Top 100 exosome marker proteins recorded in the ExoCarta database, as well as a series of low-abundance cytokines and biomarkers. Furthermore, we found a higher ratio of neo-cleavage sites in proteins identified from exosomes compared with cellular proteins, revealing the potential roles of exosomes in accumulation and transportation of protein degradation intermediates.

Amnion-Epithelial-Cell-Derived Exosomes Demonstrate Physiologic State of Cell under Oxidative Stress.	PLoS One	2016	At term, the signals of fetal maturity and feto-placental tissue aging prompt uterine readiness for delivery by transitioning quiescent myometrium to an active stage. It is still unclear how the signals reach the distant myometrium. Exosomes are a specific type of extracellular vesicle (EVs) that transport molecular signals between cells, and are released from a wide range of cells, including the maternal and fetal cells. In this study, we hypothesize that i) exosomes act as carriers of signals in utero-placental compartments and ii) exosomes reflect the physiologic status of the origin cells. The primary aims of this study were to determine exosomal contents in exosomes derived from primary amnion epithelial cells (AEC). We also determined the effect of oxidative stress on AEC derived exosomal cargo contents. AEC were isolated from amniotic membrane obtained from normal, term, not in labor placentae at delivery, and culture under standard conditions. Oxidative stress was induced using cigarette smoke extract for 48 hours. AEC-conditioned media were collected and exosomes isolated by differential centrifugations. Both growth conditions (normal and oxidative stress induced) produced cup shaped exosomes of around 50 nm, expressed exosomes enriched markers, such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and HSC70, embryonic stem cell marker Nanog, and contained similar amounts of cell free AEC DNA. Using confocal microscopy, the colocalization of histone (H) 3, heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and activated form of pro-senescence and term parturition associated marker p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) (P-p38 MAPK) co-localized with exosome enrich marker CD9. HSP70 and P-p38 MAPK were significantly higher in exosomes from AEC grown under oxidative stress conditions than standard conditions (p<0.05). Finally, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis identified 221 different proteins involved in immunomodulatory response and cell-to-cell communication. This study determined AEC exosome characteristics and their cargo reflected the physiologic status of the cell of origin and suggests that AEC-derived exosomal p38 MAPK plays a major role in determining the fate of pregnancy. Understanding the propagation of fetal signals and their mechanisms in normal term pregnancies can provide insights into pathologic activation of such signals associated with spontaneous preterm parturitions.

Barriers to horizontal cell transformation by extracellular vesicles containing oncogenic H-ras.	Oncotarget	2016	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) enable the exit of regulatory, mutant and oncogenic macromolecules (proteins, RNA and DNA) from their parental tumor cells and uptake of this material by unrelated cellular populations. Among the resulting biological effects of interest is the notion that cancer-derived EVs may mediate horizontal transformation of normal cells through transfer of mutant genes, including mutant ras. Here, we report that H-ras-mediated transformation of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-18) results in the emission of exosome-like EVs containing genomic DNA, HRAS oncoprotein and transcript. However, EV-mediated horizontal transformation of non-transformed cells (epithelial, astrocytic, fibroblastic and endothelial) is transient, limited or absent due to barrier mechanisms that curtail the uptake, retention and function of oncogenic H-ras in recipient cells. Thus, epithelial cells and astrocytes are resistant to EV uptake, unless they undergo malignant transformation. In contrast, primary and immortalized fibroblasts are susceptible to the EV uptake, retention of H-ras DNA and phenotypic transformation, but these effects are transient and fail to produce a permanent tumorigenic conversion of these cells in vitro and in vivo, even after several months of observation. Increased exposure to EVs isolated from H-ras-transformed cancer cells, but not to those from their indolent counterparts, triggers demise of recipient fibroblasts. Uptake of H-ras-containing EVs stimulates but fails to transform primary endothelial cells. Thus, we suggest that intercellular transfer of oncogenes exerts regulatory rather than transforming influence on recipient cells, while cancer cells may often act as preferential EV recipients.

Modification of tumor cell exosome content by transfection with wt-p53 and microRNA-125b expressing plasmid DNA and its effect on macrophage polarization.	Oncogenesis	2016	Exosomes are responsible for intercellular communication between tumor cells and others in the tumor microenvironment. These microvesicles promote oncogensis and can support towards metastasis by promoting a pro-tumorogenic environment. Modifying the exosomal content and exosome delivery are emerging novel cancer therapies. However, the clinical translation is limited due to feasibility of isolating and delivery of treated exosomes as well as an associated immune response in patients. In this study, we provide proof-of-concept for a novel treatment approach for manipulating exosomal content by genetic transfection of tumor cells using dual-targeted hyaluronic acid-based nanoparticles. Following transfection with plasmid DNA encoding for wild-type p53 (wt-p53) and microRNA-125b (miR-125b), we evaluate the transgene expression in the SK-LU-1 cells and in the secreted exosomes. Furthermore, along with modulation of wt-p53 and miR-125b expression, we also show that the exosomes (i.e., wt-p53/exo, miR-125b/exo and combination/exo) have a reprogramed global miRNA profile. The miRNAs in the exosomes were mainly related to the activation of genes associated with apoptosis as well as p53 signaling. More importantly, these altered miRNA levels in the exosomes could mediate macrophage repolarization towards a more pro-inflammatory/antitumor M1 phenotype. However, further studies, especially in vivo studies, are warranted to assess the direct influence of such macrophage reprogramming on cancer cells and oncogenesis post-treatment. The current study provides a novel platform enabling the development of therapeutic strategies affecting not only the cancer cells but also the tumor microenvironment by utilizing the 'bystander effect' through genetic transfer with secreted exosomes. Such modification could also support antitumor environment leading to decreased oncogenesis.	PMC5007827

Cytotherapy	2016	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of exosomes produced by human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hiPSC-MSCs-Exo) on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated and concentrated from conditioned medium using ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration. hiPSC-MSCs-Exo were injected systemically via the inferior vena cava in a rat model of 70% warm hepatic I/R injury, and the therapeutic effect was evaluated. The serum levels of transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) were measured using an automatic analyzer. The expression of inflammatory factors was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Histological changes indicated changes in pathology and inflammatory infiltration in liver tissue. Apoptosis of hepatic cells in liver tissue was measured using terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining along with apoptotic markers. RESULTS: hiPSCs were efficiently induced into hiPSC-MSCs with typical MSC characteristics. hiPSC-MSCs-Exo had diameters ranging from 50 to 60 nm and expressed exosomal markers (CD9, CD63 and CD81). Hepatocyte necrosis and sinusoidal congestion were markedly suppressed with a lower Suzuki score after hiPSC-MSCs-Exo administration. The levels of the hepatocyte injury markers AST and ALT were significantly lower in the treated group than in the control group. Inflammatory markers, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), were significantly reduced after administration of hiPSC-MSCs-Exo, which suggests that the exosomes have a role in suppressing the inflammatory response. Additionally, in liver tissues from the experimental group, the levels of apoptotic markers, such as caspase-3 and bax, were significantly lower and the levels of oxidative markers, such as glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were significantly higher than in the control group. These data point to an anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative stress response role for hiPSC-MSCs-Exo. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that hiPSC-MSCs-Exo alleviate hepatic I/R injury, possibly via suppression of inflammatory responses, attenuation of the oxidative stress response and inhibition of apoptosis.

Cancer-associated fibroblast exosomes regulate survival and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells.	Oncogene	2017	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise the majority of the tumor bulk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Current efforts to eradicate these tumors focus predominantly on targeting the proliferation of rapidly growing cancer epithelial cells. We know that this is largely ineffective with resistance arising in most tumors following exposure to chemotherapy. Despite the long-standing recognition of the prominence of CAFs in PDAC, the effect of chemotherapy on CAFs and how they may contribute to drug resistance in neighboring cancer cells is not well characterized. Here, we show that CAFs exposed to chemotherapy have an active role in regulating the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. We found that CAFs are intrinsically resistant to gemcitabine, the chemotherapeutic standard of care for PDAC. Further, CAFs exposed to gemcitabine significantly increase the release of extracellular vesicles called exosomes. These exosomes increased chemoresistance-inducing factor, Snail, in recipient epithelial cells and promote proliferation and drug resistance. Finally, treatment of gemcitabine-exposed CAFs with an inhibitor of exosome release, GW4869, significantly reduces survival in co-cultured epithelial cells, signifying an important role of CAF exosomes in chemotherapeutic drug resistance. Collectively, these findings show the potential for exosome inhibitors as treatment options alongside chemotherapy for overcoming PDAC chemoresistance.	PMC5366272

Exosomes, not protein or lipids, in mesenteric lymph activate inflammation: Unlocking the mystery of post-shock multiple organ failure.	J Trauma Acute Care Surg	2017	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that mesenteric lymph (ML) has a crucial role in driving the systemic inflammatory response after trauma/hemorrhagic shock (T/HS). The specific mediators in the ML that contribute to its biological activity remain unclear despite decades of study. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that are shed into body fluids such as serum and urine that can mediate intercellular communication. We hypothesized that exosomes are present in the ML after trauma/shock and are responsible for the biological activity of ML. METHODS: Male rats underwent cannulation of the vessels and mesenteric lymph duct. T/HS was induced by laparotomy and 60 minutes of HS (mean arterial pressure, 35 mmHg), followed by resuscitation. The ML was collected during three distinct time periods (pre-shock, shock, and resuscitation phase) and subsequently separated into exosome and supernatant fractions. Exosomes were characterized by electron microscope, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and immunoblotting. The biological activity of exosomes and supernatant of ML were characterized using a monocyte NF-κB reporter assay and by measuring macrophage intracellular TNF-α production. RESULTS: Exosomes were identified in ML by size and expression of the exosome markers CD63 and HSP70. The number of exosomes present in the ML was 2-fold increased during shock and 4-fold decreased in resuscitation phase compared to pre-shock. However, biological activity of exosomes isolated during the resuscitation phase was markedly increased and caused an 8-fold increase in monocyte NF-κB activation compared to supernatant. Macrophage TNF-α production was also increased after exposure to exosomes harvested in the resuscitation phase. The ML supernatant fraction had no effect on TNF-α production during any phase. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that exosomes, and not the liquid fraction of ML, are the major component triggering inflammatory responses in monocytes and macrophages after experimental T/HS.

Methods Mol Biol	2017	Epstein-Barr virus is an oncogenic herpesvirus associated with several human malignancies. Although the details of the molecular steps involved in EBV-mediated cell transformation and immune evasion are not fully known, a number of viral products, including EBV latent proteins and non-protein coding RNAs have been shown to be involved, directly or indirectly in these processes. In recent years, a growing body of data indicates that some viruses are able to transport selected products to neighboring cells and induce biological changes by exploiting the exosome secretory pathway. Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted by virtually all cell types and present in most body fluids. Here, we describe the protocols used in our laboratory to isolate and characterize exosomes from EBV-infected, noninfected, and transfected cell lines.

Methods Mol Biol	2017	RNA interference (RNAi) has tremendous potential for specific silencing of disease-causing genes. Its clinical usage however critically depends on the development of carrier systems that can transport the RNAi-mediating small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules to the cytosol of target cells. Recent reports have suggested that extracellular vesicles (EVs) form a natural transport system through which biomolecules, including RNA, is exchanged between cells. Therefore, EVs are increasingly being considered as potential therapeutic siRNA delivery systems.In this chapter we describe a method for preparing siRNA-loaded EVs, including a robust, scalable method to isolate them from cell culture supernatants.

A Novel Sensitive Method to Measure Catechol-O-Methyltransferase Activity Unravels the Presence of This Activity in Extracellular Vesicles Released by Rat Hepatocytes.	Front Pharmacol	2016	There is a clear need for drug treatments to be selected according to the characteristics of an individual patient, in order to improve efficacy and reduce the number and severity of adverse drug reactions. One of the main enzymes to take into account in pharmacogenomics is catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), which catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to catechols and catecholamines, like the neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Although, most of this enzyme is associated to intracellular vesicles, recently it has also been detected in extracellular vesicles secreted by hepatocytes and in serum circulating vesicles. COMT has implications in many neurological and psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, chronic fatigue, pain response, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorders. Remarkably, genetic variations of COMT affect its activity and are associated to various human disorders from psychiatric diseases to estrogen-induced cancers. Consequently, the establishment of new methods to evaluate COMT activity is an important aspect to investigate the biology of this drug-metabolizing enzyme. Herein, we have developed a sensitive and selective method to determine COMT activity. We first optimized the activity in rat liver incubated with two different substrates; norepinephrine and dopamine. The enzymatically formed products (normetanephrine and 3-methoxytyramine, respectively) were extracted by solid-phase extraction using weak cation exchange cartridges, chromatographically separated, and detected and quantified using a mass spectrometer. The range of quantitation for both products was from 0.005 to 25 μg/mL. This methodology offers acceptable recovery for both enzymatic products (≥75%) and good accuracy and precision (≤15%). The lower limit of quantifications were 0.01 and 0.005 μM for 3-methoxytyramine and normetanephrine, respectively. Importantly, this sensitive assay was able to detect the presence of COMT activity in extracellular vesicles secreted by hepatocytes supporting a potential role of these vesicles in catecholamines and catecholestrogens metabolisms. In addition, the presence of COMT activity in extracellular vesicles opens new possibilities to develop tools to evaluate personalized drug response in a low invasive manner.	PMC5179529

Detection of phosphatidylserine-positive exosomes as a diagnostic marker for ovarian malignancies: a proof of concept study.	Oncotarget	2017	There are no suitable screening modalities for ovarian carcinomas (OC) and repeated imaging and CA-125 levels are often needed to triage equivocal ovarian masses. Definitive diagnosis of malignancy, however, can only be established by histologic confirmation. Thus, the ability to detect OC at early stages is low, and most cases are diagnosed as advanced disease. Since tumor cells expose phosphatidylserine (PS) on their plasma membrane, we predicted that tumors might secrete PS-positive exosomes into the bloodstream that could be a surrogate biomarker for cancer. To address this, we developed a highly stringent ELISA that detects picogram quantities of PS in patient plasma. Blinded plasma from 34 suspect ovarian cancer patients and 10 healthy subjects were analyzed for the presence of PS-expressing vesicles. The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test showed the malignant group had significantly higher PS values than the benign group (median 0.237 vs. -0.027, p=0.0001) and the malignant and benign groups had significantly higher PS values than the healthy group (median 0.237 vs -0.158, p<0.0001 and -0.027 vs -0.158, p=0.0002, respectively). ROC analysis of the predictive accuracy of PS-expressing exosomes/vesicles in predicting malignant against normal, benign against normal and malignant against benign revealed AUCs of 1.0, 0.95 and 0.911, respectively. This study provides proof-of-concept data that supports the high diagnostic power of PS detection in the blood of women with suspect ovarian malignancies.	PMC5362413

C-Met/miR-130b axis as novel mechanism and biomarker for castration resistance state acquisition.	Oncogene	2017	Although a significant subset of prostate tumors remain indolent during the entire life, the advanced forms are still one of the leading cause of cancer-related death. There are not reliable markers distinguishing indolent from aggressive forms. Here we highlighted a new molecular circuitry involving microRNA and coding genes promoting cancer progression and castration resistance. Our preclinical and clinical data demonstrated that c-Met activation increases miR-130b levels, inhibits androgen receptor expression, promotes cancer spreading and resistance to hormone ablation therapy. The relevance of these findings was confirmed on patients' samples and by in silico analysis on an independent patient cohort from Taylor's platform. Data suggest c-Met/miR-130b axis as a new prognostic marker for patients' risk assessment and as an indicator of therapy resistance. Our results propose new biomarkers for therapy decision-making in all phases of the pathology. Data may help identify high-risk patients to be treated with adjuvant therapy together with alternative cure for castration-resistant forms while facilitating the identification of possible patients candidates for anti-Met therapy. In addition, we demonstrated that it is possible to evaluate Met/miR-130b axis expression in exosomes isolated from peripheral blood of surgery candidates and advanced patients offering a new non-invasive tool for active surveillance and therapy monitoring.

Mol Neurobiol	2018	A number of neuronal and glial proteins were previously found to be released in free-standing soluble form from cultured brain cells into cell-conditioned media. Here, we sought to examine if similar proteins are also contained in neural and astroglial cell-released extracellular microvesicles/exosomes (MV/E). In this study, MV/E were isolated from cell-conditioned media from control and cytotoxin-challenged rat cerebrocortical mixed culture (CTX) and mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells. Cytotoxin challenges included pro-necrosis calcium ionophore A23187, pro-apoptosis staurosporine (STS), and excitotoxin N-methyl-D-aspartate. Based on established nanoparticle characterization method (dynamic light scattering, NanoTracker, and transmission electron microscopy), we confirmed that these released vesicles are in fact characteristic representation of MV/E by morphology (lipid bilayered vesicles) and by particle size (132-142 nm for CTX and 49-77 nm for N2a cells). We indeed identified neural cell body protein UCH-L1, axonal injury marker αII-spectrin and its breakdown products (SBDPs), astroglial markers GFAP and its breakdown products (GFAP-BDP), dendritic protein BIII-tubulin, synaptic protein synaptophysin, and exosome marker Alix in microvesicles from CTX and/or N2a cells. Furthermore, SBDPs, GFAP-BDP, UCH-L1, and synaptophysin are especially dominant in MV/E isolated from cytotoxin-treated CTX cells. Similarly, SBDPs, βIII-tubulin, and UCH-L1 are more prominently observed in cytotoxin-challenged N2a cells. Lastly, when isolated MV/E from A23187- or STS-challenged N2a cells were introduced to healthy N2a culture, they are capable of evoking cytotoxicity in the latter. Taken together, our study identified that microvesicles/exosomes isolated form healthy and injured brain cells contain certain neural and astroglial proteins, as well as possibly other cytotoxic factors that are capable of propagating cytotoxic effects.

Am J Physiol Renal Physiol	2017	Kidney repair following injury involves the reconstitution of a structurally and functionally intact tubular epithelium. Growth factors and their receptors, such as EGFR, are important in the repair of renal tubules. Exosomes are cell-produced small (~100 nm in diameter) vesicles that contain and transfer proteins, lipids, RNAs, and DNAs between cells. In this study, we examined the relationship between exosome production and EGFR activation and the potential role of exosome in wound healing. EGFR activation occurred shortly after scratch wounding in renal tubular cells. Wound repair after scratching was significantly promoted by EGF and suppressed by EGFR inhibitor gefitinib. Interestingly, scratch wounding induced a significant increase of exosome production. The exosome production was decreased by EGF and increased by gefitinib, suggesting a suppressive role of EGFR signaling in exosome production. Conversely, inhibition of exosome release by GW4869 and manumycin A markedly increased EGFR activation and promoted wound healing. Moreover, exosomes derived from scratch-wounding cells could inhibit wound healing. Collectively, the results indicate that wound healing in renal tubular cells is associated with EGFR activation and exosome production. Although EGFR activation promotes wound healing, released exosomes may antagonize EGFR activation and wound healing.	PMC5495889

Mol Ther	2017	The vascular response to pro-atherosclerotic factors is a multifactorial process involving endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages (MACs), and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), although the mechanism by which these cell types communicate with each other in response to environmental cues is yet to be understood. Here, we show that miR-155, which is significantly expressed and secreted in Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5)-overexpressing vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), is a potent regulator of endothelium barrier function through regulating endothelial targeting tight junction protein expression. VSMCs-derived exosomes mediate the transfer of KLF5-induced miR-155 from SMCs to ECs, which, in turn, destroys tight junctions and the integrity of endothelial barriers, leading to an increased endothelial permeability and enhanced atherosclerotic progression. Moreover, overexpression of miR-155 in ECs inhibits endothelial cell proliferation/migration and re-endothelialization in vitro and in vivo and thus increases vascular endothelial permeability. Blockage of the exosome-mediated transfer of miR-155 between these two cells may serve as a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.	PMC5475247

Characterisation of adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicle subtypes identifies distinct protein and lipid signatures for large and small extracellular vesicles.	J Extracell Vesicles	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are biological vectors that can modulate the metabolism of target cells by conveying signalling proteins and genomic material. The level of EVs in plasma is significantly increased in cardiometabolic diseases associated with obesity, suggesting their possible participation in the development of metabolic dysfunction. With regard to the poor definition of adipocyte-derived EVs, the purpose of this study was to characterise both qualitatively and quantitatively EVs subpopulations secreted by fat cells. Adipocyte-derived EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation of conditioned media collected from 3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured for 24 h in serum-free conditions. Based on morphological and biochemical properties, as well as quantification of secreted EVs, we distinguished two subpopulations of adipocyte-derived EVs, namely small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and large extracellular vesicles (lEVs). Proteomic analyses revealed that lEVs and sEVs exhibit specific protein signatures, allowing us not only to define novel markers of each population, but also to predict their biological functions. Despite similar phospholipid patterns, the comparative lipidomic analysis performed on these EV subclasses revealed a specific cholesterol enrichment of the sEV population, whereas lEVs were characterised by high amounts of externalised phosphatidylserine. Enhanced secretion of lEVs and sEVs is achievable following exposure to different biological stimuli related to the chronic low-grade inflammation state associated with obesity. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of primary murine adipocytes to secrete sEVs and lEVs, which display physical and biological characteristics similar to those described for 3T3-L1. Our study provides additional information and elements to define EV subtypes based on the characterisation of adipocyte-derived EV populations. It also underscores the need to distinguish EV subpopulations, through a combination of multiple approaches and markers, since their specific composition may cause distinct metabolic responses in recipient cells and tissues.

Serum extracellular vesicles contain protein biomarkers for primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma.	Hepatology	2017	Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) includes a heterogeneous group of biliary cancers with poor prognosis. Several conditions, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), are risk factors. Noninvasive differential diagnosis between intrahepatic CCA and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is sometimes difficult. Accurate noninvasive biomarkers for PSC, CCA, and HCC are not available. In the search for novel biomarkers, serum extracellular vesicles (EV) were isolated from CCA (n = 43), PSC (n = 30), or HCC (n = 29) patients and healthy individuals (control, n = 32); and their protein content was characterized. By using nanoparticle tracking analysis, serum EV concentration was found to be higher in HCC than in all the other groups. Round morphology (by transmission electron microscopy), size (∼180 nm diameter by nanoparticle tracking analysis), and markers (clusters of differentiation 9, 63, and 81 by immunoblot) indicated that most serum EV were exosomes. Proteome profiles (by mass spectrometry) revealed multiple differentially expressed proteins among groups. Several of these proteins showed high diagnostic values with maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.878 for CCA versus control, 0.905 for CCA stage I-II versus control, 0.789 for PSC versus control, 0.806 for noncirhottic PSC versus control, 0.796 for CCA versus PSC, 0.956 for CCA stage I-II versus PSC, 0.904 for HCC versus control, and 0.894 for intrahepatic CCA versus HCC. Proteomic analysis of EV derived from CCA human cells in vitro revealed higher abundance of oncogenic proteins compared to EV released by normal human cholangiocytes. Orthotopic implant of CCA human cells in the liver of immunodeficient mice resulted in the release to serum of EV containing some similar human oncogenic proteins. CONCLUSION: Proteomic signatures found in serum EV of CCA, PSC, and HCC patients show potential usefulness as diagnostic tools. (Hepatology 2017;66:1125-1143).

Sci Rep	2017	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a dominant cause of chronic liver disease, but the exact mechanism of progression from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of exosomes in NAFLD progression. Exosomes were isolated from a human hepatoma cell line treated with palmitic acid (PA) and their miRNA profiles examined by microarray. The human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line (LX-2) was then treated with exosome isolated from hepatocytes. Compared with controls, PA-treated hepatocytes displayed significantly increased CD36 and exosome production. The microarray analysis showed there to be distinctive miRNA expression patterns between exosomes from vehicle- and PA-treated hepatocytes. When LX-2 cells were cultured with exosomes from PA-treated hepatocytes, the expression of genes related to the development of fibrosis were significantly amplified compared to those treated with exosomes from vehicle-treated hepatocytes. In conclusion, PA treatment enhanced the production of exosomes in these hepatocytes and changed their exosomal miRNA profile. Moreover, exosomes derived from PA-treated hepatocytes caused an increase in the expression levels of fibrotic genes in HSCs. Therefore, exosomes may have important roles in the crosstalk between hepatocytes and HSCs in the progression from simple steatosis to NASH.	PMC5473841

Proteomics Profiling of Exosomes from Primary Mouse Osteoblasts under Proliferation versus Mineralization Conditions and Characterization of Their Uptake into Prostate Cancer Cells.	J Proteome Res	2017	Osteoblasts communicate both with normal cells in the bone marrow and with tumor cells that metastasized to bone. Here we show that osteoblasts release exosomes, we termed osteosomes, which may be a novel mechanism by which osteoblasts communicate with cells in their environment. We have isolated exosomes from undifferentiated/proliferating (D0 osteosomes) and differentiated/mineralizing (D24 osteosomes) primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts. The D0 and D24 osteosomes were found to be vesicles of 130-140 nm by dynamic light scattering analysis. Proteomics profiling using tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identified 206 proteins in D0 osteosomes and 336 in D24 osteosomes. The proteins in osteosomes are mainly derived from the cytoplasm (∼47%) and plasma membrane (∼31%). About 69% of proteins in osteosomes are also found in Vesiclepedia, and these canonical exosomal proteins include tetraspanins and Rab family proteins. We found that there are differences in both protein content and levels in exosomes isolated from undifferentiated and differentiated osteoblasts. Among the proteins that are unique to osteosomes, 169 proteins are present in both D0 and D24 osteosomes, 37 are unique to D0, and 167 are unique to D24. Among those 169 proteins present in both D0 and D24 osteosomes, 10 proteins are likely present at higher levels in D24 than D0 osteosomes based on emPAI ratios of >5. These results suggest that osteosomes released from different cellular state of osteoblasts may mediate distinct functions. Using live-cell imaging, we measured the uptake of PKH26-labeled osteosomes into C4-2B4 and PC3-mm2 prostate cancer cells. In addition, we showed that cadherin-11, a cell adhesion molecule, plays a role in the uptake of osteosomes into PC3-mm2 cells as osteosome uptake was delayed by neutralizing antibody against cadherin-11. Together, our studies suggest that osteosomes could have a unique role in the bone microenvironment under both physiological and pathological conditions.	PMC5860883

An Mtr4/ZFC3H1 complex facilitates turnover of unstable nuclear RNAs to prevent their cytoplasmic transport and global translational repression.	Genes Dev	2017	Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are unstable and rapidly degraded in the nucleus by the nuclear exosome. An exosome adaptor complex called NEXT (nuclear exosome targeting) functions to facilitate turnover of some of these lncRNAs. Here we show that knockdown of one NEXT subunit, Mtr4, but neither of the other two subunits, resulted in accumulation of two types of lncRNAs: prematurely terminated RNAs (ptRNAs) and upstream antisense RNAs (uaRNAs). This suggested a NEXT-independent Mtr4 function, and, consistent with this, we isolated a distinct complex containing Mtr4 and the zinc finger protein ZFC3H1. Strikingly, knockdown of either protein not only increased pt/uaRNA levels but also led to their accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, all pt/uaRNAs examined associated with active ribosomes, but, paradoxically, this correlated with a global reduction in heavy polysomes and overall repression of translation. Our findings highlight a critical role for Mtr4/ZFC3H1 in nuclear surveillance of naturally unstable lncRNAs to prevent their accumulation, transport to the cytoplasm, and resultant disruption of protein synthesis.

Exosomes Derived from Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Promote Tumor Growth Through Hedgehog Signaling Pathway.	Cell Physiol Biochem	2017	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are known to home to sites of tumor microenvironments where they participate in the formation of the tumor microenvironment and to interplay with tumor cells. However, the potential functional effects of MSCs on tumor cell growth are controversial. Here, we, from the view of bone marrow MSC-derived exosomes, study the molecular mechanism of MSCs on the growth of human osteosarcoma and human gastric cancer cells. METHODS: MSCs derived from human bone marrow (hBMSCs) were isolated and cultured in complete DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% exosome-depleted fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, cell culture supernatants containing exosomes were harvested and exosome purification was performed by ultracentrifugation. Osteosarcoma (MG63) and gastric cancer (SGC7901) cells, respectively, were treated with hBMSC-derived exosomes in the presence or absence of a small molecule inhibitor of Hedgehog pathway. Cell viability was measured by transwell invasion assay, scratch migration assay and CCK-8 test. The expression of the signaling molecules Smoothened, Patched-1, Gli1 and the ligand Shh were tested by western blot and RT-PCR. RESULTS: In this study, we found that hBMSC-derived exosomes promoted MG63 and SGC7901 cell growth through the activation of Hedgehog signaling pathway. Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling pathway significantly suppressed the process of hBMSC-derived exosomes on tumor growth. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the new roles of hedgehog signaling pathway in the hBMSCs-derived exosomes induced tumor progression.

New evidence that a large proportion of human blood plasma cell-free DNA is localized in exosomes.	PLoS One	2017	Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood is used as a source of genetic material for noninvasive prenatal and cancer diagnostic assays in clinical practice. Recently we have started a project for new biomarker discovery with a view to developing new noninvasive diagnostic assays. While reviewing literature, it was found that exosomes may be a rich source of biomarkers, because exosomes play an important role in human health and disease. While characterizing exosomes found in human blood plasma, we observed the presence of cfDNA in plasma exosomes. Plasma was obtained from blood drawn into K3EDTA tubes. Exosomes were isolated from cell-free plasma using a commercially available kit. Sizing and enumeration of exosomes were done using electron microscopy and NanoSight particle counter. NanoSight and confocal microscopy was used to demonstrate the association between dsDNA and exosomes. DNA extracted from plasma and exosomes was measured by a fluorometric method and a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method. Size of extracellular vesicles isolated from plasma was heterogeneous and showed a mean value of 92.6 nm and a mode 39.7 nm. A large proportion of extracellular vesicles isolated from plasma were identified as exosomes using a fluorescence probe specific for exosomes and three protein markers, Hsp70, CD9 and CD63, that are commonly used to identify exosome fraction. Fluorescence dye that stain dsDNA showed the association between exosomes and dsDNA. Plasma cfDNA concentration analysis showed more than 93% of amplifiable cfDNA in plasma is located in plasma exosomes. Storage of a blood sample showed significant increases in exosome count and exosome DNA concentration. This study provide evidence that a large proportion of plasma cfDNA is localized in exosomes. Exosome release from cells is a metabolic energy dependent process, thus suggesting active release of cfDNA from cells as a source of cfDNA in plasma.	PMC5574584
28895404	C Altaner				Exosomes of human mesenchymal stem/stromal/medicinal signaling cells.	Neoplasma	2017	In this review, we intend to explore the potential therapeutic effects of exosomes released from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). MSCs gained credibility as a therapeutic tool due to their potential to differentiate into many cell types like osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, muscular, endothelial, cardiovascular, and neurogenic cells. They possess potent wound healing activity due to their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. MSCs are tested in large number of clinical trials for treatment of diseases, which do not have adequate therapy at present. MSCs engineered to express suicide genes in preclinical studies have shown promising tumor targeting therapeutic tool for malignancies difficulty treatable at present. It has been increasingly observed in many different kinds of regenerative medicine and in MSCs mediated prodrug gene therapy for cancer that the intravenously administered of MSCs did not necessarily engraft at the site of injury or tumor. The therapeutic effect was exerted mainly through a paracrine action of rich secretome released from the cells. The main biocomponent of secretome are exosomes - naturally occurring membrane nanoparticles of 30-120 nm in diameter that mediate intercellular communication by delivering biomolecules like mRNA, miRNA into recipient cells. These nanosized exosomes derived from MSCs promise to be a new and valuable therapeutic strategy in regenerative medicine and cancer therapy compared with transplanted exogenous MSCs. Advantage of nanosized exosomes compared with administration of exogenous MSCs is multiple. Exosomes are easier to preserve and be transferred, have lower immunogenicity and therefore are safer for therapeutic administration.

Thromb Res	2017	INTRODUCTION: Cancer-associated thrombosis is one of the major causes of worse prognosis among tumor-bearing patients. Extracellular vesicles derived from cancer cells, which can be divided mainly into microvesicles and exosomes, can participate in several tumor progression phenomena. Tumor-derived microvesicles positive for tissue factor (TF) have been associated with thrombotic risk in certain cancer types. Cancer cell-derived exosomes, however, have not. In this study we evaluated the capacity of extracellular vesicles (EVs, containing both microvesicles and exosomes) derived from breast-cancer cell lines in promoting platelet activation, aggregation and plasma coagulation, in experiments that access both TF-dependent and -independent activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EVs were isolated from the conditioned media of two human mammary carcinoma cell lines: MDA-MB-231 (highly invasive) and MCF-7 (less invasive). TF-independent EV/platelet interaction, platelet P-selectin exposure and aggregation were evaluated. Western blotting, plasma clotting and platelet aggregation in the presence of plasma were performed for the measurement of TF-dependent activity in EVs. RESULTS: Interaction between MDA-MB-231 EVs and washed platelets led to increased platelet P-selectin exposure and platelet aggregation compared to MCF-7 EVs. MDA-MB-231 EVs had higher TF protein levels and TF-dependent procoagulant activity than MCF-7 EVs. Consequently, TF-dependent platelet aggregation was also induced by MDA-MB-231 EVs, but not by MCF-7 EVs. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that MDA-MB-231 EVs induce TF-independent platelet activation and aggregation, as well as TF-dependent plasma clotting and platelet aggregation by means of thrombin generation. In this context, aggressive breast cancer-derived EVs may contribute to cancer-associated thrombosis.

Electronic address: .	smoe@iu.edu		Matrix vesicles induce calcification of recipient vascular smooth muscle cells through multiple signaling pathways.	Kidney Int	2018	In patients with chronic kidney and end-stage renal diseases, the major risk factor for progression of arterial calcification is the presence of existing (baseline) calcification. Here, we tested whether calcification of arteries is extended from calcified vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to adjacent normal cells by matrix vesicle-induced alteration of cell signaling. Matrix vesicles isolated from VSMC of rats with chronic kidney disease were co-cultured with VSMCs from normal littermates. Endocytosis of vesicles by recipient cells was confirmed by confocal microscopy. The addition of cellular matrix vesicles with characteristics of exosomes and low fetuin-A content enhanced the calcification of recipient VSMC. Further, only cellular-derived matrix vesicles induced an increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration, NOX1 (NADPH oxidase) and the anti-oxidant superoxide dismutase-2 in recipient normal VSMC. The increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration was due to release from endoplasmic reticulum and partially attributed to the activation of both NOX1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK1 and Erk1/2) signaling, since inhibiting both pathways blocked the increase in intracellular calcium ion in recipient VSMC. In contrast, matrix vesicles isolated from the media had no effect on the intracellular calcium ion concentration or MEK1 signaling, and did not induce calcification. However, media matrix vesicles did increase Erk1/2, although not to the level of cellular matrix vesicles, and NOX1 expression. Blockade of NOX activity further inhibited the cellular matrix vesicle-induced accelerated calcification of recipient VSMC, suggesting a potential therapeutic role of such inhibition. Thus, addition of cellular-derived matrix vesicles from calcifying VSMC can accelerate calcification by inducing cell signaling changes and phenotypic alteration of recipient VSMC.

The Exosome Total Isolation Chip.	ACS Nano	2017	Circulating tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising source for identifying cancer biomarkers for early cancer detection. However, the clinical utility of EVs has thus far been limited by the fact that most EV isolation methods are tedious, nonstandardized, and require bulky instrumentation such as ultracentrifugation (UC). Here, we report a size-based EV isolation tool called ExoTIC (exosome total isolation chip), which is simple, easy-to-use, modular, and facilitates high-yield and high-purity EV isolation from biofluids. ExoTIC achieves an EV yield ∼4-1000-fold higher than that with UC, and EV-derived protein and microRNA levels are well-correlated between the two methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that ExoTIC is a modular platform that can sort a heterogeneous population of cancer cell line EVs based on size. Further, we utilize ExoTIC to isolate EVs from cancer patient clinical samples, including plasma, urine, and lavage, demonstrating the device's broad applicability to cancers and other diseases. Finally, the ability of ExoTIC to efficiently isolate EVs from small sample volumes opens up avenues for preclinical studies in small animal tumor models and for point-of-care EV-based clinical testing from fingerprick quantities (10-100 μL) of blood.

Mol Immunol	2018	Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease in the liver with potential to the development of liver fibrosis. Recent evidences suggest that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) may exert its therapeutic activity through exosomes. Moreover, miR-223 is highly expressed in BMSCs and plays an important role in autoimmune diseases. Therefore, in this study, hepatoprotective role of BMSCs and miR-223 was investigated in both mice and hepatocytes. Liver antigen S100 was used to establish autoimmune hepatitis model in mice while LPS and ATP were used to establish cell injury model in hepatocyte. Before the experiments, BMSCs were infected with pre-miR-223 and transfected with miR-223 inhibitor respectively. Exosomes from bone marrow stem cells were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Liver injury was evaluated by serum levels of ALT and AST as well as liver histology. Inflammation and cell death were examined by inflammatory cytokines and lactase dehydrogenase respectively. Both BMSCs-exo and BMSCs-exomiR-223(+) significantly reversed either S100 or LPS/ATP induced injury in mice and hepatocytes. Meanwhile, the expressions of cytokines, NLRP3 and caspase-1 were also downregulated by BMSCs-exo and BMSCs-exomiR-223(+) at both protein and mRNA levels in mice and hepatocytes. Moreover, BMSCs-exomiR-223(-) reverses the effects of BMSCs-exo and BMSCs-exomiR-223(+) in mouse AIH and in hepatocytes. In conclusion, bone marrow stem cell derived exosomes can protect liver injury in an experimental model of autoimmune hepatitis and the mechanism could be related to exosomal miR-223 regulation of NLRP3 and caspase-1.

Methods Mol Biol	2018	Exosomes are small (~100 nm) vesicles that carry a wide range of molecules including proteins, RNAs, and DNA. Exosomes are secreted from a wide range of cells including placental cells. Interestingly, exosomes secreted from placental cells have been identified in maternal circulation as early as in 6 weeks of gestation, and their concentration increases with the gestational age. While there is growing interest in elucidating the role of exosomes during normal and complicated pregnancies (such as preeclampsia), progress in the field has been delayed because of the inability to isolate placental exosomes from maternal circulation. Therefore, here we describe a workflow to isolate placental exosomes from maternal circulation.

BMC Genomics	2017	BACKGROUND: Exosomes and other extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as an important mechanism of cell-to-cell communication. However, previous studies either did not fully resolve what genetic materials were shuttled by exosomes or only focused on a specific set of miRNAs and mRNAs. A more systematic method is required to identify the genetic materials that are potentially transferred during cell-to-cell communication through EVs in an unbiased manner. RESULTS: In this work, we present a novel next generation of sequencing (NGS) based approach to identify EV mediated mRNA exchanges between co-cultured adipocyte and macrophage cells. We performed molecular and genomic profiling and jointly considered data from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and genotyping to track the "sequence varying mRNAs" transferred between cells. We identified 8 mRNAs being transferred from macrophages to adipocytes and 21 mRNAs being transferred in the opposite direction. These mRNAs represented biological functions including extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, glycoprotein, and signal peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Our study sheds new light on EV mediated RNA communications between adipocyte and macrophage cells, which may play a significant role in developing insulin resistance in diabetic patients. This work establishes a new method that is applicable to examining genetic material exchanges in many cellular systems and has the potential to be extended to in vivo studies as well.	PMC5741891

Plasma Exosomes and Improvements in Endothelial Function by Angiotensin 2 Type 1 Receptor or Cyclooxygenase 2 Blockade following Intermittent Hypoxia.	Front Neurol	2017	Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is associated with increased endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disorders. Exosomes released in biological fluids may act as vehicles for propagating such damage, modifying the functional phenotype of endothelial cells. Drug interventions, however, may provide protection for the endothelium, in spite of exosomal activity. Using an experimental human model of IH, we investigated whether the beneficial effects of two drugs, celecoxib (CEL) and losartan (LOS), on IH-induced vascular dysfunction was mediated via exosomes or independent of IH-induced exosomal cargo alterations. We hypothesized that the beneficial effects of CEL and LOS on IH-induced vascular dysfunction would be mediated via modifications of exosomal properties by the drugs, rather than by direct effects of the drugs on the endothelium. Ten male volunteers were exposed to IH (single exposure of 6 h) while receiving LOS, CEL, or placebo (P) for 4 days before IH exposures, and plasma samples were obtained from which exosomes were isolated, and incubated with naïve human endothelial cell cultures either not treated or pretreated with LOS, CEL, or P. Functional reporter assays (monolayer impedance, monocyte adhesion, and eNOS phosphorylation) revealed that the degree of exosome-induced endothelial dysfunction was similar among IH-exposed subjects independent of drug treatment. However, pretreatment of naïve endothelial cells with LOS or CEL before addition of exosomes from IH-exposed subjects afforded significant protection. Thus, the cardiovascular protective impact of LOS and CEL appears to be mediated by their direct effects on endothelial cells, rather than via modulation of exosomal cargo.	PMC5743928

Transl Oncol	2018	Exosomes are extracellular membrane vesicles of 50- to 130-nm diameter secreted by most tumor cells. Exosomes can mediate the intercellular transfer of proteins and RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), and promote both tumorigenesis and premetastatic niche formation. In this study, we performed exosomal RNA sequencing to identify candidate exosomal miRNAs that could be associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) and its distant metastasis. The expression profiles of exosomal miRNA, as secreted by isogenic human primary CRC cell line SW480 and highly metastatic cell line SW620, were analyzed and the potential targets related to tumorigenesis and metastatic progression were investigated. We found that 25 miRNAs had been up-regulated and 5 miRNAs had been down-regulated in exosomes purified from SW620 culture supernatant. Candidate miRNAs were further evaluated for CRC diagnosis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in CRC patients. Higher expression levels of circulating exosomal miR-17-5p and miR-92a-3p were significantly associated with pathologic stages and grades of the CRC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating exosomal miR-17-5p and miR-92a-3p may provide a promising noninvasive prognostic biomarker for primary and metastatic CRC.	PMC5789766

Extracellular vesicles have variable dose-dependent effects on cultured draining cells in the eye.	J Cell Mol Med	2018	The role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as signal mediators has been described in many biological fields. How many EVs are needed to deliver the desired physiological signal is yet unclear. Using a normal trabecular meshwork (NTM) cell culture exposed to non-pigmented ciliary epithelium (NPCE)-derived EVs, a relevant model for studying the human ocular drainage system, we addressed the EVs dose-response effects on the Wnt signaling. The objective of the study was to investigate the dosing effects of NPCE-derived EVs on TM Wnt signaling. EVs were isolated by PEG 8000 method from NPCE and RPE cells (used as controls) conditioned media. Concentrations were determined by Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing method. Various exosomes concentration were incubated with TM cells, for the determination of mRNA (β-Catenin, Axin2 and LEF1) and protein (β-Catenin, GSK-3β) expression using real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. Exposure of NTM cells for 8 hrs to low EVs concentrations was associated with a significant decreased expression of β-Catenin, GSK-3β, as opposed to exposure to high exosomal concentrations. Pro-MMP9 and MMP9 activities were significantly enhanced in NTM cells treated with high EV concentrations of (X10) as compared to low EV concentrations of either NPCE- or RPE-derived EVs and to untreated control. Our data support the concept that EVs biological effects are concentration-dependent at their target site. Specifically in the present study, we described a general dose-response at the gene and MMPs activity and a different dose-response regarding key canonical Wnt proteins expression.	PMC5824413

J Mol Neurosci	2018	Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has poor outcomes due to high mortality and morbidity, but until now, the effective treatments remain limited. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are vital regulators of gene expression and demonstrated to be linked to the pathogenesis of various central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Exosomes are considered as cell-to-cell communication vectors and secreted largely by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). The present study investigated the role of miR-133b delivered by exosomes secreted from MSCs to brain tissues in rats after ICH. An autologous arterial blood ICH model in adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was used in this study. At 72 h after transfection with miR-133b mimics in MSCs, miR-133b-modified MSC-derived exosomes were collected from medium of MSCs and then injected to rats via tail vein. The levels of miR-133b in secreted exosomes and brain tissues of rats in various groups and the levels of RhoA, phosphorylations of extracellular signal regulating kinase (ERK1/2), and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were detected by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The effects of miR-133b on neuronal apoptosis and degeneration were respectively evaluated by TUNEL and fluoro-jade B staining. The miR-133b levels were reduced in brain tissues of rats at 24 h and peaked at 72 h after ICH. At 24 h after miR-133b-modified exosome administration, the level of miR-133b was significantly increased, while the apoptotic and neurodegenerative neurons were obviously reduced in brain tissues after ICH. The results of western blot analysis showed that miR-133b modified exosomes treatment remarkably suppressed RhoA expression and activated ERK1/2/CREB in brain tissues after ICH. Collectively, our investigation suggested that exosomes derived from miR-133b modified MSCs exhibited neuroprotective role for anti-apoptotic effect of miR-133b mediating RhoA and ERK1/2/CREB in rats after ICH.

Mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes are more immunosuppressive than microparticles in inflammatory arthritis.	Theranostics	2018	Objectives: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that display a therapeutic effect in inflammatory disease models. Although MSCs can prevent arthritis, the role of MSCs-derived EVs has never been reported in rheumatoid arthritis. This prompted us to compare the function of exosomes (Exos) and microparticles (MPs) isolated from MSCs and investigate their immunomodulatory function in arthritis. Methods: MSCs-derived Exos and MPs were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation. Immunosuppressive effects of MPs or Exos were investigated on T and B lymphocytes in vitro and in the Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) and Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) models. Results: Exos and MPs from MSCs inhibited T lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and decreased the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. Interestingly, Exos increased Treg cell populations while parental MSCs did not. Conversely, plasmablast differentiation was reduced to a similar extent by MSCs, Exos or MPs. IFN-γ priming of MSCs before vesicles isolation did not influence the immunomodulatory function of isolated Exos or MPs. In DTH, we observed a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of MPs and Exos, while in the CIA model, Exos efficiently decreased clinical signs of inflammation. The beneficial effect of Exos was associated with fewer plasmablasts and more Breg-like cells in lymph nodes. Conclusions: Both MSCs-derived MPs and Exos exerted an anti-inflammatory role on T and B lymphocytes independently of MSCs priming. However, Exos were more efficient in suppressing inflammation in vivo. Our work is the first demonstration of the therapeutic potential of MSCs-derived EVs in inflammatory arthritis.	PMC5835945

Biochim Biophys Acta	2018	PKH lipophilic dyes are highly fluorescent and stain membranes by intercalating their aliphatic portion into the exposed lipid bilayer. They have established use in labeling and tracking of cells in vivo and in vitro. Despite wide use of PKH-labeled extracellular vesicles (EVs) in cell targeting and functional studies, nonEV-associated fluorescent structures have never been examined systematically, nor was their internalization by cells. Here, we have characterized PKH26-positive particles in lymphoblastoid B exosome samples and exosome-free controls stained by ultracentrifugation, filtration, and sucrose-cushion-based and sucrose-gradient-based procedures, using confocal imaging and asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation coupled to multi-angle light-scattering detector analysis. We show for the first time that numerous PKH26 nanoparticles (nine out of ten PKH26-positive particles) are formed during ultracentrifugation-based exosome staining, which are almost indistinguishable from PKH26-labeled exosomes in terms of size, surface area, and fluorescence intensity. When PKH26-labeled exosomes were purified through sucrose, PKH26 nanoparticles were differentiated from PKH26-labeled exosomes based on their reduced size. However, PKH26 nanoparticles were only physically removed from PKH26-labeled exosomes when separated on a sucrose gradient, and at the expense of low PKH26-labeled exosome recovery. Overall, low PKH26-positive particle recovery is characteristic of filtration-based exosome staining. Importantly, PKH26 nanoparticles are internalized by primary astrocytes into similar subcellular compartments as PKH26-labeled exosomes. Altogether, PKH26 nanoparticles can result in false-positive signals for stained EVs that can compromise the interpretation of EV internalization. Thus, for use in EV uptake and functional studies, sucrose-gradient-based isolation should be the method of choice to obtain PKH26-labeled exosomes devoid of PKH26 nanoparticles.

Diffusion Tensor Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Reveals Exosomes From Cardiosphere-Derived Cells Preserve Myocardial Fiber Architecture After Myocardial Infarction.	JACC Basic Transl Sci	2018	The object of the study was to reveal the fiber microstructural response with diffusion tensor cardiac magnetic resonance after intramyocardial exosomes secreted by cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCEXO) in chronic porcine myocardial infarction. Porcine with myocardial infarction underwent intramyocardial delivery of human CDCEXO and placebo in a randomized placebo-controlled study. Four weeks after injection, viability improved in the CDCEXO group, whereas myocardial fiber architecture and cardiac function were preserved. In the placebo group, fiber architecture and cardiac function declined. Myocardial regeneration by CDCEXO is not tumor-like; instead, details of tissue architecture are faithfully preserved, which may foster physiological excitation and contraction.	PMC5869026

Mol Hum Reprod	2018	STUDY QUESTION: Is it possible to improve fibrosis in endometriosis by microRNA-214 delivery in exosomes? SUMMARY ANSWER: Upregulation of miR-214 may inhibit fibrogenesis and its delivery by exosomes derived from ectopic endometrial stromal cells, offers an alternative therapeutic approach for endometriosis fibrosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Fibrosis is the primary pathological feature of endometriosis. MiR-214 plays an important role in fibrotic disease. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a critical fibrogenic mediator of miR-214. The expression of miR-214 is decreased in ectopic endometrial stromal cells compared with normal endometrial stromal cells. miRNAs are a natural cargo of exosomes and these could be exploited as carriers of miRNA in replacement therapy. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Paired eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissue samples were obtained from 10 women with ovarian endometrioma. Endometrial stromal cells and epithelial cells from both were cultured in vitro. RT-PCR,western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to study the effect of transfection with miR-214 mimics on CTGF expression and fibrogenesis respectively, with and without TGFβ stimulation. Exosomes were isolated from ectopic endometrial stromal cells and Endometrioma tissue was isolated from 4 patients, dispersed an injected (ip) into nude mice and allowed to implant. The mice were treated with miR-214-enriched exosomes or controls to confirm the effect of inhibiting CTGF overexpression on endometriosis fibrosis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The primary ectopic endometrial stromal cells were transfected with miR-214 mimics. The levels of miR-214, CTGF and fibrotic markers were measured by RT-PCR and Immunohistochemistry. A mouse model of endometriosis was established by ip injection of human ectopic endometrial tissues into nude mice. MiR-214-enriched exosomes were injected into the mice and endometriotic lesions were measured on day 28. Changes in fibrosis of the endometriotic implants were studied by histopathological staining. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: CTGF and fibrotic markers up-regulation in endometriosis is associated with a reciprocal down-regulation of miR-214. By using miR-214 mimics and antagomirs to investigate expression of fibrotic markers, we found that increased production of miR-214 reduced Collagen αI and CTGF expression in endometriosis stromal and endometrial epithelial cells in response to fibrosis-inducing stimuli (p < 0.001 versus non-treatment). Ectopic endometrial stromal cells yielded nano-sized exosomes which expressed miR-214. Loading exosomes with miR-214 mimics and injecting them into an experimental endometriosis mouse model resulted in a decrease in the expression of fibrosis-associated proteins (p < 0.001 versus PBS control group). LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: We only isolated exosomes from ectopic endometrial stromal cells, whether this is the optimum source requires further study. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Upregulation of miRNA-214 potentially offers an alternative therapeutic approach for endometriosis fibrosis.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been found to be effective in pre-clinical animal models and clinical trials, but the mechanisms by which they induce cardioprotection and repair are still not fully understood. Small extracellular vesicles known as exosomes are now recognized to be key mediators of beneficial MSC paracrine effects, and the concept that they transfer miRNA to change gene expression in recipient cells is of current therapeutic interest. We present complete deep miRNA sequencing of MSC exosome cargo, and found that of several cardioprotective miRNAs, miR-21a-5p was the most abundant. Because miR-21a-5p is a well-known cardioprotective miRNA, we investigated the hypothesis that MSC exosomes can cardioprotect the heart by increasing the level of miR-21a-5p in recipient cardiac cells, thereby downregulating expression of the pro-apoptotic gene products PDCD4, PTEN, Peli1 and FasL in the myocardium. Using miR-21 mimic transfection and treatment with wild type and miR-21a knockout MSC exosomes, we confirmed that exosomal miR-21a-5p is transferred into myocardium and is a major cardioprotective paracrine factor produced by MSCs acting via synergistic activity on multiple pathways. The data supports that residual cardioprotective effect may be due to other ncRNA or protein cargo. In silico analyses support that MSC exosomes may also contribute to angiogenesis, cell proliferation and other aspects of cardiac repair.

Targeting and Therapy of Glioblastoma in a Mouse Model Using Exosomes Derived From Natural Killer Cells.	Front Immunol	2018	Objective: Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor that is resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Natural killer (NK) cells have been used to treat incurable cancers. Recent studies have investigated the effectiveness of NK-cell-derived exosomes (NK-Exo) for treating incurable cancers such as melanoma, leukemia, and neuroblastoma; however, NK-Exo have not been used to treat glioblastoma. In the present study, we investigated the antitumor effects of NK-Exo against aggressive glioblastoma both in vitro and in vivo and determined the tumor-targeting ability of NK-Exo by performing fluorescence imaging. Methods: U87/MG cells were transfected with the enhanced firefly luciferase (effluc) and thy1.1 genes; thy1.1-positive cells were selected using microbeads. U87/MG/F cells were assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, and luciferase-activity assays. NK-Exo were isolated by ultracentrifugation, purified by density gradient centrifugation, and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA), and western blotting. Cytokine levels in NK-Exo were compared to those in NK cells and NK-cell medium by performing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NK-Exo-induced apoptosis of cancer cells was confirmed by flow cytometry and western blotting. In vivo therapeutic effects and specificity of NK-Exo against glioblastoma were assessed in a xenograft mouse model by fluorescence imaging. Xenograft mice were treated with NK-Exo, which was administered seven times through the tail vein. Tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and tumor volume was measured by ultrasound imaging. The mice were intraperitoneally injected with dextran sulfate 2 h before NK-Exo injection to decrease the liver uptake and increase the tumor specificity of NK-Exo. Results: RT-PCR and western blotting confirmed the gene and protein expression of effluc in U87/MG/F cells, with the bioluminescence activity of U87/MG/F cells increasing with an increase in cell number. NTA and DLS results indicated that the size of NK-Exo was ~100 nm, and the western blot results confirmed that NK-Exo expressed exosome markers CD63 and Alix. We confirmed the in vitro cytotoxic effects of NK-Exo on U87/MG/F cells by performing BLI, and the killing effect on U87/MG and U87MG/F cells was measured by CCK-8 and MTT assays (p < 0.001). ELISA results indicated that NK-Exo contained tumor necrosis factor-α and granzyme B. In vivo NK-Exo treatment inhibited tumor growth compared to in control mice (p < 0.001), and pretreatment of xenograft mice with dextran sulfate 2 h before NK-Exo treatment increased the antitumor effect of NK-Exo (p < 0.01) compared to in control and NK-Exo-alone-treated mice. Conclusion: NK-Exo targeted and exerted antitumor effects on glioblastoma cells both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting their utility in treating incurable glioblastoma.	PMC5924812

Oncogene	2018	Tumor self-seeding occurs when circulating malignant cells reinfiltrate the original tumor. The process may breed more aggressive tumor cells, which may contribute to cancer progression. In this study, we observed tumor self-seeding in mouse xenograft models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for the first time. We confirmed that circulating tumor cell uptake of tumor-derived exosomes, which are increasingly recognized as key instigators of cancer progression by facilitating cell-cell communication, promoted tumor self-seeding by enhancing the invasive and migration capability of recipient HCC cells. Horizontal transfer of exosomal microRNA-25-5p to anoikis-resistant HCC cells significantly enhanced their migratory and invasive abilities, whereas inhibiting microRNA-25-5p alleviated these effects. Our experiments delineate an exosome-based novel pathway employed by functional microRNA from the original tumor cells that can influence the biological fate of circulating tumor cells.	
8642258	H J Geuze	Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Institute for Biomembranes, Utrecht University, The Netherlands.			B lymphocytes secrete antigen-presenting vesicles.	J Exp Med	1996	Antigen-presenting cells contain a specialized late endocytic compartment, MIIC (major histocompatibility complex [MHC] class II-enriched compartment), that harbors newly synthesized MHC class II molecules in transit to the plasma membrane. MIICs have a limiting membrane enclosing characteristic internal membrane vesicles. Both the limiting membrane and the internal vesicles contain MHC class II. In this study on B lymphoblastoid cells, we demonstrate by immunoelectron microscopy that the limiting membrane of MIICs can fuse directly with the plasma membrane, resulting in release from the cells of internal MHC class II-containing vesicles. These secreted vesicles, named exosomes, were isolated from the cell culture media by differential centrifugation followed by flotation on sucrose density gradients. The overall surface protein composition of exosomes differed significantly from that of the plasma membrane. Exosome-bound MHC class II was in a compact, peptide-bound conformation. Metabolically labeled MHC class II was released into the extracellular medium with relatively slow kinetics, 10 +/- 4% in 24 h, indicating that direct fusion of MIICs with the plasma membrane is not the major pathway by which MHC class II reaches the plasma membrane. Exosomes derived from both human and murine B lymphocytes induced antigen-specific MHC class II-restricted T cell responses. These data suggest a role for exosomes in antigen presentation in vivo.

Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol	2004	Exosomes are membrane vesicles from endosomal origin secreted by various cells such as hematopoietic, epithelial, and tumor cells. Exosomes secreted by tumor cells contain specific antigens potentially useful for immunotherapeutic purposes. Our aim was to determine if exosomes are present in human cancerous pleural effusions and to identify their proteomic content. Exosomes were purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and electron microscopy was used to check both concentration and purity of exosomes. Proteins were separated by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein bands were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and Western blotting. Exosomes were present in pleural fluid obtained from patients suffering from mesothelioma (n = 4), lung cancer (n = 2), breast cancer (n = 2), and ovarian cancer (n = 1). As previously reported by others, antigen-presenting molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, and signal transduction-involved proteins were present. Proteins not previously reported were identified (SNX25, BTG1, PEDF, thrombospondin 2). Different types of immunoglobulins and complement factors were abundantly present in the sucrose fractions containing exosomes. Exosome-directed specificity of these immunoglobulins was not observed. In conclusion, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation allows isolation of exosomes from malignant pleural effusions. However, pleural fluid proteins and especially immunoglobulins are coisolated and may hamper the use of exosomes isolated from malignant effusion for immunotherapy programs.

More efficient induction of HLA-A*0201-restricted and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-specific CTL response by immunization with exosomes prepared from heat-stressed CEA-positive tumor cells.	Clin Cancer Res	2005	PURPOSE: Tumor-derived exosomes are proposed as a new type of cancer vaccine. Heat shock proteins are potent Th1 adjuvant, and heat stress can induce heat shock protein and MHC-I expression in tumor cells, leading to the increased immunogenicity of tumor cells. To improve the immunogenicity of exosomes as cancer vaccine, we prepared exosomes from heat-stressed carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-positive tumor cells (CEA+/HS-Exo) and tested the efficacy of these exosomes in the induction of CEA-specific antitumor immunity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: First, we identified the composition of CEA+/HS-Exo and observed their effects on human dendritic cell maturation. Then, we evaluated their ability to induce a CEA-specific immune response in vivo in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice and CEA-specific CTL response in vitro in HLA-A*0201+ healthy donors and HLA-A*0201+CEA+ cancer patients. RESULTS: CEA+/HS-Exo contained CEA and more heat shock protein 70 and MHC-I and significantly induced dendritic cell maturation. Immunization of HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice with CEA+/HS-Exo was more efficient in priming a CEA-specific CTL, and the CTL showed antitumor effect when adoptively transferred to SW480-bearing nude mice. Moreover, in vitro incubation of lymphocytes from HLA-A*0201+ healthy donors and HLA-A*0201+CEA+ cancer patients with CEA+/HS-Exo-pulsed autologous dendritic cells induces HLA-A*0201-restricted and CEA-specific CTL response. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that CEA+/HS-Exo has superior immunogenicity than CEA+/Exo in inducing CEA-specific CTL response and suggest that exosomes derived from heat-stressed tumor cells may be used as efficient vaccine for cancer immunotherapy.

J Cell Biochem	2007	AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of numerous mammalian transcripts function as instability elements that promote rapid mRNA degradation. Tristetraprolin (TTP) is an ARE-binding protein that promotes rapid mRNA decay through mechanisms that are poorly understood. A 31 nucleotide ARE sequences from the TNF-alpha 3' UTR promoted TTP-dependent mRNA decay when it was inserted into the 3' UTR of a beta-globin reporter transcript, indicating that this short sequence was sufficient for TTP function. We used a gel shift assay to identify a TTP-containing complex in cytoplasmic extracts from TTP-transfected HeLa cells that bound specifically to short ARE sequences. This TTP-containing complex also contained the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1 and the exosome component PM-scl75 because it was super-shifted with anti-Xrn1 or anti-PMscl75 antibodies. RNA affinity purification verified that these proteins associated specifically with ARE sequences in a TTP-dependent manner. Using a competition binding assay, we found that the TTP-containing complex bound with high affinity to short ARE sequences from GM-CSF, IL-3, TNF-alpha, IL-2, and c-fos, but did not bind to a U-rich sequence from c-myc, a 22 nucleotide poly U sequence or a mutated GM-CSF control sequence. High affinity binding by the TTP-containing complex correlated with TTP-dependent deadenylation and decay of capped, polyadenylated transcripts in a cell-free mRNA decay assay, suggesting that the TTP-containing complex was functional. These data support a model whereby TTP functions to enhance mRNA decay by recruiting components of the cellular mRNA decay machinery to the transcript.

Crit Care	2007	INTRODUCTION: Several studies link hematological dysfunction to severity of sepsis. Previously we showed that platelet-derived microparticles from septic patients induce vascular cell apoptosis through the NADPH oxidase-dependent release of superoxide. We sought to further characterize the microparticle-dependent vascular injury pathway. METHODS: During septic shock there is increased generation of thrombin, TNF-alpha and nitric oxide (NO). Human platelets were exposed for 1 hour to the NO donor diethylamine-NONOate (0.5 microM), lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/ml), TNF-alpha (40 ng/ml), or thrombin (5 IU/ml). Microparticles were recovered through filtration and ultracentrifugation and analyzed by electron microscopy, flow cytometry or Western blotting for protein identification. Redox activity was characterized by lucigenin (5 microM) or coelenterazine (5 microM) luminescence and by 4,5-diaminofluorescein (10 mM) and 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (10 mM) fluorescence. Endothelial cell apoptosis was detected by phosphatidylserine exposure and by measurement of caspase-3 activity with an enzyme-linked immunoassay. RESULTS: Size, morphology, high exposure of the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81, together with low phosphatidylserine, showed that platelets exposed to NONOate and LPS, but not to TNF-alpha or thrombin, generate microparticles similar to those recovered from septic patients, and characterize them as exosomes. Luminescence and fluorescence studies, and the use of specific inhibitors, revealed concomitant superoxide and NO generation. Western blots showed the presence of NO synthase II (but not isoforms I or III) and of the NADPH oxidase subunits p22phox, protein disulfide isomerase and Nox. Endothelial cells exposed to the exosomes underwent apoptosis and caspase-3 activation, which were inhibited by NO synthase inhibitors or by a superoxide dismutase mimetic and totally blocked by urate (1 mM), suggesting a role for the peroxynitrite radical. None of these redox properties and proapoptotic effects was evident in microparticles recovered from platelets exposed to thrombin or TNF-alpha. CONCLUSION: We showed that, in sepsis, NO and bacterial elements are responsible for type-specific platelet-derived exosome generation. Those exosomes have an active role in vascular signaling as redox-active particles that can induce endothelial cell caspase-3 activation and apoptosis by generating superoxide, NO and peroxynitrite. Thus, exosomes must be considered for further developments in understanding and treating vascular dysfunction in sepsis.	PMC2556756

Exosomes from bronchoalveolar fluid of tolerized mice prevent allergic reaction.	J Immunol	2008	Exosomes are nanovesicles originating from multivesicular bodies that are secreted by a variety of cell types. The dual capability of exosomes to promote immunity or to induce tolerance has prompted their clinical use as vehicles for vaccination against different human diseases. In the present study, the effect of allergen-specific exosomes from tolerized mice on the development of allergen-induced allergic response was determined using a mouse model. Mice were tolerized by respiratory exposure to the olive pollen allergen Ole e 1. Exosome-like vesicles were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the animals by the well-established filtration and ultracentrifugation procedure, characterized by electron microscopy, Western blot, and FACS analyses, and assessed in a prophylactic protocol. To this end, BALB/c mice were intranasally treated with tolerogenic exosomes or naive exosomes as control, 1 wk before sensitization/challenge to Ole e 1. Blood, lungs, and spleen were collected and analyzed for immune responses. Intranasal administration of tolerogenic exosomes inhibited the development of IgE response, Th2 cytokine production, and airway inflammation--cardinal features of allergy--and maintained specific long-term protection in vivo. This protective effect was associated with a concomitant increase in the expression of the regulatory cytokine TGF-beta. These observations demonstrate that exosomes can induce tolerance and protection against allergic sensitization in mice. Thus, exosome-based vaccines could represent an alternative to conventional therapy for allergic diseases in humans.

Nucleic Acids Res	2009	The modification or degradation of RNAs including miRNAs may play vital roles in regulating RNA functions. The polyadenylation- and exosome-mediated RNA decay is involved in the degradation of plant RNAs including the primary miRNA processing intermediates. However, plant miRNA levels are not affected by exosome depletion. Here, we report the cloning of a large number of 5' and/or 3' truncated versions of the known miRNAs from various tissues of Populus trichocarpa (black cottonwood). It suggests that plant miRNAs may be degraded through either 5' to 3' or 3' to 5' exonucleolytic digestion. We also show that a significant portion of the isolated miRNAs contains, at the 3'-end, one or a few post-transcriptionally added adenylic acid residues, which are distinct in length from the polyadenylate tail added to other plant RNAs for exosome-mediated degradation. Using an in vitro miRNA degradation system, where synthesized miRNA oligos were degraded in extracts of P. trichocarpa cells, we revealed that the adenylated miRNAs were degraded slower than others without adenylation. It indicates that addition of adenylic acid residues on the 3'-end plays a negative role in miRNA degradation. Our results provide new information for understanding the mechanism of miRNA degradation.	PMC2665221

KSRP-PMR1-exosome association determines parathyroid hormone mRNA levels and stability in transfected cells.	BMC Cell Biol	2009	BACKGROUND: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene expression is regulated post-transcriptionally through the binding of the trans-acting proteins AU rich binding factor 1 (AUF1), Upstream of N-ras (Unr) and KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) to an AU rich element (ARE) in PTH mRNA 3'-UTR. AUF1 and Unr stabilize PTH mRNA while KSRP, recruiting the exoribonucleolytic complex exosome, promotes PTH mRNA decay. RESULTS: PTH mRNA is cleaved by the endoribonuclease polysomal ribonuclease 1 (PMR1) in an ARE-dependent manner. Moreover, PMR1 co-immunoprecipitates with PTH mRNA, the exosome and KSRP. Knock-down of either exosome components or KSRP by siRNAs prevents PMR1-mediated cleavage of PTH mRNA. CONCLUSION: PTH mRNA is a target for the endonuclease PMR1. The PMR1 mediated decrease in PTH mRNA levels involves the PTH mRNA 3'-UTR ARE, KSRP and the exosome. This represents an unanticipated mechanism by which the decay of an ARE-containing mRNA is facilitated by KSRP and is dependent on both the exosome and an endoribonuclease.	PMC2759919

Bystander suppression to unrelated allergen sensitization through intranasal administration of tolerogenic exosomes in mouse.	Mol Immunol	2010	Exosomes represent a new family of bioactive nanovesicles (30-100 nm in diameter) secreted by different cell types whose appealing features can be exploited for designing vaccines in the context of several human diseases. We previously reported the potential of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)-derived tolerogenic exosomes (Exo(Tol)) to be used as a nasal allergy vaccine in a mouse model of sensitization to Ole e 1, the main allergen of olive pollen. The aim of the study was to investigate whether such nanovesicles specific to Ole e 1 can also prevent the sensitization to other unrelated allergen, as Bet v 1 from birch pollen. Exo(Tol) were isolated from BALF of mice tolerized against Ole e 1 and used in a prophylactic approach. BALB/c mice were intranasally pretreated with Exo(Tol) one week before sensitization/challenge with Bet v 1, and the magnitude of allergen-specific response was analyzed. Intranasal pretreatment with Exo(Tol) resulted in significant inhibition of both specific IgE and IgG1 antibodies levels. Moreover, T cells from mice pretreated with Exo(Tol) showed a reduction in IL-5 and IL-13 (Th2 cytokines) production. Lung inflammatory response triggered by unrelated allergen-challenge was also significantly reduced after pretreatment: perivascular/peribronchial inflammatory cell infiltration, eosinophilia and mucus secretion. In conclusion, Exo(Tol) specific to Ole e 1, in addition to inhibit specific immune response to this allergen, blocked the allergic response to a second unrelated allergen such as Bet v 1. The in vivo "bystander suppression" that we herein describe for Exo(Tol) may have implications for the treatment of allergy based on mucosal tolerance induction.	
20949044	Keiichi Ohshima	Medical Genetics Division, Shizuoka Cancer Center Research Institute, Shizuoka, Japan. 	k.ohshima@scchr.jp		Let-7 microRNA family is selectively secreted into the extracellular environment via exosomes in a metastatic gastric cancer cell line.	PLoS One	2010	BACKGROUND: Exosomes play a major role in cell-to-cell communication, targeting cells to transfer exosomal molecules including proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) by an endocytosis-like pathway. miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules on average 22 nucleotides in length that regulate numerous biological processes including cancer pathogenesis and mediate gene down-regulation by targeting mRNAs to induce RNA degradation and/or interfering with translation. Recent reports imply that miRNAs can be stably detected in circulating plasma and serum since miRNAs are packaged by exosomes to be protected from RNA degradation. Thus, profiling exosomal miRNAs are in need to clarify intercellular signaling and discover a novel disease marker as well. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Exosomes were isolated from cultured cancer cell lines and their quality was validated by analyses of transmission electron microscopy and western blotting. One of the cell lines tested, a metastatic gastric cancer cell line, AZ-P7a, showed the highest RNA yield in the released exosomes and distinctive shape in morphology. In addition, RNAs were isolated from cells and culture media, and profiles of these three miRNA fractions were obtained using microarray analysis. By comparing signal intensities of microarray data and the following validation using RT-PCR analysis, we found that let-7 miRNA family was abundant in both the intracellular and extracellular fractions from AZ-P7a cells, while low metastatic AZ-521, the parental cell line of AZ-P7a, as well as other cancer cell lines showed no such propensity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The enrichment of let-7 miRNA family in the extracellular fractions, particularly, in the exosomes from AZ-P7a cells may reflect their oncogenic characteristics including tumorigenesis and metastasis. Since let-7 miRNAs generally play a tumor-suppressive role as targeting oncogenes such as RAS and HMGA2, our results suggest that AZ-P7a cells release let-7 miRNAs via exosomes into the extracellular environment to maintain their oncogenesis.

J Proteomics	2011	To better understand the role of exosomes in the trabecular meshwork (TM), the site of intraocular pressure control, the exosome proteome from primary cultures of human TM cell monolayers was analyzed. Exosomes were purified from urine and conditioned media from primary cultures of human TM cell monolayers and subjected to a two dimensional HPLC separation and MS/MS analyses using the MudPIT strategy. Spectra were searched against a human protein database using Sequest. Protein profiles were compared to each other and the Exocarta database and the presence of specific protein markers confirmed by Western blot analyses of exosomes from aqueous humor and human TM cell strains (n=5) that were untreated, or exposed to dexamethasone and/or ionomycin. TM cell exosomes contained 108 of the 143 most represented exosome proteins in ExoCarta, including previously characterized markers such as membrane organizing and tetraspanin proteins. Several cell-specific proteins in TM exosomes were identified including myocilin, emilin-1 and neuropilin-1. All TM exosome proteins had flotation densities on sucrose gradients and release responses to ionomycin typical for exosomes. Taken together, TM exosomes have a characteristic exosome protein profile plus contain unique proteins, including the glaucoma-causing protein, myocilin; suggesting a role for exosomes in the control of intraocular pressure.

Hepatology	2011	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by a propensity for multifocality, growth by local spread, and dysregulation of multiple signaling pathways. These features may be determined by the tumoral microenvironment. The potential of tumor cells to modulate HCC growth and behavior by secreted proteins has been extensively studied. In contrast, the potential for genetic modulation is poorly understood. We investigated the role and involvement of tumor-derived nanovesicles capable of altering gene expression and characterized their ability to modulate cell signaling and biological effects in other cells. We show that HCC cells can produce nanovesicles and exosomes that differ in both RNA and protein content from their cells of origin. These can be taken up and internalized by other cells and can transmit a functional transgene. The microRNA (miRNA) content of these exosomes was examined, and a subset highly enriched within exosomes was identified. A combinatorial approach to identify potential targets identified transforming growth factor β activated kinase-1 (TAK1) as the most likely candidate pathway that could be modulated by these miRNAs. Loss of TAK1 has been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis and is a biologically plausible target for intercellular modulation. We show that HCC cell-derived exosomes can modulate TAK1 expression and associated signaling and enhance transformed cell growth in recipient cells. CONCLUSION: Exosome-mediated miRNA transfer is an important mechanism of intercellular communication in HCC cells. These observations identify a unique intercellular mechanism that could potentially contribute to local spread, intrahepatic metastases, or multifocal growth in HCC.	PMC3310362

Exosome-associated tau is secreted in tauopathy models and is selectively phosphorylated in cerebrospinal fluid in early Alzheimer disease.	J Biol Chem	2012	Recent demonstrations that the secretion, uptake, and interneuronal transfer of tau can be modulated by disease-associated tau modifications suggest that secretion may be an important element in tau-induced neurodegeneration. Here, we show that much of the tau secreted by M1C cells occurs via exosomal release, a widely characterized mechanism that mediates unconventional secretion of other aggregation-prone proteins (α-synuclein, prion protein, and β-amyloid) in neurodegenerative disease. Exosome-associated tau is also present in human CSF samples and is phosphorylated at Thr-181 (AT270), an established phosphotau biomarker for Alzheimer disease (AD), in both M1C cells and in CSF samples from patients with mild (Braak stage 3) AD. A preliminary analysis of proteins co-purified with tau in secreted exosomes identified several that are known to be involved in disease-associated tau misprocessing. Our results suggest that exosome-mediated secretion of phosphorylated tau may play a significant role in the abnormal processing of tau and in the genesis of elevated CSF tau in early AD.	PMC3281682

Novel CD8+ T cell-based vaccine stimulates Gp120-specific CTL responses leading to therapeutic and long-term immunity in transgenic HLA-A2 mice.	Vaccine	2012	The limitations of highly active anti-retroviral therapy have necessitated the development of alternative therapeutics for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-infected patients with dysfunctional dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4(+) T cell deficiency. We previously demonstrated that HIV-1 Gp120-specific T cell-based Gp120-Texo vaccine by using ConA-stimulated C57BL/6 (B6) mouse CD8(+) T (ConA-T) cells with uptake of pcDNA(Gp120)-transfected B6 mouse DC line DC2.4 (DC2.4(Gp120))-released exosomes (EXO(Gp120)) was capable of stimulating DC and CD4(+) T cell-independent CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses detected in wild-type B6 mice using non-specific PE-anti-CD44 and anti-IFN-γ antibody staining by flow cytometry. To assess effectiveness of Gp120-Texo vaccine in transgenic (Tg) HLA-A2 mice mimicking the human situation, we constructed adenoviral vector AdV(Gp120) expressing HIV-1 GP120 by recombinant DNA technology, and generated Gp120-Texo vaccine by using Tg HLA-A2 mouse CD8(+) ConA-T cells with uptake of AdV(Gp120)-transfected HLA-A2 mouse bone marrow DC (DC(Gp120))-released EXO(Gp120). We then performed animal studies to assess Gp120-Texo-induced stimulation of Gp120-specific CTL responses and antitumor immunity in Tg HLA-A2 mice. We demonstrate that Gp120-Texo vaccine stimulates Gp120-specific CTL responses detected in Tg HLA-A2 mice using Gp120-specific PE-HLA-A2/Gp120 peptide (KLTPLCVTL) tetramer staining by flow cytometry. These Gp120-specific CTLs are capable of further differentiating into functional effectors with killing activity to Gp120 peptide-pulsed splenocytes in vivo. In addition, Gp120-Texo vaccine also induces Gp120-specific preventive, therapeutic (for 6 day tumor lung metastasis) and CD4(+) T cell-independent long-term immunity against B16 melanoma BL6-10(Gp120/A2Kb) expressing both Gp120 and A2Kb (α1 and α2 domains of HLA-A2 and α3 domain of H-2K(b)) in Tg HLA-A2 mice. Taken together, the novel CD8(+) Gp120-Texo vaccine capable of stimulating efficient CD4(+) T cell-independent Gp120-specific CD8(+) CTL responses leading to therapeutic and long-term immunity in Tg HLA-A2 mice may represent a new immunotherapeutic vaccine for treatment of HIV-1 patients with CD4(+) T cell deficiency.

Exosomes isolated from mycobacteria-infected mice or cultured macrophages can recruit and activate immune cells in vitro and in vivo.	J Immunol	2012	More than 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium. tuberculosis; however, only 5-10% of those infected will develop active disease. Recent data suggest that containment is controlled locally at the level of the granuloma and that granuloma architecture may differ even within a single infected individual. Formation of a granuloma likely requires exposure to mycobacterial components released from infected macrophages, but the mechanism of their release is still unclear. We hypothesize that exosomes, which are small membrane vesicles containing mycobacterial components released from infected macrophages, could promote cellular recruitment during granuloma formation. In support of this hypothesis, we found that C57BL/6 mouse-derived bone marrow macrophages treated with exosomes released from M. tuberculosis-infected RAW264.7 cells secrete significant levels of chemokines and can induce migration of CFSE-labeled macrophages and splenocytes. Exosomes isolated from the serum of M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin-infected mice could also stimulate macrophage production of chemokines and cytokines ex vivo, but the level and type differed during the course of a 60-d infection. Of interest, the exosome concentration in serum correlated strongly with mouse bacterial load, suggesting some role in immune regulation. Finally, hollow fiber-based experiments indicated that macrophages treated with exosomes released from M. tuberculosis-infected cells could promote macrophage recruitment in vivo. Exosomes injected intranasally could also recruit CD11b(+) cells into the lung. Overall, our study suggests that exosomes may play an important role in recruiting and regulating host cells during an M. tuberculosis infection.	PMC3685416

Hypoxic enhancement of exosome release by breast cancer cells.	BMC Cancer	2012	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted by tumour cells which have roles in paracrine signalling during tumour progression, including tumour-stromal interactions, activation of proliferative pathways and bestowing immunosuppression. Hypoxia is an important feature of solid tumours which promotes tumour progression, angiogenesis and metastasis, potentially through exosome-mediated signalling. METHODS: Breast cancer cell lines were cultured under either moderate (1% O2) or severe (0.1% O2) hypoxia. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media and quantitated by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting for the exosomal protein CD63 in order to assess the impact of hypoxia on exosome release. Hypoxic exosome fractions were assayed for miR-210 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and normalised to exogenous and endogenous control genes. Statistical significance was determined using the Student T test with a P value of < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Exposure of three different breast cancer cell lines to moderate (1% O2) and severe (0.1% O2) hypoxia resulted in significant increases in the number of exosomes present in the conditioned media as determined by NTA and CD63 immunoblotting. Activation of hypoxic signalling by dimethyloxalylglycine, a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) hydroxylase inhibitor, resulted in significant increase in exosome release. Transfection of cells with HIF-1α siRNA prior to hypoxic exposure prevented the enhancement of exosome release by hypoxia. The hypoxically regulated miR-210 was identified to be present at elevated levels in hypoxic exosome fractions. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that hypoxia promotes the release of exosomes by breast cancer cells, and that this hypoxic response may be mediated by HIF-1α. Given an emerging role for tumour cell-derived exosomes in tumour progression, this has significant implications for understanding the hypoxic tumour phenotype, whereby hypoxic cancer cells may release more exosomes into their microenvironment to promote their own survival and invasion.

Fluids Barriers CNS	2013	BACKGROUND: In addition to possessing intracellular vesicles, eukaryotic cells also produce extracellular microvesicles, ranging from 50 to 1000 nm in diameter that are released or shed into the microenvironment under physiological and pathological conditions. These membranous extracellular organelles include both exosomes (originating from internal vesicles of endosomes) and ectosomes (originating from direct budding/shedding of plasma membranes). Extracellular microvesicles contain cell-specific collections of proteins, glycoproteins, lipids, nucleic acids and other molecules. These vesicles play important roles in intercellular communication by acting as carrier for essential cell-specific information to target cells. Endothelial cells in the brain form the blood-brain barrier, a specialized interface between the blood and the brain that tightly controls traffic of nutrients and macromolecules between two compartments and interacts closely with other cells forming the neurovascular unit. Therefore, brain endothelial cell extracellular microvesicles could potentially play important roles in 'externalizing' brain-specific biomarkers into the blood stream during pathological conditions, in transcytosis of blood-borne molecules into the brain, and in cell-cell communication within the neurovascular unit. METHODS: To study cell-specific molecular make-up and functions of brain endothelial cell exosomes, methods for isolation of extracellular microvesicles using mass spectrometry-compatible protocols and the characterization of their signature profiles using mass spectrometry -based proteomics were developed. RESULTS: A total of 1179 proteins were identified in the isolated extracellular microvesicles from brain endothelial cells. The microvesicles were validated by identification of almost 60 known markers, including Alix, TSG101 and the tetraspanin proteins CD81 and CD9. The surface proteins on isolated microvesicles could potentially interact with both primary astrocytes and cortical neurons, as cell-cell communication vesicles. Finally, brain endothelial cell extracellular microvesicles were shown to contain several receptors previously shown to carry macromolecules across the blood brain barrier, including transferrin receptor, insulin receptor, LRPs, LDL and TMEM30A. CONCLUSIONS: The methods described here permit identification of the molecular signatures for brain endothelial cell-specific extracellular microvesicles under various biological conditions. In addition to being a potential source of useful biomarkers, these vesicles contain potentially novel receptors known for delivering molecules across the blood-brain barrier.	PMC3560214

First identification of Ewing's sarcoma-derived extracellular vesicles and exploration of their biological and potential diagnostic implications.	Biol Cell	2013	BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Exosomes are small RNA- and protein-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are thought to mediate hetero- and homotypic intercellular communication between normal and malignant cells.Tumour-derived exosomes are believed to promote re-programming of the tumour-associated stroma to favour tumour growth and metastasis. Currently, exosomes have been intensively studied in carcinomas. However, little is known about their existence and possible role in sarcomas. RESULTS: Here, we report on the identification of vesicles with exosomal features derived from Ewing's sarcoma(ES), the second most common soft-tissue or bone cancer in children and adolescents. ES cell line-derived EV shave been isolated by ultracentrifugation and analysed by flow-cytometric assessment of the exosome-associated proteins CD63 and CD81 as well as by electron microscopy. They proved to contain ES-specific transcripts including EWS-FLI1, which were suitable for the sensitive detection of ES cell line-derived exosomes by qRT-PCRin a pre-clinical model for patient plasma. Microarray analysis of ES cell line-derived exosomes revealed that they share a common transcriptional signature potentially involved in G-protein-coupled signalling, neurotransmitter signalling and stemness. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our results imply that ES-derived exosomes could eventually serve as biomarkers for minimal residual disease diagnostics in peripheral blood and prompt further investigation of their potential biological role in modification of the ES-associated microenvironment

Exosome-mediated transmission of hepatitis C virus between human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells.	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	2013	Recent evidence indicates there is a role for small membrane vesicles, including exosomes, as vehicles for intercellular communication. Exosomes secreted by most cell types can mediate transfer of proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs, but their role in the transmission of infectious agents is less established. Recent studies have shown that hepatocyte-derived exosomes containing hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA can activate innate immune cells, but the role of exosomes in the transmission of HCV between hepatocytes remains unknown. In this study, we investigated whether exosomes transfer HCV in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Purified exosomes isolated from HCV-infected human hepatoma Huh7.5.1 cells were shown to contain full-length viral RNA, viral protein, and particles, as determined by RT-PCR, mass spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Exosomes from HCV-infected cells were capable of transmitting infection to naive human hepatoma Huh7.5.1 cells and establishing a productive infection. Even with subgenomic replicons, lacking structural viral proteins, exosome-mediated transmission of HCV RNA was observed. Treatment with patient-derived IgGs showed a variable degree of neutralization of exosome-mediated infection compared with free virus. In conclusion, this study showed that hepatic exosomes can transmit productive HCV infection in vitro and are partially resistant to antibody neutralization. This discovery sheds light on neutralizing antibodies resistant to HCV transmission by exosomes as a potential immune evasion mechanism.	PMC3740869

Tumor-derived exosomes are enriched in ΔNp73, which promotes oncogenic potential in acceptor cells and correlates with patient survival.	Hum Mol Genet	2014	Tumor-derived exosomes are emerging as local and systemic cell-to-cell mediators of oncogenic information through the horizontal transfer of mRNAs, microRNAs and proteins during tumorigenesis. The exosomal content has been described as biologically active when taken up by the recipient cell. Identifying the specific molecular cargo of exosomes will help to determine their function in specific steps of the tumorigenic process. Here we evaluate whether ΔNp73 is selectively packaged in tumor-derived exosomes, its function in the acceptor cells in vitro and in vivo and its prognosis potential in cancer. ΔNp73 messenger is enriched in tumor-derived exosomes, suggesting its active sorting in these microvesicles. We observed the transmission of this exosome cargo to different cell types and how it confers proliferation potential and chemoresistance to the acceptor cells in vitro and in animal models. Finally, our data support the potential prognostic value of exosomal ΔNp73 in colon cancer patients.

Profiling circulating microRNA expression in experimental sepsis using cecal ligation and puncture.	PLoS One	2013	The levels of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in mice with experimental sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) were determined using whole blood samples obtained from C57BL/6 mice at 4, 8, and 24 h after CLP; miRNA expression analysis was performed in these samples using an miRNA array. Microarray analysis revealed upregulation of 10 miRNA targets (miR-16, miR-17, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-26a, miR-26b, miR-106a, miR-106b, miR-195, and miR-451). The expression of these miRNA targets in the whole blood, serum, and white blood cells (WBCs) of CLP mice was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR; these values were compared to those in sham-operated C57BL/6 mice, and the results indicated that these miRNA targets were significantly up-regulated in the whole blood and serum but not in the WBCs. In addition, the levels of these 10 miRNA targets in the serum of Tlr2-/-, Tlr4-/-, and NF-κB-/- mice at 8 h after CLP did not decrease significantly., which indicated that the transcription of these miRNAs was not directly mediated by the TLR2/NF-κB or TLR4/NF-κB pathway, and pathways induced by exposure to the gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. Immunoprecipitation with the Argonaute 2 ribonucleoprotein complex revealed significantly increased expression of the 10 miRNA targets in the serum of mice after CLP, and the levels of 6 (miR-16, miR-17, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-26a, and miR-26b) of these 10 miRNA targets increased significantly in exosomes isolated using ExoQuick precipitation solution. In this study, we identified circulating miRNAs that were up-regulated after CLP and determined the increase in the levels of these miRNAs, and our results suggest that circulating Ago2 complexes and exosomes may be responsible for the stability of miRNAs in the serum.

Electronic address: .	edit.buzas@gmail.com		Improved circulating microparticle analysis in acid-citrate dextrose (ACD) anticoagulant tube.	Thromb Res	2014	INTRODUCTION: Recently extracellular vesicles (exosomes, microparticles also referred to as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies) have attracted substantial interest as potential biomarkers and therapeutic vehicles. However, analysis of microparticles in biological fluids is confounded by many factors such as the activation of cells in the blood collection tube that leads to in vitro vesiculation. In this study we aimed at identifying an anticoagulant that prevents in vitro vesiculation in blood plasma samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the levels of platelet microparticles and non-platelet-derived microparticles in platelet-free plasma samples of healthy donors. Platelet-free plasma samples were isolated using different anticoagulant tubes, and were analyzed by flow cytometry and Zymuphen assay. The extent of in vitro vesiculation was compared in citrate and acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) tubes. RESULTS: Agitation and storage of blood samples at 37 °C for 1 hour induced a strong release of both platelet microparticles and non-platelet-derived microparticles. Strikingly, in vitro vesiculation related to blood sample handling and storage was prevented in samples in ACD tubes. Importantly, microparticle levels elevated in vivo remained detectable in ACD tubes. CONCLUSIONS: We propose the general use of the ACD tube instead of other conventional anticoagulant tubes for the assessment of plasma microparticles since it gives a more realistic picture of the in vivo levels of circulating microparticles and does not interfere with downstream protein or RNA analyses.

Exosomes in Plasma of Patients with Ovarian Carcinoma: Potential Biomarkers of Tumor Progression and Response to Therapy.	Gynecol Obstet (Sunnyvale)	2013	BACKGROUND: In patients with Ovarian Cancer (OvCa) exosomes released by tumor cells are present in the plasma and could be involved in tumor progression. This study examines the association between the exosome presence/protein content in plasma of OvCa patients and disease outcome, response to standard therapy and/or tumorresistance to therapies in patients studied at diagnosis and also serially during and after therapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: Exosomes were purified from OvCa patients' plasma (n=22), patients with benign tumors (n=10) or (n=10) healthy controls (NC) using ultracentrifugation. Exosomes were visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Their protein content was measured. The presence of MAGE 3/6 and TGF-β1 in exosomes was evaluated in Western blots. RESULTS: The OvCa patients' plasma contained higher levels of exosomal proteins (p<0.05) compared to those isolated from plasma of patients with benign tumors or NC. Exosomes isolated from OvCa patients's plasma carried TGF-β1 and MAGE3/6, which distinguished OvCa patients from those with benign tumors and NC. High protein levels of exosomes were seen in newly diagnosed patients; however in advanced stages of OvCa patients the protein content of isolated exosomes was significantly higher than that of early stages. The exosome levels variably changed during/after chemotherapy, and correlations between the changes in exosomal protein levels and clinical data suggested that the protein content of exosomes might be useful in predicting responses to therapy and prognosis in OvCa patients. CONCLUSION: Analysis of plasma exosomes levels offers a novel approach to diagnosis and monitoring response to therapies in OvCa patients.	PMC3899646

J Gen Virol	2014	Human pegivirus (HPgV; previously called GB virus C/hepatitis G virus) has limited pathogenicity, despite causing persistent infection, and is associated with prolonged survival in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals. Although HPgV RNA is found in and produced by T- and B-lymphocytes, the primary permissive cell type(s) are unknown. We quantified HPgV RNA in highly purified CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells, including naïve, central memory and effector memory populations, and in B-cells (CD19(+)), NK cells (CD56(+)) and monocytes (CD14(+)) using real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Single-genome sequencing was performed on viruses within individual cell types to estimate genetic diversity among cell populations. HPgV RNA was present in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes (nine of nine subjects), B-lymphocytes (seven of ten subjects), NK cells and monocytes (both four of five). HPgV RNA levels were higher in naïve (CD45RA(+)) CD4(+) cells than in central memory and effector memory cells (P<0.01). HPgV sequences were highly conserved among subjects (0.117±0.02 substitutions per site; range 0.58-0.14) and within subjects (0.006±0.003 substitutions per site; range 0.006-0.010). The non-synonymous/synonymous substitution ratio was 0.07, suggesting a low selective pressure. Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labelled HPgV RNA-containing particles precipitated by a commercial exosome isolation reagent delivered CSFE to uninfected monocytes, NK cells and T- and B-lymphocytes, and HPgV RNA was transferred to PBMCs with evidence of subsequent virus replication. Thus, HPgV RNA-containing serum particles including microvesicles may contribute to delivery of HPgV to PBMCs in vivo, explaining the apparent broad tropism of this persistent human RNA virus.

FASEB J	2014	Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that mediate intercellular communication and are involved in several biological processes. The objective of our study was to determine whether endogenous retrovirus group WE, member l (ERVWE1)/syncytin-1 and endogenous retrovirus group FRD, member 1 (ERVFRDE1)/syncytin-2, encoded by human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) envelope (env) genes, are present at the surface of exosomes produced by placenta-derived villous cytotrophoblasts and whether they play a role in cellular uptake of exosomes. In addition, we sought to determine whether these proteins are present in various abundances in serum-derived exosomes from normal pregnant women vs. women with preeclampsia (PE). Isolated exosomes were analyzed for their content by Western blot, a bead-associated flow cytometry approach, and a syncytin-2 ELISA. Binding and uptake were tested through confocal and electron microscopy using the BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line. Quality control of exosome preparations consisted of detection of exosomal and nonexosomal markers. Exosome-cell interactions were compared between cells incubated in the presence of control exosomes, syncytin-1 or syncytin-2-deprived exosomes, or exosomes solely bearing the uncleaved forms of these HERV env proteins. From our data, we conclude that villous cytotrophoblast exosomes are positive for both env proteins and are rapidly taken up by BeWo cells in a syncytin-1- and syncytin-2-dependent manner and that syncytin-2 is reduced in serum-derived exosomes from women with PE when compared to exosomes from normal pregnant women.

Electronic address: .	cmaguire@mgh.harvard.edu		Naturally enveloped AAV vectors for shielding neutralizing antibodies and robust gene delivery in vivo.	Biomaterials	2014	Recently adeno-associated virus (AAV) became the first clinically approved gene therapy product in the western world. To develop AAV for future clinical application in a widespread patient base, particularly in therapies which require intravenous (i.v.) administration of vector, the virus must be able to evade pre-existing antibodies to the wild type virus. Here we demonstrate that in mice, AAV vectors associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) can evade human anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies. We observed different antibody evasion and gene transfer abilities with populations of EVs isolated by different centrifugal forces. EV-associated AAV vector (ev-AAV) was up to 136-fold more resistant over a range of neutralizing antibody concentrations relative to standard AAV vector in vitro. Importantly in mice, at a concentration of passively transferred human antibodies which decreased i.v. administered standard AAV transduction of brain by 80%, transduction of ev-AAV transduction was not reduced and was 4000-fold higher. Finally, we show that expressing a brain targeting peptide on the EV surface allowed significant enhancement of transduction compared to untargeted ev-AAV. Using ev-AAV represents an effective, clinically relevant approach to evade human neutralizing anti-AAV antibodies after systemic administration of vector.	PMC4104587

Cavin-1/PTRF alters prostate cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicle content and internalization to attenuate extracellular vesicle-mediated osteoclastogenesis and osteoblast proliferation.	J Extracell Vesicles	2014	BACKGROUND: Tumour-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role in tumour progression; however, the spectrum of molecular mechanisms regulating EV secretion and cargo selection remain to be fully elucidated. We have reported that cavin-1 expression in prostate cancer PC3 cells reduced the abundance of a subset of EV proteins, concomitant with reduced xenograft tumour growth and metastasis. METHODS: We examined the functional outcomes and mechanisms of cavin-1 expression on PC3-derived EVs (PC3-EVs). RESULTS: PC3-EVs were internalized by osteoclast precursor RAW264.7 cells and primary human osteoblasts (hOBs) in vitro, stimulating osteoclastogenesis 37-fold and hOB proliferation 1.5-fold, respectively. Strikin gly, EVs derived from cavin-1-expressing PC3 cells (cavin-1-PC3-EVs) failed to induce multinucleate osteoblasts or hOB proliferation. Cavin-1 was not detected in EVs, indicating an indirect mechanism of action. EV morphology, size and quantity were also not affected by cavin-1 expression, suggesting that cavin-1 modulated EV cargo recruitment rather than release. While cavin-1-EVs had no osteoclastogenic function, they were internalized by RAW264.7 cells but at a reduced efficiency compared to control EVs. EV surface proteins are required for internalization of PC3-EVs by RAW264.7 cells, as proteinase K treatment abolished uptake of both control and cavin-1-PC3-EVs. Removal of sialic acid modifications by neuraminidase treatment increased the amount of control PC3-EVs internalized by RAW264.7 cells, without affecting cavin-1-PC3-EVs. This suggests that cavin-1 expression altered the glycosylation modifications on PC3-EV surface. Finally, cavin-1 expression did not affect EV in vivo tissue targeting as both control and cavin-1-PC3-EVs were predominantly retained in the lung and bone 24 hours after injection into mice. DISCUSSION: Taken together, our results reveal a novel pathway for EV cargo sorting, and highlight the potential of utilizing cavin-1-mediated pathways to attenuate metastatic prostate cancer.

Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci	2014	Homeostasis relies heavily on effective cell-to-cell communication. In the central nervous system (CNS), probably more so than in other organs, such communication is crucial to support and protect neurons especially during ageing, as well as to control inflammation, remove debris and infectious agents. Emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) including endosome-derived exosomes and fragments of the cellular plasma membrane play a key role in intercellular communication by transporting messenger RNA, microRNA (miRNA) and proteins. In neurodegenerative diseases, secreted vesicles not only remove misfolded proteins, but also transfer aggregated proteins and prions and are thus thought to perpetuate diseases by 'infecting' neighbouring cells with these pathogenic proteins. Conversely, in other CNS disorders signals from stressed cells may help control inflammation and inhibit degeneration. EVs may also reflect the status of the CNS and are present in the cerebrospinal fluid indicating that exosomes may act as biomarkers of disease. That extracellular RNA and in particular miRNA, can be transferred by EV also indicates that these vesicles could be used as carriers to specifically target the CNS to deliver immune modulatory drugs, neuroprotective agents and anti-cancer drugs. Here, we discuss the recent evidence indicating the potential role of exosomes in neurological disorders and how knowledge of their biology may enable a Trojan-horse approach to deliver drugs into the CNS and treat neurodegenerative and other disorders of the CNS.

Exosomes secreted by nematode parasites transfer small RNAs to mammalian cells and modulate innate immunity.	Nat Commun	2014	In mammalian systems RNA can move between cells via vesicles. Here we demonstrate that the gastrointestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus, which infects mice, secretes vesicles containing microRNAs (miRNAs) and Y RNAs as well as a nematode Argonaute protein. These vesicles are of intestinal origin and are enriched for homologues of mammalian exosome proteins. Administration of the nematode exosomes to mice suppresses Type 2 innate responses and eosinophilia induced by the allergen Alternaria. Microarray analysis of mouse cells incubated with nematode exosomes in vitro identifies Il33r and Dusp1 as suppressed genes, and Dusp1 can be repressed by nematode miRNAs based on a reporter assay. We further identify miRNAs from the filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis in the serum of infected mice, suggesting that miRNA secretion into host tissues is conserved among parasitic nematodes. These results reveal exosomes as another mechanism by which helminths manipulate their hosts and provide a mechanistic framework for RNA transfer between animal species.	PMC4263141

Analysis of exosome purification methods using a model liposome system and tunable-resistive pulse sensing.	Sci Rep	2015	Exosomes are vesicles which have garnered interest due to their diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Isolation of pure yields of exosomes from complex biological fluids whilst preserving their physical characteristics is critical for downstream applications. In this study, we use 100 nm-liposomes from 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and cholesterol as a model system as a model system to assess the effect of exosome isolation protocols on vesicle recovery and size distribution using a single-particle analysis method. We demonstrate that liposome size distribution and ζ-potential are comparable to extracted exosomes, making them an ideal model for comparison studies. Four different purification protocols were evaluated, with liposomes robustly isolated by three of them. Recovered yields varied and liposome size distribution was unaltered during processing, suggesting that these protocols do not induce particle aggregation. This leads us to conclude that the size distribution profile and characteristics of vesicles are stably maintained during processing and purification, suggesting that reports detailing how exosomes derived from tumour cells differ in size to those from normal cells are reporting a real phenomenon. However, we hypothesize that larger particles present in most purified exosome samples represent co-purified contaminating non-exosome debris. These isolation techniques are therefore likely nonspecific and may co-isolate non-exosome material of similar physical properties.	PMC4648344

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. At the time of diagnosis, more than half of the patients will have disseminated disease and, yet, diagnosing can be challenging. New methods are desired to improve the diagnostic work-up. Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles displaying various proteins on their membrane surfaces. In addition, they are readily available in blood samples where they constitute potential biomarkers of human diseases, such as cancer. Here, we examine the potential of distinguishing non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients from control subjects based on the differential display of exosomal protein markers. METHODS: Plasma was isolated from 109 NSCLC patients with advanced stage (IIIa-IV) disease and 110 matched control subjects initially suspected of having cancer, but diagnosed to be cancer free. The Extracellular Vesicle Array (EV Array) was used to phenotype exosomes directly from the plasma samples. The array contained 37 antibodies targeting lung cancer-related proteins and was used to capture exosomes, which were visualised with a cocktail of biotin-conjugated CD9, CD63 and CD81 antibodies. RESULTS: The EV Array analysis was capable of detecting and phenotyping exosomes in all samples from only 10 µL of unpurified plasma. Multivariate analysis using the Random Forests method produced a combined 30-marker model separating the two patient groups with an area under the curve of 0.83, CI: 0.77-0.90. The 30-marker model has a sensitivity of 0.75 and a specificity of 0.76, and it classifies patients with 75.3% accuracy. CONCLUSION: The EV Array technique is a simple, minimal-invasive tool with potential to identify lung cancer patients.	PMC4348413

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as important mediators of intercellular communication in a diverse range of biological processes. For future therapeutic applications and for EV biology research in general, understanding the in vivo fate of EVs is of utmost importance. Here we studied biodistribution of EVs in mice after systemic delivery. EVs were isolated from 3 different mouse cell sources, including dendritic cells (DCs) derived from bone marrow, and labelled with a near-infrared lipophilic dye. Xenotransplantation of EVs was further carried out for cross-species comparison. The reliability of the labelling technique was confirmed by sucrose gradient fractionation, organ perfusion and further supported by immunohistochemical staining using CD63-EGFP probed vesicles. While vesicles accumulated mainly in liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract and lungs, differences related to EV cell origin were detected. EVs accumulated in the tumour tissue of tumour-bearing mice and, after introduction of the rabies virus glycoprotein-targeting moiety, they were found more readily in acetylcholine-receptor-rich organs. In addition, the route of administration and the dose of injected EVs influenced the biodistribution pattern. This is the first extensive biodistribution investigation of EVs comparing the impact of several different variables, the results of which have implications for the design and feasibility of therapeutic studies using EVs.

J Extracell Vesicles	2015	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a significant role in cell-cell communication in numerous physiological processes and pathological conditions, and offer promise as novel biomarkers and therapeutic agents for genetic diseases. Many recent studies have described different molecular mechanisms that contribute to EV biogenesis and release from cells. However, little is known about how external stimuli such as cell culture conditions can affect the quantity and content of EVs. While N2a neuroblastoma cells cultured in serum-free (OptiMEM) conditions did not result in EVs with significant biophysical or size differences compared with cells cultured in serum-containing (pre-spun) conditions, the quantity of isolated EVs was greatly increased. Moreover, the expression levels of certain vesicular proteins (e.g. small GTPases, G-protein complexes, mRNA processing proteins and splicing factors), some of which were previously reported to be involved in EV biogenesis, were found to be differentially expressed in EVs under different culture conditions. These data, therefore, contribute to the understanding of how extracellular factors and intracellular molecular pathways affect the composition and release of EVs.	PMC4447833

Glypican-1 identifies cancer exosomes and detects early pancreatic cancer.	Nature	2015	Exosomes are lipid-bilayer-enclosed extracellular vesicles that contain proteins and nucleic acids. They are secreted by all cells and circulate in the blood. Specific detection and isolation of cancer-cell-derived exosomes in the circulation is currently lacking. Using mass spectrometry analyses, we identify a cell surface proteoglycan, glypican-1 (GPC1), specifically enriched on cancer-cell-derived exosomes. GPC1(+) circulating exosomes (crExos) were monitored and isolated using flow cytometry from the serum of patients and mice with cancer. GPC1(+) crExos were detected in the serum of patients with pancreatic cancer with absolute specificity and sensitivity, distinguishing healthy subjects and patients with a benign pancreatic disease from patients with early- and late-stage pancreatic cancer. Levels of GPC1(+) crExos correlate with tumour burden and the survival of pre- and post-surgical patients. GPC1(+) crExos from patients and from mice with spontaneous pancreatic tumours carry specific KRAS mutations, and reliably detect pancreatic intraepithelial lesions in mice despite negative signals by magnetic resonance imaging. GPC1(+) crExos may serve as a potential non-invasive diagnostic and screening tool to detect early stages of pancreatic cancer to facilitate possible curative surgical therapy.	PMC4825698

J Neurosci	2015	Recent evidence suggests that tau aggregation may spread via extracellular release and subsequent uptake by synaptically connected neurons, but little is known about the processes by which tau is released or the molecular forms of extracellular tau. To gain insight into the nature of extracellular tau, we used highly sensitive ELISAs, which, when used in tandem, are capable of differentiating between full-length (FL) tau, mid-region-bearing fragments, and C-terminal (CT) fragments. We applied these assays to the systematic study of the conditioned media of N2a cells, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human cortical neurons, and primary rat cortical neurons, each of which was carefully assessed for viability. In all three neuronal models, the bulk of extracellular tau was free-floating and unaggregated and <0.2% was encapsulated in exosomes. Although most intracellular tau was FL, the majority of extracellular tau was CT truncated and appeared to be released both actively by living neurons and passively by dead cells. In contrast, only a small amount of extracellular tau was aggregation-competent tau (i.e., contained the microtubule-binding regions) and this material appears to be released solely due to a low level of cell death that occurs in all cell culture systems. Importantly, amyloid β-protein (Aβ)-induced neuronal compromise significantly increased the quantity of all forms of extracellular tau, but the presence of Aβ before detectable cell compromise did not increase extracellular tau. Collectively, these results suggest that factors that induce neuronal death are likely to be necessary to initiate the extracellular spread of tau aggregation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Recent studies suggest that the transfer of tau between neurons underlies the characteristic spatiotemporal progression of neurofibrillary pathology. We searched for tau in the conditioned medium of N2a cells, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human cortical neurons, and primary rat cortical neurons and analyzed the material present using four different tau ELISAs. We demonstrate that the majority of tau released from healthy neurons is C-terminally truncated and lacks the microtubule-binding region (MTBR) thought necessary for self-aggregation. A small amount of MTBR-containing tau is present outside of cells, but this appears to be solely due to cell death. Therefore, if propagation of tau aggregation is mediated by extracellular tau, our findings suggest that neuronal compromise is required to facilitate this process.

Cell Metab	2015	Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) has been used to treat human diseases, but the detailed mechanisms underlying its success are not fully understood. Here we show that MSCT rescues bone marrow MSC (BMMSC) function and ameliorates osteopenia in Fas-deficient-MRL/lpr mice. Mechanistically, we show that Fas deficiency causes failure of miR-29b release, thereby elevating intracellular miR-29b levels, and downregulates DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) expression in MRL/lpr BMMSCs. This results in hypomethylation of the Notch1 promoter and activation of Notch signaling, in turn leading to impaired osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, we show that exosomes, secreted due to MSCT, transfer Fas to recipient MRL/lpr BMMSCs to reduce intracellular levels of miR-29b, which results in recovery of Dnmt1-mediated Notch1 promoter hypomethylation and thereby improves MRL/lpr BMMSC function. Collectively our findings unravel the means by which MSCT rescues MRL/lpr BMMSC function through reuse of donor exosome-provided Fas to regulate the miR-29b/Dnmt1/Notch epigenetic cascade.	PMC4731233

Membrane vesicle-mediated release of bacterial RNA.	Sci Rep	2015	Many Gram-negative bacterial species release outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that interact with the host by delivering virulence factors. Here, we report for the first time that RNA is among the wide variety of bacterial components that are associated with OMVs. To characterize the RNA profiles of bacterial OMVs, we performed RNA deep sequencing analysis using OMV samples isolated from a wild type Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor strain. The results showed that RNAs originating from intergenic regions were the most abundant. Our findings reveal a hitherto unrecognised feature of OMVs mimicking eukaryotic exosomes and highlight a need to evaluate the potential role of RNA-containing bacterial membrane vesicles in bacteria-host interactions.

Cardiovasc Res	2016	AIMS: Cardiomyocytes (CMs) and endothelial cells (ECs) have an intimate anatomical relationship, which is essential for maintaining the metabolic requirements of the heart. Little is known about the mechanisms that regulate nutrient flow from ECs to associated CMs, especially in situations of acute stress when local active processes are required to regulate endothelial transport. We examined whether CM-derived exosomes can modulate glucose transport and metabolism in ECs. METHODS AND RESULTS: In conditions of glucose deprivation, CMs increase the synthesis and secretion of exosomes. These exosomes are loaded with functional glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes, which are internalized by ECs, leading to increased glucose uptake, glycolytic activity, and pyruvate production in recipient cells. CONCLUSION: These findings establish CM-derived exosomes as key components of the cardio-endothelial communication system which, through intercellular protein complementation, would allow a rapid response from ECs to increase glucose transport and a putative uptake of metabolic fuels from blood to CMs. This CM-EC protein complementation process might have implications for metabolic regulation in health and disease.

J Gastrointestin Liver Dis	2015	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and second in women. The aim of the current study was to identify whether the miR-375 is indeed down-regulated in metastatic CRC and if it could be considered as a potential minimally invasive prognostic biomarker for CRC. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated and characterized from patients with liver metastasis from CCR. The characterization of exosome was performed using TEM/SEM. HCT116 cells were treated with miR-375 mimic, NSM and miR-375 inhibitor. Functional assays included cell counting assay for 14 days, Matrigel invasion assay, apoptosis assay by flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC, RT-PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: Increased proliferation potential was proven for the cells transfected with miR-375 inhibitor, while the miR-375 mimic decreased the cell number. The cells transfected with the miR-375 inhibitor are aggressive and cross the membrane; 3.84% of the cells transfected with the miR-375 inhibitor entered apoptosis, while 6.45% of those transfected with the non-specific mimic were in programmed cell death, less than those transfected with the microRNA. RT-PCR for Bcl-2 expression showed that Bcl-2 is down-regulated for miR-375 inhibitor and up-regulated for the miR-375 mimic, a result confirmed by Western blotting. CONCLUSION: The present study brings to the forefront new data that suggest miR-375 as a new player in controlling the pathways responsible for inhibiting the natural history of CRC tumor cells, via the Bcl-2 pathway.

Expression of the Long Non-Coding RNA HOTAIR Correlates with Disease Progression in Bladder Cancer and Is Contained in Bladder Cancer Patient Urinary Exosomes.	PLoS One	2016	Exosomes are 30-150nM membrane-bound secreted vesicles that are readily isolated from biological fluids such as urine (UEs). Exosomes contain proteins, micro RNA (miRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) from their cells of origin. Although miRNA, protein and lncRNA have been isolated from serum as potential biomarkers for benign and malignant disease, it is unknown if lncRNAs in UEs from urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) patients can serve as biomarkers. lncRNAs are > 200 nucleotide long transcripts that do not encode protein and play critical roles in tumor biology. As the number of recognized tumor-associated lncRNAs continues to increase, there is a parallel need to include lncRNAs into biomarker discovery and therapeutic target algorithms. The lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) has been shown to facilitate tumor initiation and progression and is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers. The importance of HOTAIR in cancer biology has sparked interest in using HOTAIR as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target. Here we show HOTAIR and several tumor-associated lncRNAs are enriched in UEs from UBC patients with high-grade muscle-invasive disease (HGMI pT2-pT4). Knockdown of HOTAIR in UBC cell lines reduces in vitro migration and invasion. Importantly, loss of HOTAIR expression in UBC cell lines alters expression of epithelial-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT) genes including SNAI1, TWIST1, ZEB1, ZO1, MMP1 LAMB3, and LAMC2. Finally, we used RNA-sequencing to identify four additional lncRNAs enriched in UBC patient UEs. These data, suggest that UE-derived lncRNA may potentially serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.	PMC4723257

Urology	2016	OBJECTIVE: To use exosomes as a vector to deliver small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) to silence the polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) gene in bladder cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from both human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) conditioned media. Fluorescently labeled exosomes were co-cultured with bladder cancer and normal epithelial cells and uptake was quantified by image cytometry. PLK-1 siRNA and negative control siRNA were loaded into HEK293 and MSC exosomes using electroporation. An invasive bladder cancer cell line (UMUC3) was co-cultured with the electroporated exosomes. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed. Protein analysis was performed by Western blot. Annexin V staining and MTT assays were used to investigate effects on apoptosis and viability. RESULTS: Bladder cancer cell lines internalize an increased percentage of HEK293 exosomes when compared to normal bladder epithelial cells. Treatment of UMUC3 cells with exosomes electroporated with PLK-1 siRNA achieved successful knockdown of PLK-1 mRNA and protein when compared to cells treated with negative control exosomes. CONCLUSION: HEK293 and MSC exosomes were effectively used as a delivery vector to transport PLK-1 siRNA to bladder cancer cells in vitro, resulting in selective gene silencing of PLK-1. The use of exosomes as a delivery vector for potential intravesical therapy is attractive.

Cardiovasc Res	2016	AIMS: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from mice with monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) induce PH in healthy mice, and the exosomes (EXO) fraction of EVs from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can blunt the development of hypoxic PH. We sought to determine whether the EXO fraction of EVs is responsible for modulating pulmonary vascular responses and whether differences in EXO-miR content explains the differential effects of EXOs from MSCs and mice with MCT-PH. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma, lung EVs from MCT-PH, and control mice were divided into EXO (exosome), microvesicle (MV) fractions and injected into healthy mice. EVs from MSCs were divided into EXO, MV fractions and injected into MCT-treated mice. PH was assessed by right ventricle-to-left ventricle + septum (RV/LV + S) ratio and pulmonary arterial wall thickness-to-diameter (WT/D) ratio. miR microarray analyses were also performed on all EXO populations. EXOs but not MVs from MCT-injured mice increased RV/LV + S, WT/D ratios in healthy mice. MSC-EXOs prevented any increase in RV/LV + S, WT/D ratios when given at the time of MCT injection and reversed the increase in these ratios when given after MCT administration. EXOs from MCT-injured mice and patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) contained increased levels of miRs-19b,-20a,-20b, and -145, whereas miRs isolated from MSC-EXOs had increased levels of anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative miRs including miRs-34a,-122,-124, and -127. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that circulating or MSC-EXOs may modulate pulmonary hypertensive effects based on their miR cargo. The ability of MSC-EXOs to reverse MCT-PH offers a promising potential target for new PAH therapies.	PMC4872877

Bone	2016	Matrix vesicles (MVs) are membrane organelles found in the extracellular matrix of calcifying cells, which contain matrix processing enzymes and regulate the extracellular environment via action of these enzymes. It is unknown whether MVs are also exosomic mediators of cell-cell communication via transfer of RNA material, and specifically, microRNA (miRNA). We investigated the presence of RNA in MVs isolated from cultures of costochondral growth zone chondrocytes. Our results showed that the average yield of MV RNA was 1.93±0.78ng RNA/10(4) cells, which was approximately 0.1% of the parent cell's total RNA. MV RNA was well-protected from RNase by the lipid membrane and was highly enriched in small RNA molecules compared to cells. Moreover, coding and non-coding small RNAs in MVs were in proportions that differed from parent cells. Enrichment of specific miRNAs was consistently observed in all three miRNA detection platforms that we used, suggesting that miRNAs are selectively packaged into MVs. MV-enriched miRNAs were related to different signaling pathways associated with bone formation. This study suggests a significant role for MVs as "matrisomes" in cell-cell communication in cartilage and bone development via transfer of specific miRNAs.	PMC4899086
27160836	Yili Wang				Exosomes-Derived MiR-302b Suppresses Lung Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration via TGFβRII Inhibition.	Cell Physiol Biochem	2016	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Several studies have reported that tumor-derived exosomes contain kinds of miRNAs, including oncogenic miRNAs and tumor suppressor miRNAs. It has been reported that miR-302b could inhibit cancer progression by targeting oncogenes post-transcriptionally. Whether miR-302b is involved in the regulation of tumor-derived exosomes on lung cancer cells proliferation has not yet been demonstrated. This study aimed to examine the effect of exosomes-derived miR-302b on lung cancer cells proliferation and explain the potential mechanism. METHODS: The effect of exosomes derived from 95C cells and 95D cells with different metastatic ability on lung cancer cell proliferation and migration were analyzed by MTT assay and Transwell assays, respectively. Exosomes of 95C and 95D cells derived miR-302b was quantified by qRT-PCR, the effect of miR-302b on proliferation and migration of 95D cells was analyzed by MTT assays and Transwell assays respectively after transfection with miR-302b, while the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2, MMP9 and TGFβRx2161; was analyzed by Western blot. The target gene of miRNA-302b was analyzed by Luciferase reporter assays. RESULTS: 95C-derived exosomes significantly decreased the migration ability of 95D cells. miRNA-302b was significantly overexpressed in 95C cells and 95C-derived exosomes compared with 95D cells and 95D-derived exosomes. Transfection of miR-302b into 95D cells significantly suppressed cells proliferation and migration capabilities along with the down-regulated expression of TGFβRII, phosphorylated ERK1/2 and MMP9 induced by TGF-β1. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes-derived miR-302b could suppress lung cancer cell proliferation and migration via the TGFβRII/ERK pathway and thus provides a potential target for human lung cancer therapy.

Stem Cell Res Ther	2016	BACKGROUND: Although patient-sourced cardiac stem cells repair damaged myocardium, the extent to which medical co-morbidities influence cardiac-derived cell products is uncertain. Therefore, we investigated the influence of atherosclerotic risk factors on the regenerative performance of human cardiac explant-derived cells (EDCs). METHODS: In this study, the Long Term Stratification for survivors of acute coronary syndromes model was used to quantify the burden of cardiovascular risk factors within a group of patients with established atherosclerosis. EDCs were cultured from human atrial appendages and injected into immunodeficient mice 7 days post-left coronary ligation. Cytokine arrays and enzyme linked immunoassays were used to determine the release of cytokines by EDCs in vitro, and echocardiography was used to determine regenerative capabilities in vivo. RESULTS: EDCs sourced from patients with more cardiovascular risk factors demonstrated a negative correlation with production of pro-healing cytokines (such as stromal cell derived factor 1α) and exosomes which had negative effects on the promotion of angiogenesis and chemotaxis. Reductions in exosomes and pro-healing cytokines with accumulating medical co-morbidities were associated with increases in production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) by EDCs. Increased patient co-morbidities were also correlated with significant attenuation in improvements of left ventricular ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: The regenerative performance of the earliest precursor cell population cultured from human explant tissue declines with accumulating medical co-morbidities. This effect is associated with diminished production of pro-cardiogenic cytokines and exosomes while IL-6 is markedly increased. Predictors of cardiac events demonstrated a lower capacity to support angiogenesis and repair injured myocardium in a mouse model of myocardial infarction.	PMC4880978

Magnetic resonance imaging of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide-labeled exosomes from stem cells: a new method to obtain labeled exosomes.	Int J Nanomedicine	2016	PURPOSE: Recent findings indicate that the beneficial effects of adipose stem cells (ASCs), reported in several neurodegenerative experimental models, could be due to their paracrine activity mediated by the release of exosomes. The aim of this study was the development and validation of an innovative exosome-labeling protocol that allows to visualize them with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: At first, ASCs were labeled using ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO, 4-6 nm), and optimal parameters to label ASCs in terms of cell viability, labeling efficiency, iron content, and magnetic resonance (MR) image contrast were investigated. Exosomes were then isolated from labeled ASCs using a standard isolation protocol. The efficiency of exosome labeling was assessed by acquiring MR images in vitro and in vivo as well as by determining their iron content. Transmission electron microscopy images and histological analysis were performed to validate the results obtained. RESULTS: By using optimized experimental parameters for ASC labeling (200 µg Fe/mL of USPIO and 72 hours of incubation), it was possible to label 100% of the cells, while their viability remained comparable to unlabeled cells; the detection limit of MR images was of 10(2) and 2.5×10(3) ASCs in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Exosomes isolated from previously labeled ASCs retain nanoparticles, as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy images. The detection limit by MRI was 3 µg and 5 µg of exosomes in vitro and in vivo, respectively. CONCLUSION: We report a new approach for labeling of exosomes by USPIO that allows detection by MRI while preserving their morphology and physiological characteristics.	PMC4898039

EBioMedicine	2016	Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes have diverse functions in regulating wound healing and inflammation; however, the molecular mechanism of human umbilical cord MSC (hUCMSC)-derived exosomes in regulating burn-induced inflammation is not well understood. We found that burn injury significantly increased the inflammatory reaction of rats or macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), increased tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels and decreased IL-10 levels. hUCMSC-exosome administration successfully reversed this reaction. Further studies showed that miR-181c in the exosomes played a pivotal role in regulating inflammation. Compared to control hUCMSC-exosomes, hUCMSC-exosomes overexpressing miR-181c more effectively suppressed the TLR4 signaling pathway and alleviated inflammation in burned rats. Administration of miR-181c-expressing hUCMSC-exosomes or TLR4 knockdown significantly reduced LPS-induced TLR4 expression by macrophages and the inflammatory reaction. In summary, miR-181c expression in hUCMSC-exosomes reduces burn-induced inflammation by downregulating the TLR4 signaling pathway.	PMC4919539

Stem Cells Transl Med	2016	: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a significant global public health problem, causing more than 350,000 deaths every year. Although the development of direct-acting antivirals has improved the sustained virological response rate in HCV patients, novel anti-HCV agents with higher efficacy as well as better tolerance and cheaper production costs are still urgently needed. Cell-based therapy, especially its unique and strong paracrine ability to transfer information to other cells via extracellular vesicles such as exosomes, has become one of the most popular therapeutic methods in recent years. In our study, exosomes secreted from umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (uMSCs), which are widely used in regenerative medicine, inhibited HCV infection in vitro, especially viral replication, with low cell toxicity. Our analysis revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) from uMSC-derived exosomes (uMSC-Exo) had their unique expression profiles, and these functional miRNAs, mainly represented by let-7f, miR-145, miR-199a, and miR-221 released from uMSC-Exo, largely contributed to the suppression of HCV RNA replication. These four miRNAs possessed binding sites in HCV RNA as demonstrated by the target prediction algorithm. In addition, uMSC-Exo therapy showed synergistic effect when combined with U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved interferon-α or telaprevir, enhancing their anti-HCV ability and thus improving the clinical significance of these regenerative substances for future application as optimal adjuvants of anti-HCV therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: This work reported, for the first time, the identification of stem cell-derived exosomes of antiviral activity. Umbilical mesenchymal stem cell-secreted exosomes inhibited hepatitis C virus infection through transporting a mixture of microRNAs complementing the viral genomes to the host cells. This finding provides insights and prospects for physiologically secreted substances for antiviral therapy.	PMC4996444

Next-Generation Sequencing of Protein-Coding and Long Non-protein-Coding RNAs in Two Types of Exosomes Derived from Human Whole Saliva.	Biol Pharm Bull	2016	Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles containing microRNAs and mRNAs that are produced by various types of cells. We previously used ultrafiltration and size-exclusion chromatography to isolate two types of human salivary exosomes (exosomes I, II) that are different in size and proteomes. We showed that salivary exosomes contain large repertoires of small RNAs. However, precise information regarding long RNAs in salivary exosomes has not been fully determined. In this study, we investigated the compositions of protein-coding RNAs (pcRNAs) and long non-protein-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) of exosome I, exosome II and whole saliva (WS) by next-generation sequencing technology. Although 11% of all RNAs were commonly detected among the three samples, the compositions of reads mapping to known RNAs were similar. The most abundant pcRNA is ribosomal RNA protein, and pcRNAs of some salivary proteins such as S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (protein S100-A8) were present in salivary exosomes. Interestingly, lncRNAs of pseudogenes (presumably, processed pseudogenes) were abundant in exosome I, exosome II and WS. Translationally controlled tumor protein gene, which plays an important role in cell proliferation, cell death and immune responses, was highly expressed as pcRNA and pseudogenes in salivary exosomes. Our results show that salivary exosomes contain various types of RNAs such as pseudogenes and small RNAs, and may mediate intercellular communication by transferring these RNAs to target cells as gene expression regulators.

Colorectal cancer cell-derived microRNA200 modulates the resistance of adjacent blood endothelial barriers in vitro.	Oncol Rep	2016	Since cancer cells, when grown as spheroids, display drug sensitivity and radiation resistance patterns such as seen in vivo we recently established a three‑dimensional (3D) in vitro model recapitulating colorectal cancer (CRC)-triggered lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)‑barrier breaching to study mechanisms of intra‑/extravasation. CRC metastasizes not only through lymphatics but also through blood vessels and here we extend the 3D model to the interaction of blood endothelial cells (BECs) with naïve and 5‑fluorouracil (5‑FU)‑resistant CRC CCL227 cells. The 3D model enabled quantifying effects of tumour‑derived microRNA200 (miR200) miR200a, miR200b, miR200c, miR141 and miR429 regarding the induction of so-called 'circular chemorepellent‑induced defects' (CCIDs) within the BEC‑barrier, which resemble gates for tumour transmigration. For this, miR200 precursors were individually transfected and furthermore, the modulation of ZEB family expression was analysed by western blotting. miR200c, miR141 and miR429, which are contained in exosomes from naïve CCL227 cells, downregulated the expression of ZEB2, SNAI and TWIST in BECs. The exosomes of 5‑FU‑resistant CCL227‑RH cells, which are devoid of miR200, accelerated CCID formation in BEC monolayers as compared to exosomes from naïve CCL227 cells. This confirmed the reported role of ZEB2 and SNAI in CRC metastasis and highlighted the active contribution of the stroma in the metastatic process. CCL227 spheroids affected the integrity of BEC and LEC barriers alike, which was in agreement with the observation that CRC metastasizes via blood stream (into the liver) as well as via lymphatics (into lymph nodes and lungs). This further validated the CRC/LEC and CRC/BEC in vitro model to study mechanisms of CRC spreading through vascular systems. Treatment of CCL227‑RH cells with the HDAC inhibitors mocetinostat and sulforaphane reduced CCID formation to the level triggered by naïve CCL227 spheroids, however, without significantly influencing miR200 expression in CCL227-RH cells.

Retrovirology	2016	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are membrane nano-vesicles secreted by a multitude of cells that harbor biological constituents such as proteins, lipids, mRNA and microRNA. Exosomes can potentially transfer their cargo to other cells, implicating them in many patho-physiological processes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), residents of the bone marrow and metastatic niches, potentially interact with cancer cells and/or their derived exosomes. In this study, we investigated whether exosomes derived from adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells act as intercellular messengers delivering leukemia-related genes that modulate the properties of human MSCs in favor of leukemia. We hypothesized that the cargo of ATL-derived exosomes is transferred to MSCs and alter their functional behavior to support the establishment of the appropriate microenvironment for leukemia. RESULTS: We showed that both ATL cells (C81 and HuT-102) and patient-derived cells released Tax-containing exosomes. The cargo of HuT-102-derived exosomes consisted of miR-21, miR-155 and vascular endothelial growth factor. We demonstrated that HuT-102-derived exosomes not only deliver Tax to recipient MSCs, but also induce NF-κB activation leading to a change in cellular morphology, increase in proliferation and the induction of gene expression of migration and angiogenic markers. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ATL-derived exosomes deliver Tax and other leukemia-related genes to MSCs and alter their properties to presumably create a more conducive milieu for leukemia. These findings highlight the contribution of leukemia-derived exosomes in cellular transformation and their potential value as biomarkers and targets in therapeutic strategies.	PMC5070229
27872197	Mathilakath M Vijayan	Department of BiologyUniversity of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada .	matt.vijayan@ucalgary.ca		Plasma exosomes are enriched in Hsp70 and modulated by stress and cortisol in rainbow trout.	J Endocrinol	2017	Exosomes are endosomally derived vesicles that are secreted from cells and contain a suite of molecules, including proteins and nucleic acids. Recent studies suggest the possibility that exosomes in circulation may be affecting recipient target cell function, but the modes of action are unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that exosomes are in circulation in fish plasma and that these vesicles are enriched with heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). Exosomes were isolated from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) plasma using differential centrifugation, and their presence was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and the exosomal marker acetylcholinesterase. Plasma exosomes were enriched with Hsp70, and this stress protein was transiently elevated in trout plasma in response to a heat shock in vivo Using trout hepatocytes in primary culture, we tested whether stress levels of cortisol, the principle corticosteroid in teleosts, regulates exosomal Hsp70 content. As expected, a 1-h heat shock (+15°C above ambient) increased Hsp70 expression in hepatocytes, and this led to higher Hsp70 enrichment in exosomes over a 24-h period. However, cortisol treatment significantly reduced the expression of Hsp70 in exosomes released from either unstressed or heat-shocked hepatocytes. This cortisol-mediated suppression was not specific to Hsp70 as beta-actin expression was also reduced in exosomes released from hepatocytes treated with the steroid. Our results suggest that circulating Hsp70 is released from target tissues via exosomes, and their release is modulated by stress and cortisol. Overall, we propose a novel role for extracellular vesicular transport of Hsp70 in the organismal stress response.

Methods Mol Biol	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are composed of microvesicles and exosomes. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (40-120 nm sized) of endosomal origin released in the extracellular medium from cells when multivesicular bodies fuse with the plasma membrane, whereas microvesicles (i.e., shedding vesicles, 100 nm to 1 μm sized) bud from the plasma membrane. Exosomes and microvesicles carry functional proteins and nucleic acids (especially mRNAs and microRNAs) that can be transferred to surrounding cells and tissues and can impact multiple dimensions of the cellular life. Most of the cells, if not all, from neuronal to immune cells, release exosomes and microvesicles in the extracellular medium, and all biological fluids including blood (serum/plasma), urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva contain EVs.Prion-infected cultured cells are known to secrete infectivity into their environment. We characterized this cell-free form of prions and showed that infectivity was associated with exosomes. Since exosomes are produced by a variety of cells, including cells that actively accumulate prions, they could be a vehicle for infectivity in body fluids and could participate to the dissemination of prions in the organism. In addition, such infectious exosomes also represent a natural, simple, biological material to get key information on the abnormal PrP forms associated with infectivity.In this chapter, we describe first a method that allows exosomes and microvesicles isolation from prion-infected cell cultures and in a second time the strategies to characterize the prions containing exosomes and their ability to disseminate the prion agent.

High Levels of EBV-Encoded RNA 1 (EBER1) Trigger Interferon and Inflammation-Related Genes in Keratinocytes Expressing HPV16 E6/E7.	PLoS One	2017	Different types of cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can release exosomes containing viral components that functionally affect neighboring cells. Previously, we found that EBV was localized mostly in infiltrating lymphocytes within the stromal layer of cervical lesions. In this study, we aimed to determine effects of exosome-transferred EBV-encoded RNAs (EBERs) on keratinocytes expressing human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E6/E7 (DonorI-HPV16 HFKs). Lipid transfection of in vitro-transcribed EBER1 molecules (ivt EBER1) into DonorI-HPV16 HFKs caused strong induction of interferon (IFN)-related genes and interleukin 6 (IL-6). To gain insights into the physiological situation, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), low passage DonorI-HPV16 HFKs and primary keratinocytes were used as recipient cells for internalization of exosomes from wild-type EBV (wt EBV) or B95-8 EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression of EBER1, HPV16 E6/E7, IFN-related genes and IL-6 in recipient cells. The secretion of inflammatory cytokines was investigated using cytometric bead array. Wt EBV-modified exosomes induced both IFN-related genes and IL-6 upon uptake into moDCs, while exosomes from B95-8 EBV LCLs induced only IL-6 in moDCs. Internalization of EBV-modified exosomes was demonstrated in DonorI-HPV16 HFKs, yielding only EBER1 but not EBER2. However, EBER1 transferred by exosomes did not induce IFN-related genes or IL-6 expression and inflammatory cytokine secretion in DonorI-HPV16 HFKs and primary keratinocytes. EBER1 copy numbers in exosomes from wt EBV-infected LCLs were 10-fold higher than in exosomes from B95-8 LCLs (equal cell equivalent), whereas ivt EBER1 was used at approximately 100-fold higher concentration than in exosomes. These results demonstrated that the induction of IFN-related genes and IL-6 by EBER1 depends on quantity of EBER1 and type of recipient cells. High levels of EBER1 in cervical cells or infiltrating dendritic cells may play a role in the inflammation-to-oncogenesis transition of HPV-associated cervical cancer through modulation of innate immune signals.

Stem Cell Res Ther	2017	BACKGROUND: Human menstrual blood-derived stem cells (MenSCs) are a novel source of MSCs that provide the advantage of being easy to collect and isolate. Exosomes contain some mRNAs and adhesion molecules that can potentially impact cellular and animal physiology. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of MenSC-derived exosomes (MenSC-Ex) on AML12 cells (in vitro) and D-GalN/LPS-induced FHF mice (in vivo). METHODS: Transmission electron microscopy and Western blot were used to identify MenSC-Ex. Antibody array was used to examine cytokine levels on MenSC-Ex. MenSC-Ex were treated in D-GalN/LPS-induced AML12 in vitro. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured. MenSC-Ex were injected into the tail veins of mice 24 h before treatment with D-GalN/LPS. Blood and liver tissues served as physiological and biochemical indexes. The number of liver mononuclear cells (MNCs) and the amount of the active apoptotic protein caspase-3 were determined to elaborate the mechanism of hepatoprotective activity. RESULTS: Human menstrual blood-derived stem cell-derived exosomes (MenSC-Ex) are bi-lipid membrane vesicles that have a round, ball-like shape with a diameter of approximately 30-100 nm. Cytokine arrays have shown that MenSC-Ex expressed cytokines, including ICAM-1, angiopoietin-2, Axl, angiogenin, IGFBP-6, osteoprotegerin, IL-6, and IL-8. MenSC-Ex markedly improved liver function, enhanced survival rates, and inhibited liver cell apoptosis at 6 h after transplantation. MenSC-Ex migrated to sites of injury and to AML12 cells (a mouse hepatocyte cell line), respectively. Moreover, MenSC-Ex reduced the number of liver mononuclear cells (MNCs) and the amount of the active apoptotic protein caspase-3 in injured livers. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results provide preliminary evidence for the anti-apoptotic capacity of MenSC-Ex in FHF and suggest that MenSC-Ex may be an alternative therapeutic approach to treat FHF.

Exosomal MicroRNA-15a Transfer from the Pancreas Augments Diabetic Complications by Inducing Oxidative Stress.	Antioxid Redox Signal	2017	AIMS: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), one type of noncoding RNA, modulate post-transcriptional gene expression in various pathogenic pathways in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Currently, little is known about how miRNAs influence disease pathogenesis by targeting cells at a distance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of exosomal miRNAs during T2D. RESULTS: We show that miR-15a is increased in the plasma of diabetic patients, correlating with disease severity. miR-15 plays an important role in insulin production in pancreatic β-cells. By culturing rat pancreatic β-cells (INS-1) cells in high-glucose media, we identified a source of increased miR-15a in the blood as exosomes secreted by pancreatic β-cells. We postulate that miR-15a, produced in pancreatic β-cells, can enter the bloodstream and contribute to retinal injury. miR-15a overexpression in Müller cells can be induced by exposing Müller cells to exosomes derived from INS-1 cells under high-glucose conditions and results in oxidative stress by targeting Akt3, which leads to apoptotic cell death. The in vivo relevance of these findings is supported by results from high-fat diet and pancreatic β-cell-specific miR-15a-/- mice. INNOVATION: This study highlights an important and underappreciated mechanism of remote cell-cell communication (exosomal transfer of miRNA) and its influence on the development of T2D complications. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that circulating miR-15a contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes and supports the concept that miRNAs released by one cell type can travel through the circulation and play a role in disease progression via their transfer to different cell types, inducing oxidative stress and cell injury.

Exosomes are released by bystander cells exposed to radiation-induced biophoton signals: Reconciling the mechanisms mediating the bystander effect.	PLoS One	2017	OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to explore a possible molecular mechanism by which ultraviolet (UV) biophotons could elicit bystander responses in reporter cells and resolve the problem of seemingly mutually exclusive mechanisms of a physical UV signal & a soluble factor-mediated bystander signal. METHODS: The human colon carcinoma cell line, HCT116 p53 +/+, was directly irradiated with 0.5 Gy tritium beta particles to induce ultraviolet biophoton emission. Bystander cells were not directly irradiated but were exposed to the emitted UV biophotons. Medium was subsequently harvested from UV-exposed bystander cells. The exosomes extracted from this medium were incubated with reporter cell populations. These reporter cells were then assayed for clonogenic survival and mitochondrial membrane potential with and without prior treatment of the exosomes with RNase. RESULTS: Clonogenic cell survival was significantly reduced in reporter cells incubated with exosomes extracted from cells exposed to secondarily-emitted UV. These exosomes also induced significant mitochondrial membrane depolarization in receiving reporter cells. Conversely, exosomes extracted from non-UV-exposed cells did not produce bystander effects in reporter cells. The treatment of exosomes with RNase prior to their incubation with reporter cells effectively abolished bystander effects in reporter cells and this suggests a role for RNA in mediating the bystander response elicited by UV biophotons and their produced exosomes. CONCLUSION: This study supports a role for exosomes released from UV biophoton-exposed bystander cells in eliciting bystander responses and also indicates a reconciliation between the UV-mediated bystander effect and the bystander effect which has been suggested in the literature to be mediated by soluble factors.

Oxygen tension regulates the miRNA profile and bioactivity of exosomes released from extravillous trophoblast cells - Liquid biopsies for monitoring complications of pregnancy.	PLoS One	2017	Our understanding of how cells communicate has undergone a paradigm shift since the recent recognition of the role of exosomes in intercellular signaling. In this study, we investigated whether oxygen tension alters the exosome release and miRNA profile from extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells, modifying their bioactivity on endothelial cells (EC). Furthermore, we have established the exosomal miRNA profile at early gestation in women who develop pre-eclampsia (PE) and spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). HTR-8/SVneo cells were used as an EVT model. The effect of oxygen tension (i.e. 8% and 1% oxygen) on exosome release was quantified using nanocrystals (Qdot®) coupled to CD63 by fluorescence NTA. A real-time, live-cell imaging system (Incucyte™) was used to establish the effect of exosomes on EC. Plasma samples were obtained at early gestation (<18 weeks) and classified according to pregnancy outcomes. An Illumina TrueSeq Small RNA kit was used to construct a small RNA library from exosomal RNA obtained from EVT and plasma samples. The number of exosomes was significantly higher in EVT cultured under 1% compared to 8% oxygen. In total, 741 miRNA were identified in exosomes from EVT. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these miRNA were associated with cell migration and cytokine production. Interestingly, exosomes isolated from EVT cultured at 8% oxygen increased EC migration, whilst exosomes cultured at 1% oxygen decreased EC migration. These changes were inversely proportional to TNF-α released from EC. Finally, we have identified a set of unique miRNAs in exosomes from EVT cultured at 1% oxygen and exosomes isolated from the circulation of mothers at early gestation, who later developed PE and SPTB. We suggest that aberrant exosomal signalling by placental cells is a common aetiological factor in pregnancy complications characterised by incomplete SpA remodeling and is therefore a clinically relevant biomarker of pregnancy complications.

Pflugers Arch	2017	Preeclampsia is characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, suppression of plasma renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, and impaired urine sodium excretion. Aberrantly filtered plasmin in urine may activate proteolytically the γ-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and promote Na+ reabsorption and urine K+ loss. Plasma and urine was sampled from patients with preeclampsia, healthy pregnant controls and non-pregnant women, and from patients with nephrostomy catheters. Aldosterone concentration, urine plasminogen, and protein were determined. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Immunoblotting was used to detect exosome markers; γ-ENaC (two different epitopes within the inhibitory peptide tract), α-ENaC, and renal outer medullary K-channel (ROMK) and compared with human kidney cortex homogenate. Urine total plasmin(ogen) was significantly increased in preeclampsia, plasma and urine aldosterone was higher in pregnancy compared to non-pregnancy, and the urine Na/K ratio was lower in preeclampsia compared to healthy pregnancy. Exosome markers ALIX and AQP-2 were stably associated with exosomes across groups. Exosomal α-ENaC-subunit migrated at 75 kDa and dominantly at 50 kDa and was significantly elevated in pregnancy. In human kidney cortex tissue and two of four pelvis catheter urine, ~90-100 kDa full-length γ-ENaC was detected while no full-length γ-ENaC but 75, 60, and 37 kDa variants dominated in voided urine exosomes. There was no difference in γ-ENaC protein abundances between healthy pregnancy and preeclampsia. ROMK was detected inconsistently in urine exosomes. Pregnancy and preeclampsia were associated with increased abundance of furin-cleaved α-ENaC subunit while γ-subunit appeared predominantly in cleaved form independently of conditions and with a significant contribution from post-renal cleavage.

Renal Regenerative Potential of Different Extracellular Vesicle Populations Derived from Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells.	Tissue Eng Part A	2017	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) promote the regeneration of kidneys in different animal models of acute kidney injury (AKI) in a manner comparable with the cells of origin. However, due to the heterogeneity observed in the EVs isolated from MSCs, it is unclear which population is responsible for the proregenerative effects. We therefore evaluated the effect of various EV populations separated by differential ultracentrifugation (10K population enriched with microvesicles and 100K population enriched with exosomes) on AKI recovery. Only the exosomal-enriched population induced an improvement of renal function and morphology comparable with that of the total EV population. Interestingly, the 100K EVs exerted a proproliferative effect on murine tubular epithelial cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the molecular content from the different EV populations revealed a distinct profile. The 100K population, for instance, was enriched in specific mRNAs (CCNB1, CDK8, CDC6) reported to influence cell cycle entry and progression; miRNAs involved in regulating proliferative/antiapoptotic pathways and growth factors (hepatocyte growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1) that could explain the effect of renal tubular cell proliferation. On the other hand, the EV population enriched in microvesicles (10K) was unable to induce renal regeneration and had a molecular profile with lower expression of proproliferative molecules. In conclusion, the different molecular composition of exosome- and microvesicle-enriched populations may explain the regenerative effect of EVs observed in AKI.	PMC5689130

MiR-122 modification enhances the therapeutic efficacy of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells against liver fibrosis.	J Cell Mol Med	2017	Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation alone may be insufficient for treatment of liver fibrosis because of complicated histopathological changes in the liver. Given that miR-122 plays an essential role in liver fibrosis by negatively regulating the proliferation and transactivation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), this study investigated whether miR-122 modification can improve the therapeutic efficacy of adipose tissue-derived MSCs in treating liver fibrosis. MiR-122-modified AMSCs (AMSC-122) were constructed through lentivirus-mediated transfer of pre-miR-122. MiR-122-modified AMSCs expressed high level of miR-122, while they retained their phenotype and differentiation potential as naïve AMSCs. AMSC-122 more effectively suppressed the proliferation of and collagen maturation in HSCs than scramble miRNA-modified AMSCs. In addition, AMSC-derived exosomes mediated the miR-122 communication between AMSCs and HSCs, further affecting the expression levels of miR-122 target genes, such as insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R), Cyclin G(1) (CCNG1) and prolyl-4-hydroxylase α1 (P4HA1), which are involved in proliferation of and collagen maturation in HSCs. Moreover, miR-122 modification enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of AMSCs in the treatment of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 )-induced liver fibrosis by suppressing the activation of HSCs and alleviating collagen deposition. Results demonstrate that miR-122 modification improves the therapeutic efficacy of AMSCs through exosome-mediated miR-122 communication; thus, miR-122 modification is a new potential strategy for treatment of liver fibrosis.

NK Cell-derived Exosomes From NK Cells Previously Exposed to Neuroblastoma Cells Augment the Antitumor Activity of Cytokine-activated NK Cells.	J Immunother	2017	Immune cell-derived exosomes can increase immunity against tumors. In contrast, tumor-derived exosomes can reduce the immunity and can change the tumor microenvironment to further develop and provide metastasis. These effects take place by an alteration in the innate and adaptive immune cell functions. In this experiment, we studied the natural killer (NK) cells' effectiveness on tumor cells after expansion and thereafter incubated it with exosomes. The exosomes were derived from 2 populations of NK cells: (1) naive NK cells and, (2) NK cells previously exposed to neuroblastoma (NB) cells. Moreover, we have studied the NB-derived exosomes on NK cell function. The molecular load of the characterized exosomes (by means of nanoparticle-tracking analysis, flow cytometry, scanning electron microscopy, and western blot) from NK cells exposed to the NB cell revealed their expression of natural killer cell receptors in addition to CD56, NKG2D, and KIR2DL2 receptors. These exosomes were used to treat NK cells and thereafter administered to NB tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed some kind of NK cells' education by the exosomes. This education from NK cells previously exposed to NB cell-derived exosomes caused efficient and greater cytotoxicity against NB tumors, but NB-derived exosomes act as tumor promoters by providing a tumor supporting niche. Hence, this method of preparing the exosomes has a dramatic effect on activation of anti-NK cells against NB cells.

Accelerated growth of B16BL6 tumor in mice through efficient uptake of their own exosomes by B16BL6 cells.	Cancer Sci	2017	Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released by various cell types and play roles in cell-cell communication. Several studies indicate that cancer cell-derived exosomes play important pathophysiological roles in tumor progression. Biodistribution of cancer cell-derived exosomes in tumor tissue is an important factor for determining their role in tumor proliferation; however, limited studies have assessed the biodistribution of exosomes in tumor tissues. In the present study, we examined the effect of cancer-cell derived exosomes on tumor growth by analyzing their biodistribution. Murine melanoma B16BL6-derived exosomes increased the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of B16BL6 cells, which was associated with an increase and decrease in the levels of proliferation- and apoptosis-related proteins, respectively. GW4869-induced inhibition of exosome secretion decreased the proliferation of B16BL6 cells, and treatment of GW4869-treated cells with B16BL6-derived exosomes restored their proliferation. Next, we treated B16BL6 tumors in mice with B16BL6-derived exosomes and examined the biodistribution and cellular uptake of these exosomes. After the intratumoral injection of radiolabeled B16BL6-derived exosomes, most radioactivity was detected within the tumor tissues of mice. Fractionation of cells present in the tumor tissue showed that fluorescently labeled exosomes were mainly taken up by B16BL6 cells. Moreover, intratumoral injection of B16BL6-derived exosomes promoted tumor growth, whereas intratumoral injection of GW4869 suppressed tumor growth. These results indicate that B16BL6 cells secrete and take up their own exosomes to induce their proliferation and inhibit their apoptosis, which promotes tumor progression.	PMC5581513

Inhibition of microRNA-214 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition process and induces interstitial cystitis in postmenopausal women by upregulating Mfn2.	Exp Mol Med	2017	Our study aims to investigate the roles that microRNA-214 (miR-214) plays in the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and the development of interstitial cystitis (IC) in postmenopausal women by targeting Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2). IC bladder tissues and adjacent normal bladder tissues were collected from postmenopausal women. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was conducted. The target relationship between miR-214 and Mfn2 was determined by a dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) were extracted from postmenopausal rats and assigned to the blank, mimics, miR-214 inhibitors, mimics negative control (NC), inhibitors NC, Mfn2 siRNA, miR-214 inhibitors and Mfn2 siRNA groups. Exosomes secreted by transfected ADMSCs were instilled into the bladders of postmenopausal rats. The expression of miR-214 and Mfn2 mRNA and EMT markers was assessed by qRT-PCR and western blotting. It was confirmed that Mfn2 was the target gene of miR-214 in IC. Compared with the normal bladder tissues, miR-214 decreased, but Mfn2 increased in IC bladder tissues. Compared with the blank group, the expression of miR-214 and the expression levels of N-cadherin, Fibronectin, Twist1, Snail and Vimentin mRNA and protein increased, whereas the expression levels of Mfn2, E-cadherin and ZO-1 mRNA and protein decreased in the miR-214 mimics and Mfn2 groups. The expression of MiR-214 and the expression levels of N-cadherin, Fibronectin, Twist1, Snail and Vimentin mRNA and protein decreased, whereas the expression levels of Mfn2, E-cadherin and ZO-1 mRNA and protein increased in the miR-214 inhibitors group. Our findings indicate that the inhibition of miR-214 promotes the EMT process and contributes to bladder wall fibrosis by up-regulating Mfn2, thus leading to the occurrence of IC in postmenopausal women.

Glioblastoma stem-like cells secrete the pro-angiogenic VEGF-A factor in extracellular vesicles.	J Extracell Vesicles	2017	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are mortifying brain tumours that contain a subpopulation of tumour cells with stem-like properties, termed glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs). GSCs largely contribute to tumour initiation, propagation and resistance to current anti-cancer therapies. GSCs are situated in perivascular niches, closely associated with brain microvascular endothelial cells, thereby involved in bidirectional molecular and cellular interactions. Moreover, extracellular vesicles are suspected to carry essential information that can adapt the microenvironment to the tumour's needs, including tumour-induced angiogenesis. In GBM, extracellular vesicles produced by differentiated tumour cells and GSCs were demonstrated to disseminate locally and at distance. Here, we report that the pro-angiogenic pro-permeability factor VEGF-A is carried in extracellular vesicles secreted from ex vivo cultured patient-derived GSCs. Of note, extracellular vesicle-derived VEGF-A contributes to the in vitro elevation of permeability and angiogenic potential in human brain endothelial cells. Indeed, VEGF-A silencing in GSCs compromised in vitro extracellular vesicle-mediated increase in permeability and angiogenesis. From a clinical standpoint, extracellular vesicles isolated from circulating blood of GBM patients present higher levels of VEGF-A, as compared to healthy donors. Overall, our results suggest that extracellular vesicle-harboured VEGF-A targets brain endothelial cells and might impact their ability to form new vessels. Thus, tumour-released EV cargo might emerge as an instrumental part of the tumour-induced angiogenesis and vascular permeability modus operandi in GBM.	PMC5549846

Exosomes Derived from Mesenchymal Stem Cells Rescue Myocardial Ischaemia/Reperfusion Injury by Inducing Cardiomyocyte Autophagy Via AMPK and Akt Pathways.	Cell Physiol Biochem	2017	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Reperfusion after an ischaemic insult might cause infarct extension. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes could attenuate myocardial remodelling in animal models of myocardial ischaemia reperfusion injury (MIRI), and the present study aimed to explore the related mechanisms. METHODS: In vitro, rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes (H9C2s) were exposed to H2O2. Cell viability was detected by the CCK-8 assay, apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-PE/7-AAD staining, ROS production was detected by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, and apoptosis-related proteins and signalling pathway-related proteins were detected by western blot analysis. Autophagic flux was measured using the tandem fluorescent mRFG-GFP-LC3 assay. MSC-derived exosomes were extracted using the total exosome isolation reagent. Apoptosis, myocardial infarction size, heart function and myocardial LC3B expression were examined in an in vivo I/R model by the TUNEL assay, TTC/Evan blue staining, echocardiography and immunohistochemicalstaining, respectively. RESULTS: In vitro, H2O2 dose-dependently increased ROS production and cell apoptosis in H9C2s and blocked autophagic flux after 3 h of exposure; autophagy gradually decreased thereafter, and the lowest level was detected at 12 h after exposure. MSC-derived exosomes reduced H2O2-induced ROS production and cell apoptosis and enhanced autophagy at 12 h after exposure. In H9C2 cells exposed to H2O2 for 12 h, treatment with exosomes enhanced autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR and Akt/mTOR pathways. Likewise, in vivo exosome injections in rats that underwent I/R injury significantly reduced apoptosis and the myocardial infarct size and upregulated myocardial LC3B expression as well as improved heart function. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that MSC-derived exosomes could reduce MIRI by inducing cardiomyocyte autophagy via AMPK/mTOR and Akt/mTOR pathways.

J Neurosci	2017	In the brain, astrocytes secrete diverse substances that regulate neuronal function and viability. Exosomes, which are vesicles produced through the formation of multivesicular bodies and their subsequent fusion with the plasma membrane, are also released from astrocytes via exocytotic secretion. Astrocytic exosomes carry heat shock proteins that can reduce the cellular toxicity of misfolded proteins and prevent neurodegeneration. Although mutant huntingtin (mHtt) affects multiple functions of astrocytes, it remains unknown whether mHtt impairs the production of exosomes from astrocytes. We found that mHtt is not present in astrocytic exosomes, but can decrease exosome secretion from astrocytes in HD140Q knock-in (KI) mice. N-terminal mHtt accumulates in the nuclei and forms aggregates, causing decreased secretion of exosomes from cultured astrocytes. Consistently, there is a significant decrease in secreted exosomes in both female and male HD KI mouse striatum in which abundant nuclear mHtt aggregates are present. Conversely, injection of astrocytic exosomes into the striatum of HD140Q KI mice reduces the density of mHtt aggregates. Further, mHtt in astrocytes decreased the expression of αB-crystallin, a small heat shock protein that is enriched in astrocytes and mediates exosome secretion, by reducing the association of Sp1 with the enhancer of the αB-crystallin gene. Importantly, overexpression of αB-crystallin rescues defective exosome release from HD astrocytes as well as mHtt aggregates in the striatum of HD140Q KI mice. Our results demonstrate that mHtt reduces the expression of αB-crystallin in astrocytes to decrease exosome secretion in the HD brains, contributing to non-cell-autonomous neurotoxicity in HD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by selective neurodegeneration that preferentially occurs in the striatal medium spiny neurons. Recent studies in different HD mouse models demonstrated that dysfunction of astrocytes, a major type of glial cell, leads to neuronal vulnerability. Emerging evidence shows that exosomes secreted from astrocytes contain neuroprotective cargoes that could support the survival of neighboring neurons. We found that mHtt in astrocytes impairs exosome secretion by decreasing αB-crystallin, a protein that is expressed mainly in glial cells and mediates exosome secretion. Overexpression of αB-crystallin could alleviate the deficient exosome release and neuropathology in HD mice. Our results revealed a new pathological pathway that affects the critical support of glial cells to neurons in the HD brain.	PMC5618269

Electronic address: .	jolefsky@ucsd.edu		Adipose Tissue Macrophage-Derived Exosomal miRNAs Can Modulate In Vivo and In Vitro Insulin Sensitivity.	Cell	2017	MiRNAs are regulatory molecules that can be packaged into exosomes and secreted from cells. Here, we show that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) in obese mice secrete miRNA-containing exosomes (Exos), which cause glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when administered to lean mice. Conversely, ATM Exos obtained from lean mice improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity when administered to obese recipients. miR-155 is one of the miRNAs overexpressed in obese ATM Exos, and earlier studies have shown that PPARγ is a miR-155 target. Our results show that miR-155KO animals are insulin sensitive and glucose tolerant compared to controls. Furthermore, transplantation of WT bone marrow into miR-155KO mice mitigated this phenotype. Taken together, these studies show that ATMs secrete exosomes containing miRNA cargo. These miRNAs can be transferred to insulin target cell types through mechanisms of paracrine or endocrine regulation with robust effects on cellular insulin action, in vivo insulin sensitivity, and overall glucose homeostasis.

Toxicol Sci	2018	Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (IDILI) is thought to often result from an adaptive immune attack on the liver. However, it has been proposed that the cascade of events culminating in an adaptive immune response begins with drug-induced hepatocyte stress, release of exosomal danger signals, and innate immune activation, all of which may occur in the absence of significant hepatocelluar death. A micropatterned coculture model (HepatoPac) was used to explore the possibility that changes in exosome content precede overt necrosis in response to the IDILI drug tolvaptan. Hepatocytes from 3 human donors were exposed to a range of tolvaptan concentrations bracketing plasma Cmax or DMSO control continuously for 4, 24, or 72 h. Although alanine aminotransferase release was not significantly affected at any concentration, tolvaptan exposures at approximately 30-fold median plasma Cmax resulted in increased release of exosomal microRNA-122 (miR-122) into the medium. Cellular imaging and microarray analysis revealed that the most significant increases in exosomal miR-122 were associated with programmed cell death and small increases in membrane permeability. However, early increases in exosome miR-122 were more associated with mitochondrial-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. Taken together, these data suggest that tolvaptan treatment induces cellular stress and exosome release of miR-122 in primary human hepatocytes in the absence of overt necrosis, providing direct demonstration of this with a drug capable of causing IDILI. In susceptible individuals, these early events may occur at pharmacologic concentrations of tolvaptan and may promote an adaptive immune attack that ultimately results in clinically significant liver injury.

Histological Evaluation of Experimentally Induced Critical Size Defect Skin Wounds Using Exosomal Solution of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived Microvesicles.	Int J Stem Cells	2017	Background and Objectives: The present study investigated whether MSCs derived microvesicles (MVs) or (Exosomes) can exert therapeutic effects on an experimental model of cutaneous injury and explored the underlying involving mechanisms. Methods and Results: Three bilateral full thickness circular wounds were created on the back of two groups of dogs using 2-cm dermal punch. The wounds were at least 2.5 cm apart. Saline was subcutaneously injected in 4 places around each wound area in group-I (control), whereas an equal volume of exosomal solution of MSCs derived MVs was similarly injected in group-II. The findings demonstrated that MSCs derived MVs had significantly promoted cutaneous wound healing, collagen synthesis, and vascularization at wound sites. The application of the exosomal solution had not only promoted the generation of newly formed vessels, but also have accelerated their development and maturation leading to a faster healing process. Conclusions: MSC-Exosomes appeared to be a superior candidate for treating cutaneous wounds than their originator cells, and may represent a promising opportunity to develop a novel cell-free therapy approach that might overcome the obstacles and risks associated with the use of native or engineered stem cells transplantation therapy.

Myocardial reparative functions of exosomes from mesenchymal stem cells are enhanced by hypoxia treatment of the cells via transferring microRNA-210 in an nSMase2-dependent way.	Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol	2017	Hypoxia treatment enhances paracrine effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The aim of this study was to investigate whether exosomes from hypoxia-treated MSCs (ExoH) are superior to those from normoxia-treated MSCs (ExoN) for myocardial repair. Mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs were cultured under hypoxia or normoxia for 24 h, and exosomes from conditioned media were intramyocardially injected into infarcted heart of C57BL/6 mouse. ExoH resulted in significantly higher survival, smaller scar size and better cardiac functions recovery. ExoH conferred increased vascular density, lower cardiomyocytes (CMs) apoptosis, reduced fibrosis and increased recruitment of cardiac progenitor cells in the infarcted heart relative to ExoN. MicroRNA analysis revealed significantly higher levels of microRNA-210 (miR-210) in ExoH compared with ExoN. Transfection of a miR-210 mimic into endothelial cells (ECs) and CMs conferred similar biological effects as ExoH. Hypoxia treatment of MSCs increased the expression of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) which is crucial for exosome secretion. Blocking the activity of nSMase2 resulted in reduced miR-210 secretion and abrogated the beneficial effects of ExoH. In conclusion, hypoxic culture augments miR-210 and nSMase2 activities in MSCs and their secreted exosomes, and this is responsible at least in part for the enhanced cardioprotective actions of exosomes derived from hypoxia-treated cells.

Gut epithelial cell-derived exosomes trigger posttrauma immune dysfunction.	J Trauma Acute Care Surg	2018	BACKGROUND: Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that act as endogenous mediators of the immune response. We have previously shown that exosomes released into mesenteric lymph (ML) following trauma (T)/hemorrhagic shock (HS) induce proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages and are involved in the pathogenesis of postshock acute lung injury. However, the cellular origin of ML exosomes and their role in the posttrauma immune response remains unclear. We hypothesized that exosomes released from damaged-intestinal epithelial cells contribute to posttrauma immune dysfunction by altering the function of dendritic cells (DCs), key regulators of the adaptive immunity. METHODS: Male rats underwent cannulation of the femoral artery, jugular vein and ML duct. T/HS was induced by laparotomy and 60 minutes of hemorrhagic shock followed by resuscitation. The ML was collected before (preshock) and after T/HS (post-T/HS) for isolation of exosomes. Surface epitopes of exosomes isolated from ML were assessed by flow cytometry to determine their cellular origin and phenotypic changes. The immunomodulatory effects of ML exosomes on DCs were assessed by Annexin V apoptosis assay, expression of costimulatory molecules, and antigen-presenting capacity to lymphocytes. RESULTS: Exosomes isolated from ML highly expressed CD63 (exosome marker) and epithelial cell-specific marker, suggesting their derivation from intestinal epithelial cells. The expression of immunomodulatory molecules, such as major histocompatibility complex class II and Fas ligand on ML exosomes, was significantly increased after T/HS. Coincubation of DCs with exosomes isolated from ML after T/HS increased DC apoptosis twofold compared with preshock ML exosomes. Furthermore, post-T/HS ML exosomes significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide-mediated expression of CD80 and CD86 on DCs as well as decreased their antigen-presenting capacity to induce lymphocytes proliferation. CONCLUSION: Gut epithelial cells release immunomodulatory exosomes into the ML after T/HS and resuscitation. Mesenteric lymph exosomes may be critical mediators of posttraumatic immunosuppression causing depletion and dysfunction of DCs.

Electronic address: .	mafengxia@ihcams.ac.cn		Exosomes from mesenchymal stromal cells enhance imatinib-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells via activation of caspase signaling pathway.	Cytotherapy	2018	BACKGROUND AIMS: Imatinib (IM), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the BCR-ABL oncoprotein, remains a major therapeutic strategy for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, IM resistance is still a challenge in the treatment of CML. Recently, it was reported that exosomes (Exo) were involved in drug resistance. Therefore, the present study investigated whether Exo secreted by human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (hUC-MSC-Exo) affected the sensitivity of K562 cells to IM. METHODS: hUC-MSC-Exo were isolated and identified. K562 cells were then treated or not with IM (1 µmol/L) in combination with hUC-MSC-Exo (50 µg/mL). Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) and annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, respectively. Apoptotic proteins, caspase and their cleaved forms were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: It was shown that hUC-MSC-Exo alone had no effect on cell viability and apoptosis of K562 cells. However, hUC-MSC-Exo promoted IM-induced cell viability inhibition and apoptosis. Moreover, hUC-MSC-Exo enhanced the increased Bax expression and the decreased Bcl-2 expression that were induced by IM. Compared with IM alone, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were further activated by combination of hUC-MSC-Exo with IM. Finally, the effects of hUC-MSC-Exo on K562 cells could be reversed by pretreatment of K562 cells with caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (30 µmol/L) DISCUSSION: These results indicate that hUC-MSC-Exo enhanced the sensitivity of K562 cells to IM via activation of caspase signaling pathway. Therefore, combining IM with hUC-MSC-Exo could be a promising approach to improve the efficacy of CML treatment.

J Neuroinflammation	2018	BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is implicated in the development and progression of many neurodegenerative diseases. Conditions that lead to a peripheral immune response are often associated with inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting a communication between the peripheral immune system and the neuroimmune system. The underlying mechanism of this relationship remains largely unknown; however, experimental studies have demonstrated that exposure to infectious stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, result in profound peripheral- and neuro-inflammation. METHODS: Using the model of endotoxemia with LPS, we studied the role of serum-derived exosomes in mediating neuroinflammation. We purified circulating exosomes from the sera of LPS-challenged mice, which were then intravenously injected into normal adult mice. RESULTS: We found that the recipient mice that received serum-derived exosomes from LPS-challenged mice exhibited elevated microglial activation. Moreover, we observed astrogliosis, increased systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and elevated CNS expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA and the inflammation-associated microRNA (miR-155) in these recipient mice. Gene expression analysis confirmed that many inflammatory microRNAs were significantly upregulated in the purified exosomes under LPS-challenged conditions. We observed accumulated signaling within the microglia of mice that received tail-vein injections of fluorescently labeled exosomes though the percentage of those microglial cells was found low. Finally, purified LPS-stimulated exosomes from blood when infused directly into the cerebral ventricles provoked significant microgliosis and, to a lesser extent, astrogliosis. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results suggest that circulating exosomes may act as a neuroinflammatory mediator in systemic inflammation.	PMC5759808

Hepatitis C virus direct-acting antivirals therapy impacts on extracellular vesicles microRNAs content and on their immunomodulating properties.	Liver Int	2018	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is known to cause major alterations in the cross-talk between hepatic and immune cells thus contributing to the liver disease pathogenesis. Extracellular vesicles have been proved to act as major players in cell-cell communication, and their cargo changes in relation to pathophysiological states. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic HCV infection and direct-acting antivirals (DAA) on exosome-delivered microRNAs and on their ability to modulate the innate immune response. METHODS: Exosomes isolated from the plasma of healthy donors and naïve, viremic HCV patients before and after DAA treatment have been compared for their microRNAs cargo by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Functional assays with peripheral blood cells from healthy donors were performed to assess exosome-mediated immune responses. RESULTS: MicroRNAs associated with HCV-related immunopathogenesis which were found to be enriched in exosomes of HCV viremic patients (in particular, miR-122-5p, miR-222-3p, miR-146a, miR-150-5p, miR-30c, miR-378a-3p and miR-20a-5p) were markedly reduced by DAA therapy. This exosome-microRNA cargo modulation parallels changes in their immunomodulatory properties in ex vivo experiments. Exosomes from HCV patients inhibit NK degranulation activity and this effect correlates with miR-122-5p or miR-222-3p levels. CONCLUSIONS: Enrichment of immunomodulatory microRNAs in exosomes of HCV patients was correlated with their inhibitory activity on innate immune cells function. Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) treatment was observed to revert both microRNA content and functional profiles of systemic exosomes towards those of healthy donors. Exosome-associated microRNAs may provide valuable biomarkers to monitor immune response recovery.

Exosomal lncRNA 91H is associated with poor development in colorectal cancer by modifying HNRNPK expression.	Cancer Cell Int	2018	Background: Exosomes mediated transfer of lncRNA 91H may play a critical role in the development of CRC. However, few studies have proved the mechanism. So we performed this study to deeply explore the biological functions of exosomal 91H in the development and progression of CRC. Methods: The association between lncRNA 91H and exosomes was detected in vitro and vivo. Then RNA pulldown and RIP were used to detect how lncRNA 91H affect CRC IGF2 express. At last, clinic pathological significance of exosomal 91H was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards model. Results: We found that serum lncRNA 91H expression was closely related to cancer exosomes in vitro and vivo which may enhance tumor-cell migration and invasion in tumor development by modifying HNRNPK expression. Then the clinic pathological significance of exosomal 91H was evaluated which demonstrated that CRC patients with high lncRNA 91H expression usually showed a higher risk in tumor recurrence and metastasis than patients with low lncRNA 91H expression (P < 0.05). Conclusion: All these data suggested that exosomal lncRNA 91H enhancing CRC metastasis by modifying HNRNPK expression might be an early plasma-based biomarker for CRC recurrence or metastasis. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm our findings.	PMC5781274

Eosinophil-derived exosomes contribute to asthma remodelling by activating structural lung cells.	Clin Exp Allergy	2018	BACKGROUND: Eosinophils, a central factor in asthma pathogenesis, have the ability to secrete exosomes. However, the precise role played by exosomes in the biological processes leading up to asthma has not been fully defined. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that exosomes released by eosinophils contribute to asthma pathogenesis by activating structural lung cells. METHODS: Eosinophils from asthmatic patients and healthy volunteers were purified from peripheral blood, and exosomes were isolated from eosinophils of asthmatic and healthy individuals. All experiments were performed with eosinophil-derived exosomes from healthy and asthmatic subjects. Epithelial damage was evaluated using primary small airway epithelial cell lines through 2 types of apoptosis assays, that is, flow cytometry and TUNEL assay with confocal microscopy. Additionally, the epithelial repair was analysed by performing wound healing assays with epithelial cells. Functional studies such as proliferation and inhibition-proliferation assays were carried out in primary bronchial smooth muscle cell lines. Also, gene expression analysis of pro-inflammatory molecules was evaluated by real-time PCR on epithelial and muscle cells. Lastly, protein expression of epithelial and muscle cell signalling factors was estimated by Western blot. RESULTS: Asthmatic eosinophil-derived exosomes induced an increase in epithelial cell apoptosis at 24 hour and 48 hour, impeding wound closure. In addition, muscle cell proliferation was increased at 72 hours after exosome addition and was linked with higher phosphorylation of ERK1/2. We also found higher expression of several genes when both cell types were cultured in the presence of exosomes from asthmatics: CCR3 and VEGFA in muscle cells, and CCL26, TNF and POSTN in epithelial cells. Healthy eosinophil-derived exosomes did not exert any effect over these cell types. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Eosinophil-derived exosomes from asthmatic patients participate actively in the development of the pathological features of asthma via structural lung cells.

J Am Heart Assoc	2018	BACKGROUND: Obesity is causally associated with atherosclerosis, and adipose tissue (AT)-derived exosomes may be implicated in the metabolic complications of obesity. However, the precise role of AT-exosomes in atherogenesis remains unclear. We herein aimed to assess the effect of AT-exosomes on macrophage foam cell formation and polarization and subsequent atherosclerosis development. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four types of exosomes isolated from the supernatants of ex vivo subcutaneous AT and visceral AT (VAT) explants that were derived from wild-type mice and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice were effectively taken up by RAW264.7 macrophages. Both treatment with wild-type VAT exosomes and HFD-VAT exosomes, but not subcutaneous AT exosomes, markedly facilitated macrophage foam cell generation through the downregulation of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1 and ABCG1)-mediated cholesterol efflux. Decreased expression of liver X receptor-α was also observed. Among the 4 types of exosomes, only HFD-VAT exosomes significantly induced M1 phenotype transition and proinflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 6) secretion in RAW264.7 macrophages, which was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of NF-κB-p65 but not the cellular expression of NF-κB-p65 or IκB-α. Furthermore, systematic intravenous injection of HFD-VAT exosomes profoundly exacerbated atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, as indicated by the M1 marker (CD16/32 and inducible nitric oxide synthase)-positive areas and the Oil Red O/Sudan IV-stained area, without affecting the plasma lipid profile and body weight. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a proatherosclerotic role for HFD-VAT exosomes, which is exerted by regulating macrophage foam cell formation and polarization, indicating a novel link between AT and atherosclerosis in the context of obesity.

AAPS J	2018	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) comprise a heterogeneous group of small membrane vesicles, including exosomes, which play a critical role in intracellular communication and regulation of numerous physiological processes in health and disease. Naturally released from virtually all cells, these vesicles contain an array of nucleic acids, lipids and proteins which they transfer to target cells within their local milieu and systemically. They have been proposed as a means of "cell-free, cell therapy" for cancer, immune disorders, and more recently cardiovascular disease. In addition, their unique properties of stability, biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity have prompted research into their potential as therapeutic delivery agents for drugs and small molecules. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of extracellular vesicle biology as well as engineering strategies in play to improve their therapeutic potential.

Exosomes from Irradiated Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer Cells Reduced Sensitivity of Recipient Cells to Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Inhibitors.	Mol Pharm	2018	Exosomes, released from various cell types, serve as vehicles of intercellular communication. Rearranged anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been detected in exosomes released from cancer cells in ALK-positive nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however, the functional consequence of ALK in exosomes has not been studied. This study aims to address whether exosomal ALK release is affected by stress, and whether exosomal ALK can modulate survival of recipient cells in vitro and in vivo. Exosomes, isolated from ALK-containing H3122 cells with (Exo-Apo) or without (Exo-Ctrl) irradiation treatment, were transferred to recipient H3122 cells in vitro or mouse xenograft in vivo. Western blot, flow cytometry, MTT, and xenograft were employed to respectively assess activation of the ALK pathway, apoptosis, cell viability, and tumor growth. Exo-Apo contained much higher levels of phosphorylated ALK (p-ALK) than that of Exo-Ctrl, and it activated AKT, STAT3, and the ERK pathway in recipient H3122 cells. ALK-specific inhibitors, including Crizotinib, Ceritinib, and TAE684, exhibited less effects on H3122 cells preincubated with Exo-Apo than on those treated with Exo-Ctrl in either inhibition of cell viability or promotion of apoptosis. Moreover, in an H3122 xenograft model, the Exo-Apo treatment resulted in a greater tumor growth and less sensitivity to Ceritinib than the Exo-Ctrl treatment. The ALK protein cargo in exosomes could be a key element to drive tumor growth and compromise therapeutic efficacy of ALK inhibitors for ALK-positive NSCLC.

Biochem Biophys Res Commun	2018	BACKGROUND: Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) play a critical role in the regulation of hair follicle (HF) growth, formation, and cycling. DPCs are thought to regulate HF growth through a paracrine mechanism, in which exosomes may play a critical role. METHODS: DPC-Exos were cutaneously injected into HFs at different HF cycle stages and the effects were evaluated by histological and immunohistochemical analyses. The effects of DPC-Exos on proliferation, migration, and cell cycle status of outer root sheath cells (ORSCs) were evaluated. After treatment of DPC-Exos, changes in mRNA and protein levels of β-catenin and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in ORSCs were detected. RESULTS: DPC-Exos were approximately 105 nm in diameter and expressed tumor susceptibility gene 101, cluster of differentiation (CD)9, and CD63. Injection of DPC-Exos accelerated the onset of HF anagen and delayed catagen in mice. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that β-catenin and Shh levels were upregulated in the skin. In vitro, DPC-Exo treatment enhanced ORSC proliferation and migration, and stimulated the expression of β-catenin and Shh. CONCLUSION: DPC-Exos contribute to the regulation of HF growth and development, and provide a potential avenue for the treatment of hair loss.

J Extracell Vesicles	2018	Newts can regenerate amputated limbs and cardiac tissue, unlike mammals which lack broad regenerative capacity. Several signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival during newt tissue regeneration have been elucidated, however the factors that coordinate signaling between cells, as well as the conservation of these factors in other animals, are not well defined. Here we report that media conditioned by newt limb explant cells (A1 cells) protect mammalian cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. The cytoprotective effect of A1-conditioned media was negated by exposing A1 cells to GW4869, which suppresses the generation of extracellular vesicles (EVs). A1-EVs are similar in diameter (~100-150 nm), structure, and share several membrane surface and cargo proteins with mammalian exosomes. However, isolated A1-EVs contain significantly higher levels of both RNA and protein per particle than mammalian EVs. Additionally, numerous cargo RNAs and proteins are unique to A1-EVs. Of particular note, A1-EVs contain numerous mRNAs encoding nuclear receptors, membrane ligands, as well as transcription factors. Mammalian cardiomyocytes treated with A1-EVs showed increased expression of genes in the PI3K/AKT pathway, a pivotal player in survival signaling. We conclude that newt cells secrete EVs with diverse, distinctive RNA and protein contents. Despite ~300 million years of evolutionary divergence between newts and mammals, newt EVs confer cytoprotective effects on mammalian cardiomyocytes.	PMC5912190
29739042	Jie Zhang				Potential Value of Urinary Exosome-Derived let-7c-5p in the Diagnosis and Progression of Type II Diabetic Nephropathy.	Clin Lab	2018	BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Reliable biomarkers are demanded for the non-invasive diagnosis of DN. This study aims to investigate whether miRNA in urinary exosomes could serve as a potential biomarker in the diagnosis and progression of DN. METHODS: Urine samples were collected from fifteen healthy controls, twenty type II diabetes without DN and twenty-eight type II patients with DN who underwent kidney biopsy. Differential centrifugation was used to isolate exosomes from urine samples and exosomes were confirmed by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and western blot. MiRNAs including let-7c-5p, miR-29c-5p, miR-15b-5p, and RNU6 were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Electron microscopy and NTA verified a typical shape of exosomes with an average diameter of 100.7 nm, and western blot identified the presence of CD9, Alix, and TSG101 on exosomes. let-7c-5p was significantly upregulated in urinary exosomes of DN patients compared with controls (p < 0.05), while miR-29c-5p and miR-15b-5p were significantly downregulated compared with healthy controls (p < 0.05). let-7c-5p is correlated with both estimated glomerular filtration rate (r = -0.723, p < 0.001) and progression of DN. All three miRNAs, let-7c-5p, miR29c-5p, and miR-15b-5p, could predict DN with AUC of 0.818, 0.774, and 0.818, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary exosome-derived let-7c-5p is correlated with both renal function and progression of DN, suggesting it as a potential biomarker for DN.

Int J Mol Sci	2018	In this study, we report how the cholera toxin (CT) A subunit (CTA), the enzyme moiety responsible for signaling alteration in host cells, enters the exosomal pathway, secretes extracellularly, transmits itself to a cell population. The first evidence for long-term transmission of CT's toxic effect via extracellular vesicles was obtained in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. To follow the CT intracellular route towards exosome secretion, we used a novel strategy for generating metabolically-labeled fluorescent exosomes that can be counted by flow cytometry assay (FACS) and characterized. Our results clearly show the association of CT with exosomes, together with the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) molecules, proteins required for translocation of CTA across the ER membrane into the cytoplasm. Confocal microscopy showed direct internalization of CT containing fluorescent exo into CHO cells coupled with morphological changes in the recipient cells that are characteristic of CT action. Moreover, Me665 cells treated with CT-containing exosomes showed an increase in Adenosine 3',5'-Cyclic Monophosphate (cAMP) level, reaching levels comparable to those seen in cells exposed directly to CT. Our results prompt the idea that CT can exploit an exosome-mediated cell communication pathway to extend its pathophysiological action beyond an initial host cell, into a multitude of cells. This finding could have implications for cholera disease pathogenesis and epidemiology.
